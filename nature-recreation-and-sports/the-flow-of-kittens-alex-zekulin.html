  <title>The Flow of Kittens - Alex Zekulin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most of us have been to a pet store looking at the kittens and puppies up for adoption.  We&#39;ve watched whole litters of puppies and kittens at play.  These tiny balls of fur and fluff briefly stop their antics to stare at us, as we stare lovingly at them.  Deep down we wish we could take them all home with us.  
Have you ever wondered what it would be like to adopt a whole litter of kittens at once?  Have you ever wondered what they were thinking?  Most of us have a pet cat or dog, maybe two.  These pets become a part of our family; we love them, nurture them, put up with them, and cry for them.  
This book tells the story of our adventures as we adopt a litter of four kittens right from our front porch.  The story is told from both my point of view and that of Patches, one of our four kittens.  There is a different dynamic raising a whole litter in the house.  It&#39;s like having a family within a family!  These little bundles of high spirited joy lifted our hearts in ways we did not expect, right when we needed it most.  Truly little miracles!" />
