  <title>Bowls, Polls, and Tattered Souls: Tackling the Chaos and Controversy That Reign Over College Football - Stewart Mandel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SI.com &quot;College Football Mailbag&quot; author Stewart Mandel tackles the ten issues that confound college football fans--with a new chapter on the 2007 season.&lt;P&gt;&quot;An intricate tour through the ills of the college football world (and there are many), but still manages to take on a breezy, airy tone.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--The Quad, NYTimes.com&lt;P&gt;&quot;Stewart Mandel writes about college football&#39;s major controversies with a wit and depth of knowledge that will impress even the most obsessed fans. And because he&#39;s both fair and objective, there is something in this book to infuriate nearly everyone.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--Warren St. John, author of the bestselling Rammer Jammer Yellow Hammer: A Road Trip into the Heart of Fan Mania&lt;P&gt;&quot;In a book dripping with sarcasm, Stewart Mandel plays tour guide on an interesting ride through the college football nuthouse.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--Bruce Feldman, author of Meat Market and senior writer for ESPN the Magazine&lt;P&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re confused by the world of college football, particularly the BCS and how the present polls are conducted, then I will recommend to you Bowls, Polls &amp; Tattered Souls.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--Football Outsiders&lt;P&gt;&quot;Presents history and insights on all aspects of the sport, from recruiting to the bowl system to why certain teams play in certain conferences. A great read for fans with thirty days or thirty years of experience.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;--Orlando Sentinel&lt;P&gt;If your heart beats faster on Saturday afternoons as your team takes the field, this book will give you new insight into the fanaticism and chaos that characterize college football today. Stewart Mandel takes a provocative, hard-hitting look at the hot-button issues: the controversial BCS; the polls and their largely arbitrary rankings; the ego-inflating recruiting craze; cheating and recent scandals; the huge pressures and salaries heaped on coaches; the Heisman hype-fest; the NFL draft; the clunky conference expansions; privileged Notre Dame, college football&#39;s greatest juggernaut; and the proliferation of bowl games. You&#39;ll get behind-the-scenes insights on how the issues evolved and why some are almost impossible to resolve in a book that&#39;s as entertaining, passionate, and thought-provoking as the game itself." />
