  <title>World Ending Fire - Wendell Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In a time when our relationship to the natural world is ruled by the violence and greed of unbridled consumerism, Wendell Berry speaks out in these prescient essays, drawn from his 50-year campaign on behalf of American lands and communities &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mr. Berry&#39;s sentences and stories deliver a great payload of edifying entertainment, which I hungrily consume, but it is the bass note of morality thumping through his musical phrases that guides me with the most constant of hands upon my plow.&quot; —Nick Offerman, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Paddle Your Own Canoe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Read [Berry] with pencil in hand, make notes and hope that somehow our country and the world will soon come to see the truth that is told here.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;He is unlike anybody else writing today…&quot; —Andrew Marr, &lt;i&gt;New Statesman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;The rarest (and highest) of literary classes consist of that small group of authors who are absolutely inimitable… One of the half-dozen living American authors who belongs in this class is Wendell Berry.&quot; —&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;
Wendell Berry began his life in post-war America as the old times and the last of the old-time people were dying out, and continues to this day in the old ways: a team of work horses and a pencil are his preferred working tools. The writings gathered in &lt;i&gt;The World-Ending Fire&lt;/i&gt; are the unique product of a life spent farming the fields of rural Kentucky with mules and horses, and of the rich, intimate knowledge of the land cultivated by this work. These are essays written in defiance of the false call to progress and in defense of local landscapes, essays that celebrate our cultural heritage, our history, and our home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With grace and conviction, he shows that we simply cannot afford to succumb to the mass-produced madness that drives our global economy—the natural world will not survive it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Yet he also shares with us a vision of consolation and of hope. We may be locked in an uneven struggle, but we can and must begin to treat our land, our neighbours, and ourselves with respect and care. As Berry urges, we must abandon arrogance and stand in awe." />
