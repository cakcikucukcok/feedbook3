  <title>Beginners Guide to Metal Detecting - Julian Evan-Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This best-selling book is both aimed at the beginner and someone who is perhaps considering taking up metal detecting. However it also contains information that the more experienced detectorist may find very useful. After a combined 70 years metal detecting Dave Stuckey and I decided that we had a large amount of research information that allowed us in most cases to quickly assess the potential of areas to search. Why should everyone else have to wait that long to get the same benefits as we had? We simply had to share it all. Who would guess that a flock of birds might just reveal the site of a Roman villa or a cluster of molehills be the site of a Georgian manor house? Those pieces of twisted metal you have just found might actually pin point the site of a crashed wartime aeroplane. Just like a forensic examination every investigative factor is covered here, what might it reveal for you? Written in an &quot;easy read&quot; style with high quality colour illustrations it is perhaps that ideal Christmas or birthday present, or indeed anytime gift for that person in your life you know is or could well become very interested in metal detecting.  &quot;" />
