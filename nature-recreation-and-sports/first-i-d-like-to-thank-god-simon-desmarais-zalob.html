  <title>First, I’D Like to Thank God - simon desmarais-zalob</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you ever wonder why athletes always seem to thank God, first and foremost, in post-game interviews? Or why they point to the heavens following a home run or a touchdown? &lt;p&gt;
This book takes a look at the relationship between top athletes and religiosity (or spirituality) in a number of different ways. It aims to address the issues of when sport and religion began to merge, whether professional athletes are, in fact, more religious than the rest of the population, how a spiritual mindset might (or might not) benefit athletes, and why wearing the same underwear during a winning streak has anything to do with religious faith. These questions are confronted by looking at psychological and sociological studies, conducting original research, and examining exclusive interviews with professional athletes. &lt;p&gt;
So what does a player like Jerry Stackhouse think of the culture of faith in the NBA? How does an agnostic athlete view the religiously themed celebrations in the NFL? Are top performers in other walks of life just as religious as top athletes? The results might surprise you.&lt;p&gt;" />
