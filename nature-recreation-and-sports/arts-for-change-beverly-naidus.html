  <title>Arts for Change - Beverly Naidus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Arts for Change&lt;/i&gt; presents strategies and theory for teaching socially engaged art with an historical and contemporary overview of the field. The book features interviews with over thirty maverick artists/faculty from colleges and universities in the United States, Canada, and Great Britain, whose pedagogy is drawn from and informs activist arts practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issues these teaching artists address are provocative and diverse. Some came to this work through personal healing from injustice and trauma or by witnessing oppressions that became intolerable. Many have taught for decades, deeply influenced by social movements of the 1960s and 1970s, yet because the work is controversial, tenured positions are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
