  <title>1001 Climbing Tips - Andy Kirkpatrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine an alien came down to Earth, stuck a probe into a climber&#39;s brain - one who&#39;d been climbing for over thirty years - and then transmogrified the contents into a big book of climbing tips. Well, 1001 Climbing Tips by Andy Kirkpatrick is just such a book. This is no regular instruction manual - it&#39;s much more useful than that. This is a massive collection of all those little tips that make a real difference when at the crag, in the mountains, or when you&#39;re planning your next big trip. It&#39;s for anyone who hangs off stuff, or just hangs around in the mountains. These tips are based on three decades of climbing obsession, as well as nineteen ascents of El Cap, numerous Alpine north faces, trips to the polar ice caps, and many other scary climbs and expeditions. 1001 Climbing Tips covers the following areas: BASICS [1-240] From how best to rope up and the importance of climbing partnerships, to racking your gear correctly and how to sleep in a harness. This section is designed for both novice and experienced climbers. SAFETY [241-327] The name of the game in climbing is staying alive and coming home in one piece. This section covers loose rock, rescue, dealing with heat and what to do if you get caught out. BIG WALL [328-434] Knowledge on tackling large multi-pitch climbs, with advanced topics such as pegging, jumaring, hauling and speed climbing. These tips will be an aid both to those new to multi-pitch climbing, as well as more experienced climbers. ICE [435-481] Tips on all aspects of ice climbing, including movement, protection, looking after your gear, mental strength and - of course - not falling off. MIXED [482-503] With a focus on Scottish and Alpine winter skills, these essential tips focus on how to use your tools on snowed-up rock, leading, gear and footwork on mixed ground. MOUNTAIN [504-802] Essential reading for mountaineers, hill walkers and rock climbers, this section has almost 300 tips on living and staying alive in the mountains, be that in the UK, Alps or Greater Ranges. TRAINING [803-876] A range of tips on how to overcome fear, improve strength and endurance, as well as diet and nutrition advice for climbers. STUFF [877-1001] A mix of esoterica, such as how to rap off a fifi hook, what books to read, how to make your own kit, how to get sponsored, photo and video advice, and how to go to the toilet in tricky spots." />
