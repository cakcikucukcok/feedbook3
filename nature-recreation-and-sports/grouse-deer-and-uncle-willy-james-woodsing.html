  <title>Grouse, Deer, and Uncle Willy - James Woodsing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Adobe Garamond Pro&#39;&quot;&gt;Hey Jim buddy, after lunch how about if you, Cousin Jack, and I head to the back of the farm and do some target practicing with the 22? Uncle Willy sensed that his 12 year old nephew, Jim, was ready to be introduced to shooting a rifle. The long-lasting nephew-uncle relationship that began with brook trout fishing was now going to involve grouse and deer hunting. Their many hunting adventures led to a strong bond for each and a mutual love for hunting. The stories are told and illustrated with genuine enthusiasm and realism, taking us into the forest and providing a real feeling of participation. Jim learns how to fire a rifle without flinching, where and how to hunt for grouse and deer, how to train a grouse dog, what wood ticks are, and the value of a compass, especially when lost. Jim and his buddies go grouse hunting and end up shooting chimneys and each others caps. Many trips to the hunting camp are enjoyed where Uncle Willy tells stories about buck fever. After being misplaced in the family for 7 decades, Jim&#39;s dad&#39;s 30-40 Krag is uncovered and Jim is excited to be hunting with it. At 92 years old, Uncle Willy has a keen memory for their hunting experiences. He says, Jim, I remember when you bagged your first grouse with your single shot 22 on that old logging road by Black Crick. I was ready with my 20 GA in case you missed. But you didn&#39;t flinch and you didn&#39;t miss. That was a good shot.&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
