  <title>The Only Rule Is It Has to Work - Ben Lindbergh, Sam Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller about what would happen if two statistics-minded outsiders were allowed to run a professional baseball team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the ultimate in fantasy baseball: You get to pick the roster, set the lineup, and decide on strategies -- with real players, in a real ballpark, in a real playoff race. That&#39;s what baseball analysts Ben Lindbergh and Sam Miller got to do when an independent minor-league team in California, the Sonoma Stompers, offered them the chance to run its baseball operations according to the most advanced statistics. Their story in &lt;i&gt;The Only Rule is it Has to Work &lt;/i&gt;is unlike any other baseball tale you&#39;ve ever read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We tag along as Lindbergh and Miller apply their number-crunching insights to all aspects of assembling and running a team, following one cardinal rule for judging each innovation they try: &lt;i&gt;it has to work.&lt;/i&gt; We meet colorful figures like general manager Theo Fightmaster and boundary-breakers like the first openly gay player in professional baseball. Even José Canseco makes a cameo appearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will their knowledge of numbers help Lindbergh and Miller bring the Stompers a championship, or will they fall on their faces? Will the team have a competitive advantage or is the sport&#39;s folk wisdom true after all? Will the players attract the attention of big-league scouts, or are they on a fast track to oblivion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a wild ride, by turns provocative and absurd, as Lindbergh and Miller tell a story that will speak to numbers geeks and traditionalists alike. And they prove that you don&#39;t need a bat or a glove to make a genuine contribution to the game.&lt;/p&gt;" />
