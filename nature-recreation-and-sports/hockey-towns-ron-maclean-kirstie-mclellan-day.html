  <title>Hockey Towns - Ron MacLean, Kirstie McLellan Day</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Every Canadian town has a hockey story, and Ron MacLean has a hockey story for every town. A new book by the co-author of the national bestseller &lt;em&gt;Cornered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you first meet Ron MacLean, he asks where you’re from, and he always comes back with a story. No one has crossed this country more than MacLean. In his 28 years on &lt;em&gt;Hockey Night in Canada&lt;/em&gt; and now as host of Rogers’ &lt;em&gt;Hometown Hockey&lt;/em&gt;, Ron has met fascinating people from coast to coast and has great stories to tell. Now, in this new book, MacLean is back, with brand new tales from across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are stories you’ve never heard before. From London to Castlegar, Yellowknife to Cole Harbour, Medicine Hat to Trois Rivieres, from Bantam to Junior B to the NHL, our country is full of great characters: Players, coaches, hockey moms and hockey dads; rivalries, practical jokes, careers that grew out of nothing and &quot;can’t lose&quot; prospects who flamed out too soon; spectacular triumphs, heart-breaking tragedies and tales of friendship, betrayal, love and loyalty—all compelling, entertaining and inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again working with Kirstie McLellan Day, co-author of the blockbuster bestsellers &lt;em&gt;Playing With Fire, Tough Guy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Cornered&lt;/em&gt;, this is MacLean at his finest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
