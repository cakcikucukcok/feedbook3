  <title>Lure of the Mountains - Michael D. Lowes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lure of the Mountains is the first published biography of accomplished photographer, ornithologist, teacher and 1924 Everest expedition member Bentley Beetham (1886-1963). Written by the late Michael D. Lowes, a pupil of Beetham&#39;s at Barnard Castle School in County Durham, and with a foreword by Graham Ratcliffe MBE, the first Briton to have summited Everest from both the North and South sides, and also a pupil of Barnard Castle School. Lure of the Mountains charts Beetham&#39;s life from childhood in Darlington, to rock climbing in the Lake District, to his selection by the Mount Everest Committee as a member of the infamous and ill-fated 1924 Everest Expedition on which George Mallory and Sandy Irvine disappeared high on the mountain. Many of Beetham&#39;s images, including those made on the 1924 expedition, were for over 25 years curated by Michael Lowes and are reproduced in this book with the kind permission of the Bentley Beetham Trust and Durham University. His images of Tibet are &#39;an important historical record of Tibetan culture and a way of life that in modern times has rapidly begun to disappear&#39;. Beetham was a highly skilled rock climber and a pioneer of new routes in the Borrowdale Valley, where he established such notable climbs as Little Chamonix on Shepherd&#39;s Crag, and Corvus on Raven Crag. The author, like many other pupils Beetham inspired, was introduced to climbing by his teacher in the Lake District on club trips, and over the years he became a valuable source of information and expert on Beetham&#39;s life and work." />
