  <title>Walking Albuquerque: 30 Tours of the Duke City&#39;s Historic Neighborhoods, Ditch Trails, Urban Nature, and Public Art - Stephen Ausherman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Given its history and massive sprawl, we must admit that, unlike Nancy Sinatra&amp;#8217;s boots, Albuquerque was not made for walking. However, that doesn&amp;#8217;t mean the art of walking has met its demise here. A resurgence in plans and efforts to make it walkable again indicates that the city is on the verge of a pedestrian renaissance. In the meantime, navigating it by foot requires some local guidance and expertise. That&amp;#8217;s where &lt;I&gt;Walking Albuquerque&lt;/I&gt; by local author and explorer Stephen Ausherman comes in handy. With 30 routes mapped out in the valley, the heights, and beyond, it&amp;#8217;s the first guidebook of its kind to cover the entire city and surrounding areas, including tourist sites and famous filming locations along with several hidden treasures most local don&amp;#8217;t even know about. Rich in history and obsessive in detail, &lt;I&gt;Walking Albuquerque&lt;/I&gt; is written to encourage readers to take the next step and make each walk an enjoyable little journey.&lt;/div&gt;" />
