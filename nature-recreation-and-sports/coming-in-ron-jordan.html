  <title>Coming In - Ron Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A wind comes blowing, bringing another new day with each breaking dawn. Another day of toil, and oftentimes tribulation, mixed with affection for the land upon which he lives and works, the cowhand&#39;s existence is a bond between nature and the folks he has come to know and respect. His very existence is the epitome of a freedom that most folks will never know, but merely dream of. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These are the heart-rending tales of life in southeastern Wyoming, living and working with ranchers and ranch hands, cowboys and cowpokes, and the occasional suburbanite in search of the real west. The edge of civilization rises on a near horizon and with its arrival ushers the end of a western heritage and the cowboy culture that few outsiders will ever comprehend. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Written with truthfulness and candor, the author weaves a tapestry of stories and personal experiences, forever mindful of the fabric of life that holds this vanishing and fragile rural society together. Provocative, this is a perspective unlike any other ever presented. Anguish . . . coupled with brutal honesty and compassion for the working ranch hand in the American west, this is a brotherhood of understanding. &lt;/P&gt;" />
