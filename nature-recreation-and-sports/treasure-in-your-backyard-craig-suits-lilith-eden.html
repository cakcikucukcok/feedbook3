  <title>Treasure in Your Backyard - Craig Suits, Lilith Eden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The unlikely writing alliance between Lilith Eden and Craig Suits came about through a mutual membership in a highly prestigious blog site called Hubpages.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Suits explains that while reviewing new bloggers, he was attracted by Liliths pretty face and went on to read a few of her submissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captivated by her college-trained literary style, he commented on each of her blogs and she quickly responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discovered and eerie similarity between two separate blogs each had written that caused conversation to bloom on one of the internets video communication programs and the coalition was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thousand miles and 46 years apart, Craigs field experience and Liliths literary knowledge led to their first book as co-authors: Treasure In Your Backyard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are currently working on a science fiction thriller, which they hope will make it to the big screen.&lt;/p&gt;
