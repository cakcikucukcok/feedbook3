  <title>The Man Who Talks to Dogs - Melinda Roth, Michael W. Fox, Tony La Russa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Go to any unpopulated or abandoned area in any given urban setting, and you&#39;ll find them. Thousands and thousands of wild dogs-abandoned to disease, starvation, and inevitable death-are leading short and brutal lives in the no-man&#39;s-land between domestication and wildness, byproducts of the human destitution around them. A lucky few are saved by dedicated rescuers, and Randy Grim, has emerged as one of the country&#39;s leading dog saviors. After years of rescuing dogs on his own, he founded Stray Rescue of St. Louis, an organization dedicated to rescue and rehabilitation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are dogs that belong to no one, the ones animal-control experts can&#39;t catch and humane shelters won&#39;t deal with. They are stray or feral, either abandoned or born wild on the streets, which means they won&#39;t come near humans and statistically won&#39;t live past their second year. And their numbers are growing every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Talks to Dogs&lt;/i&gt;, journalist Melinda Roth narrates Grim&#39;s dramatic, inspiring efforts and tells the horrific and heartwarming stories of the dogs he saves, showing how this growing national health problem-controlled by no federal or local regulations-can no longer be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;" />
