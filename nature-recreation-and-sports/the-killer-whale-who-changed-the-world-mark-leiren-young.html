That all changed when a young killer whale was captured off the west coast of North America and displayed to the public in 1964. Moby Doll &amp;#151; as the whale became known &amp;#151; was an instant celebrity, drawing 20,000 visitors on the one and only day he was exhibited. He died within a few months, but his famous gentleness sparked a worldwide crusade that transformed how people understood and appreciated orcas. Because of Moby Doll, we stopped fearing &amp;#147;killers&amp;#8221; and grew to love and respect &amp;#147;orcas.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;" />
