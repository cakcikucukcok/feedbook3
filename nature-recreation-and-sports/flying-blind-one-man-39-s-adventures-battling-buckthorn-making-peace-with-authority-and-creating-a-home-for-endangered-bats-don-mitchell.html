  <title>Flying Blind: One Man&#39;s Adventures Battling Buckthorn, Making Peace with Authority, and Creating a Home for Endangered Bats - Don Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Middlebury writing professor Don Mitchell was approached by a biologist with the Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department about tracking endangered Indiana bats on his 150-acre farm in Vermont&#39;s picturesque Champlain Valley, Mitchell&#39;s relationship with bats&amp;#8212;and with government&amp;#8212;could be characterized as distrustful, at best.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; But the flying rats, as Mitchell initially thinks of them, launched him on a series of &quot;improvements&quot; to his land that would provide a more welcoming habitat for the bats&amp;#8212;and a modest tax break for himself and his family. Whether persuading his neighbors to join him on a &quot;silent meditation,&quot; pulling invasive garlic mustard out of the ground by hand, navigating the tacit ground rules of buying an ATV off Craigslist, or leaving just enough honeysuckle to give government inspectors &quot;something to find,&quot; Mitchell&amp;#8217;s tale is as profound as it is funny&amp;#8212;a journey that changes Mitchell&amp;#8217;s relationship with Chiroptera, the land, and, ultimately, his understanding of his own past.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt; Ruminating on the nature of authority, the purview of the state, and the value of inhabiting one&amp;#8217;s niche&amp;#8212;Mitchell reveals much about our inner and outer landscape, in this perfectly paced and skilled story of place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
