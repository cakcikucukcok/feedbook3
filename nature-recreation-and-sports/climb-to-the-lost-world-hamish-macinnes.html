  <title>Climb to the Lost World - Hamish MacInnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over 9,000 feet up on the top of &lt;b&gt;Mount Roraima&lt;/b&gt; is a twenty-five mile square plateau, at the point where Guyana’s border meets Venezuela and Brazil. In 1973, Scottish mountaineering legend &lt;b&gt;Hamish MacInnes&lt;/b&gt; alongside climbing notoriety &lt;b&gt;Don Whillans, Mo Anthoine&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Joe Brown&lt;/b&gt; trekked through dense rainforest and swamp, and climbed the sheer overhanging sandstone wall of the great prow in order to conquer this Conan Doyle fantasy summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As one of the last unexplored corners of the world, in order to reach the foot of the prow the motley yet vastly experienced expedition trudged through a saturated world of bizarre vegetation, fantastically contorted slime-coated trees and deep white mud; a world dominated by bushmaster snakes, scorpions and giant bird-eating spiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This wasn’t the end of it, however. The stately prow itself posed extreme technical complications: the rock was streaming with water, and the few-and-far-between ledges were teeming with scorpion-haunted bromeliads. This was not a challenge to be taken lightly. However, if anyone was going to do it, it was going to be this group of UK climbing pioneers, backed by &lt;i&gt;The Observer&lt;/i&gt;, supported by the Guyanan Government, and accompanied by a BBC camera team, their mission was very much in the public eye.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Climb to the Lost World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a story of discovering an alien world of tortured rock formations, sunken gardens and magnificent waterfalls, combined with the trials and tribulations of day-to-day expedition life. MacInnes’ dry humour and perceptive observations of his companions, flora and fauna relay the story of this first ascent with passion and in true explorer style.&lt;/p&gt;" />
