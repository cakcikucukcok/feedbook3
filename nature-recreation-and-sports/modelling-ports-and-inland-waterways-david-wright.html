  <title>Modelling Ports and Inland Waterways - David Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This wide ranging and informative book, which is brimming with practical advice, is aimed at all those who wish to create authentic models of ports, canals, quays, wharfs and their associated railway infrastructure. Topics covered in this new book include the history of ports and inland waterways, and the important role played by the railways in facilitating their operation; layout plans and ideas, all based on prototypes, that are aimed specifically at the scratch builder; a selection of modelling projects are included with dioramas of both a canal wharf and two different estuary ports, supported by nearly 400 hundred step-by-step colour photographs, drawings and track plans. Finally, it covers the modelling and painting techniques that can be used to create realistic-looking water and how models can be made more convincing and brought to life by the addition of appropriate colouring and weathering. This practical guide is aimed at railway modellers of all abilities, and will also be of interest to modellers in general. Beautifully illustrated with 394 colour step-by-step photographs, drawings and track plans." />
