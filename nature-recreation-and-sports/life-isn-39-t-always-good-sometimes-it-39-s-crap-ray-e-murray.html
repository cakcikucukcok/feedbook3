  <title>Life Isn&#39;t Always Good... Sometimes It&#39;s Crap! - Ray E. Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;There are millions of choices for a reader to select while browsing in a book store. I hope that the title Life Isn&#39;t Always Good . . . Sometimes It&#39;s CRAP caught your eye and sparked your interest to leaf through the contents of this book. When the book has been read in its entirety, you will realize that I do not believe &quot;Life is Crap&quot;. On the contrary, I believe that &quot;Life is Good&quot;. In the wilderness, Crap can creep in when least expected. At that very moment it can make you feel that &quot;Life is Crap&quot;. Trapped on a mountain during a lightning storm is one of those moments. Tossed out of a kayak into a raging river alone and paddle less, qualifies as a &quot;Life is Crap&quot; moment. Driving along on an ATV can go from great to Crap in the blink of an eye. These are true events that have happened along the way. They are funny, sad, and some of them are blatantly dangerous. If you are planning an outdoor excursion, be aware that there are risks. Prepare yourself as well as possible, and hopefully you have planned out the CRAP.&lt;/div&gt;" />
