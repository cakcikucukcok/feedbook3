Warjac&amp;#39;s new friends didn&amp;#39;t know much about him. As far as they knew, his name actually was Bob King and he was running an upper-crust apartment building, the Biltmore, in Los Angeles.

He had seen FBI agents filtering through the Sands casino. He saw the fliers they were distributing. The man he knew as Bob King also was known as Warjac, a fugitive on the lam for five years after a Texas jailbreak.This wasn&amp;#39;t Warjac&amp;#39;s first time on the run.

He left the main roads at times, piloting the Buick at high speeds for long stretches in the darkness across the desert scrub land.He and Earlene had no choice but to get back to Los Angeles. He knew the FBI would have their apartment under surveillance, so he and Earlene couldn&amp;#39;t even stop there for a change of clothes. But if they could just make it through the night, he had a friend who could get them some money and the documents they would need to escape across the border into Mexico. Warjac knew someone had ratted on them. He wasn&amp;#39;t sure if there was anyone he could trust. So they pulled into a parking lot north of Los Angeles and got some sleep on the beach.
