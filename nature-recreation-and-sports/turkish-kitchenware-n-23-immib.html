  <title>Turkish Kitchenware N. 23 - Immib</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We have met with you at the Ambiente Fair, one of the great meeting points in the&lt;br /&gt;
kitchenware and housewares sector. We are extremely excited and honored to attend the&lt;br /&gt;
Ambiente 2017 Fair for the 22nd time together with our 72 companies that are&lt;br /&gt;
Istanbul Minerals and Metals Exporters&amp;rsquo; Association (?MM?B) members and delegates&lt;br /&gt;
from Turkish national participation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkish houseware and kitchenware continues to expand globally with new fairs and&lt;br /&gt;
organizations. Istanbul Ferrous &amp;amp; Non-Ferrous Metals Exporters&amp;rsquo; Association (?DDM?B)&lt;br /&gt;
organizes the first national participation to Spring Fair with the participation of 10&lt;br /&gt;
companies in Birmingham, on 5-9 February, 2017. The Turkish pavilion will be held at Hall&lt;br /&gt;
9, and will also be the sponsor of the Seasons&amp;rsquo; Lounge at Spring Fair. Should you attend&lt;br /&gt;
Spring Fair, please come and visit the Turkish Housewares Pavilion as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, we would like to give you an update on the exciting work that the&lt;br /&gt;
Turkish housewares and kitchenware sector has been undertaking.&lt;br /&gt;
We organized the first overseas activity under the Development of International&lt;br /&gt;
Competition (UR-GE) project for Turkish housewares sector in Indonesia and Vietnam.&lt;br /&gt;
21 companies from Turkish Housewares UR-GE Project participated in this organization&lt;br /&gt;
which took place on March 20-27, 2016. The project has been organized by Istanbul&lt;br /&gt;
Chemicals and Chemical Products Exporters&amp;rsquo; Association (?KM?B) and Turkish Housewares&lt;br /&gt;
Manufacturers Association(EVS?D).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the second stop in our efforts to enhance the sector&amp;rsquo;s competitiveness, we chose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;France. 29 companies from Turkish Housewares UR-GE Project attended this organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least we travelled to both Peru and Mexico. 19 companies from the UR-GE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;joined this organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this issue we have included a Brand Story about one of the leading companies in Turkey:&lt;br /&gt;
Pa?abah&amp;ccedil;e. You can get an insight on Pa?abah&amp;ccedil;e, that attracts a wide customer base with&lt;br /&gt;
more than 20.000 products that are manually and automatically manufactured.&lt;br /&gt;
Pa?abah&amp;ccedil;e exports its products into 140 countries and 65 percent of their sales are taking&lt;br /&gt;
place in foreign markets outside Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also covered the stories and export activities of Linens, S&amp;rsquo;ra Home, Guestinhouse&lt;br /&gt;
and Arnica. We have interviewed some of the leading design talent in the kitchenware&lt;br /&gt;
sector, namely with Bilge Dilsiz, Derya Kundur, Robin Yayla and Furkan Ayhan. As we learned&lt;br /&gt;
about their stories we also had a chance to take a closer look at their works. Ersin Av?ar, the&lt;br /&gt;
chef of Palomar Bar &amp;amp; Restaurant at the Purl Hotel claimed in his interview that &amp;ldquo;One never&lt;br /&gt;
stops learning in the cooking sector!&amp;rdquo;. As a self-taught cook who later received his formal&lt;br /&gt;
education, Ersin Av?ar told us about his story on how he discovered his interest in cooking.&lt;br /&gt;
For a taste of his cooking, we wanted to share some of his recipes with you.&lt;br /&gt;
We hope to see you next time in our IHHS (International Housewares Association) and Hong&lt;br /&gt;
Kong Houseware Fair issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman of Istanbul Ferrous and Non-Ferrous Metals Exporters&amp;rsquo; Association R?dvan Mert&amp;ouml;z&lt;br /&gt;
