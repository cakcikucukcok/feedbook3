  <title>The Hand is My Sword: A  Karate Handbook - Robert A. Trias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Karate means &quot;empty&amp;#150;hand,&quot; but the one who masters this book will never be empty&amp;#150;handed.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In fact, he will be a master of the ultimate in self&amp;#150;defense, for here are the martial arts fundamentals, the basic katas and techniques as taught by Robert Trias, holder of the eighth degree Black Belt.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These movements and techniques are vividly brought to life by more than six hundred striking illustrations, many of them picturing Master Trias and his aides and pupils. Along with the imposing illustrations are important charts not usually found in martial arts books of this kind. The charts show the fatal and disabling points of the body and the nerve centers&amp;#150;for karate can be a deadly game, and those who practice it must know well the significance of the term &quot;killer karate.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For student and instructor alike, this important manual will open new dimensions, new horizons, and in the give&amp;#150;and&amp;#150;take of life will teach the properly oriented how to give much more than he takes. It will give him a new interest, a new zest for living, with the confidence that he can move mountains. Above all, it will teach him that to master others, he must first learn to master himself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
