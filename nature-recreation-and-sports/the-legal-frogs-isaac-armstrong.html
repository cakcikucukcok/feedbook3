  <title>The Legal Frogs - Isaac Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over 90 percent of West Africa&#39;s rainforests have been destroyed, and many amphibian species are on the verge of extinction. A very proactive ecologist, Gilbert Adum, and his team have been working hard to protect one of the planet&#39;s most endangered animals, the giant squeaker frogs (Arthroleptis krokosua) found in Ghana. Only twenty-eight individuals of this species are known to be existing. This book is a poetic narration of the gory tale of two giant squeaker frogs who happen to be the last of their kind. Listy and Disty were just lucky to have escaped the contamination that had just wiped out their family. But unfortunately, when they thought they had found a new home, an ugly avalanche of misadventures befalls them. Eventually, the frogs are dragged to court to fight for their natural right to life." />
