  <title>Go Father, Go Daughter - Pat Fahy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt; For a large portion of the road racing community, qualifying to run in the Boston Marathon represents a signifi cant achievement. Actually running in the Boston Marathon itself is a thrill that the recreational runner remembers for a lifetime.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;  Go Father, Go Daughter: One Familys Pursuit of The Worlds Greatest Foot Race is the story of a middle-aged man who was inspired by his adult daughter to take up distance running. Together they set a long-term goal of achieving the Boston qualifying standards, and running together in the race. Even though both have strong athletic backgrounds, when the daughter falls twenty-four minutes short of qualifying on her fi rst attempt, it becomes obvious that this goal is not going to be easily achieved.&lt;br&gt;  
&lt;br&gt;  Readers will enjoy this memoir recalling the long journey that eventually led Pat Fahy and his daughter Emmie to Copley Square in Boston on April 20, 2009. Along the way, they drew on the love and support of an extended family that travelled along with them to share their ultimate moment.&lt;br&gt;" />
