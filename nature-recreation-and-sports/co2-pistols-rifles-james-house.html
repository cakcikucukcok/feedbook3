  <title>CO2 Pistols &amp; Rifles - James House</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Current safety trends encourage shooters to opt for guns of less power, especially CO2-powered guns. Several airgun shooters are not required to go through the traditional buying procedures of high-powered pistols and rifles, such as background checks and waiting periods. Plus, companies such as Colt, Smith &amp;amp; Wesson, and Walther manufacture high quality CO2 products that are visually indistinguishable from their traditional firearms.&lt;p&gt;    In this new guide to CO2-powered pistols and rifles, James E. House offers a comprehensive history of CO2 guns, dating back to the 1930s, and a discussion of propulsion, pellets, and sights. Beginning shooters are introduced to the market with a complete analysis on performance and accuracy of currently available products. Airgun enthusiasts are reunited with CO2 classics no longer being manufactured. This book also offers additional sections on target shooting, games, and varmints.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;    Offers a comprehensive history of CO2 pistols and rifles dating back to the 1930s&lt;li&gt;    Includes a categorical review of BB pistols, .177 caliber pistols, .20 and .22 caliber pistols, and rifles&lt;li&gt;    Discover products currently available only on the secondary market&lt;/ul&gt;" />
