  <title>Island: Paintings by Tom Curry - Terry Tempest Williams, Carl Little, Tom Curry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;When artist Tom Curry first moved to Maine, his house overlooked a small, uninhabited island in Eggemoggin Reach. One day, while rowing across to the island, his boyhood fear of water came crashing in on him. So he decided to explore his fear head-on, and began painting the island &amp;ldquo;as a way to delve into my own darkness and seek a way back to the surface.&amp;rdquo; That series of paintings, capturing the island in all lights, weathers, and moods, forms the basis of this book. But the whole is much more than the sum of its parts. These paintings represent an ongoing narrative: &amp;ldquo;island as escape and entrapment, island as longing and memory, island as sanctuary, island as self in a sea of turmoil.&amp;rdquo; The paintings are accompanied by essays by Terry Tempest Williams, exploring Curry&amp;rsquo;s spirit of place, and Carl Little, establishing Curry&amp;rsquo;s art within the field of landscape painting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
