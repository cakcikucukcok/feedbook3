  <title>The Husky Who Ate up the House - Elmon Prier, Sasha Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Husky Who Ate Up the House is the true story of how a Siberian husky puppy came into the lives of a family who had already decided that they didnt want any more dogs to love and care for only to lose them to a degenerative disease. 
The Husky Who Ate Up the House is also the story of a mother whose love for a dog was so great until she thought she would secretly purchase a little puppy without knowledge of his pedigree. 
Like a wolf in sheeps clothing and a little library research, the family acknowledged that Siberian huskies are among the worlds greatest jumpers and diggers. They are a powerful combination of the wolf and malamute developed for sled-pulling. 
As little Khivo grew from a fur ball, he began a destructive and self-destructive odyssey inside his house of serendipity. He chewed up extension cords and gnawed on other household objects. Yet he was great with children. In no time, Khivo was now ninety pounds of strength and power. He had also won the love of the whole family. 
Bishop Rudolph Pringle, a neighbor who walked Khivo, said, I have never seen nothing like this dog. He picks up his leash and brings it to me to walk him. Khivo is the only dog who graduated from obedience school despite missing some weeks of training. 
The Husky Who Ate Up the House may just teach children about unconditional love for even an animal, love, tolerance, patience, obedience, trauma, and happiness. Khivos plight is an example of every dog having his day!" />
