  <title>Jewelry Studio: Silver Wire Fusing - Liz Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Silver jewelry is a classic accessory that never goes out of style. Crafters and jewelry makers will learn to create dazzling silver designs with &lt;i&gt;Jewelry Studio: Silver Wire Fusing&lt;/i&gt;, an all-in-one guide to a no-muss, no-fuss version of silversmithing. Since less equipment is required-fine silver is heated with a torch to fuse it without solder-it is a very cost-effective way to learn basic metalsmithing skills, making it more accessible and affordable for the average crafter. Even the most basic beginner and the most experienced jewelry maker will find silver fusing to be fun, easy to master, and extremely inspiring and addictive. Make stunning projects right on your kitchen table!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liz Jones, a jewelry designer and silver fusing teacher at Fusion Beads in Seattle, Washington, takes the beginner through all the necessary steps in this workshop-in-a book that combines technique-building exercises with great projects, all shown through detailed step-by-step photography. Begin with essential tools and materials and setting up a work space, then move into basic techniques like hammering, tumbling and professional finishing, fusing a ring, and creating basic chain. Once you&#39;ve mastered these foundation skills, it&#39;s time to take it up a notch and learn how to fuse large circles, fuse a bail on heavy wire gauges, fuse with cubic zirconia, work with fine gauges, and understand sizing formulas for rings. Projects include rings, earrings, bracelets, necklaces, and pins, but don&#39;t stop there. Once you&#39;ve learned to use your fuse, you&#39;ll soon have a jewelry box filled with gorgeous handmade silver creations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
