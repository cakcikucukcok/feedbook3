  <title>Insectopedia - The secret world of southern African insects - Erik Holm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Insectopedia uncovers the fascinating and infinitely varied world of insects. It explores their intriguing behaviour and biology - from mating and breeding, metamorphosis and movement to sight, smell, hearing and their adaptations to heat and cold.

Previously published as Insectlopedia of Southern Africa, this fully revised and redesigned edition includes up-to-date information throughout, an expanded ID section, and several hundred new photographs. Sales points: more than 700 photographs, many depicting seldom photographed insect behaviours, clear, easy to read text, and a range of feature and fact boxes that add a lively touch, includes an ID section with photographs and line illustrations, the author is well known for his radio talks on insects." />
