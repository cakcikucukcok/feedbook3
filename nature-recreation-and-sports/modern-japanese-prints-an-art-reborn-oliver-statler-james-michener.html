  <title>Modern Japanese Prints: An Art Reborn - Oliver Statler, James Michener</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Featuring over 100 unique prints, &lt;I&gt;Modern Japanese Prints&lt;/I&gt; is a testament to the continuity of Japanese art and creativity.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;By far the most vitally creative group of artists working in Japan today, modern print-makers are truly international in appeal. Although they owe much of their heritage to the famous ukiyoe techniques of the past, they depart from their forebears in at least two important respects. In the first place, whereas in the ancient ukiyoe tradition a print was the joint production of three men&amp;#151; the artist-designer, the artisan who carved the blocks, and the printer&amp;#151;these modern artists perform all these functions themselves, thus satisfying their demands for individual artistic expression at every step of the creative process. Another distinguishing feature of this artistic school is that its inspiration is derived neither solely from its own Japanese past nor solely from the West.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book carefully traces the history of the modern print movement through detailed discussions of the life and work of twenty-nine of its most noteworthy and representative artists. It describes vicissitudes which the movement has undergone and the high artistic ideals which have motivated its members in spite of public apathy and the hostility of the traditionalists.&lt;/div&gt;" />
