  <title>PAINTING SNAILS - Stephen John Hartley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stephen John Hartley left school having failed all his exams - he didn&amp;#39;t care. He had better things to do. He was guitarist in iconic UK punk band NOTSENSIBLES - they recorded four singles, an album and a John Peel session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The North UK had its own separate punk identify imbued with a DIY ethos - make your own record; publish your own fanzine; start your record label. That DIY ethos, along with a fierce pragmatism and anti-authoritarian view became Hartley&amp;#39;s modus operandi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stumbled into a traditional engineering apprenticeship which taught him the practical skills to be able to design, make and mend. Not wishing to fund the boss&amp;#39;s next luxury car, after finishing his apprenticeship, he hitch-hiked round Europe and met up with some friends who made a living out of busking. Inspired by them, he taught himself classical guitar and spent the next five years as a busker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started a back-room DIY record label and inspired by the Japanese printmakers set up a small traditional letterpress and woodblock print-shop to print his record sleeves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After meeting his future wife, and after some harrowing experiences at the hands of the medical establishment, he developed a secret urge to become a doctor. Against almost impossible odds, he got a medical school place and now works as a senior ER physician in a UK Major Trauma Centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout all this, his over-riding passion has been nature, gardening and the outdoors. One of the most exciting days in his life was when he secured a patch of land to rent on a rugged hillside. Since then he&amp;#39;s been gardening organically using permaculture principles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A eureka moment arrived one late balmy September day on his birthday - he would write a book from birthday to birthday using the annual cycle of the garden as a framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No publisher; no agent; no previous writing experience. If there&amp;#39;s a hard way of doing something, Hartley will find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beneath the veneer of his witty vernacular narrative, there is a deep gentle compassion for his fellow humans. This is a heart-warming tale of unflinching self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finished book is a thing of beauty, drawing on his years of typographic experience. He has abandoned the traditional indent in favour of a full space between paragraphs, giving a feel of light and space. The book is lavishly illustrated with woodcuts and line drawings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
