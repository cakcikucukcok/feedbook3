  <title>The Theory and Practice of Breeding to Type and Its Application to the Breeding of Dogs, Farm Animals, Cage Birds and Other Small Pets - C. Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Theory And Practice Of Breeding To Type - ITS APPLICATION TO THE BREEDING OF DOGS, FARM ANIMALS, CAGE BIRDS AND OTHER SMALL PETS. By C.J. Davies. A VINTAGE DOG BOOKS CLASSIC REPRINT. Originally published in 1928, this scarce early work on breeding to type is both expensive and hard to find in its first edition. VINTAGE DOG BOOKS have republished it, using the original text and photographs, as part of their CLASSIC BREED BOOKS series. The author was a highly respected breeder of his day who states:- &quot;Breeding to type is the business of every farmer and fancier. No matter whether the breeder is dealing with show or merely useful stock, he is always consciously or unconsciously selecting and breeding for certain definite qualities which please his eye or promise to increase the value of the stock in which he is interested.&quot; The book&#39;s one hundred and eight pages consist of ten Comprehensive Chapters including six full page photos. Chapters deal with: Breeding to Type. False Doctrines. Pedigree. Modern Heredity. Mendelism. Establishing a Strain. Inbreeding. Methods of Mating. Colour. Heredity and Disease. Early Maturity. Sterility. Etc. Also included are a Breeders Table and a Table of Breeding Data. Breeding to type comes within the province of a great number of animal and bird fanciers, and is a subject upon which so many erroneous ideas are held. The author successfully attempts within these pages to place before breeders of every class of animal the rules which govern the production of standard types. Many of the earliest dog books, particularly those dating back to the 1900&#39;s and before, are now extremely scarce, and increasingly expensive. VINTAGE DOG BOOKS are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork. Because of the use of original artwork and tables some parts may be difficult to read." />
