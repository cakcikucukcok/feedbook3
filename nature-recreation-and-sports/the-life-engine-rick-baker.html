She&amp;#39;s a world-renowned ethnobotanist, and she&amp;#39;s made it her calling to fulfill her late father&amp;#39;s legacy by bringing a life-altering medication from the Amazon to the general public.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And though he is the last person on earth she wants to trust, when Gentry&amp;#39; is wrongly accused of hacking into a CIA satellite, Wolfe is the only person who&amp;#39;s willing to fight to clear her name.
