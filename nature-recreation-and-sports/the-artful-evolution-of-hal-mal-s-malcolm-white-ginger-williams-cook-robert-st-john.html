  <title>The Artful Evolution of Hal &amp; Mal’s - Malcolm White, Ginger Williams Cook, Robert St. John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Artful Evolution of Hal &amp; Mal&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; is a collaboration between artist Ginger Williams Cook and author Malcolm White about the people, the place, and the history of Hal &amp; Mal&#39;s, an iconic institution in downtown Jackson, Mississippi.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Featuring beautiful watercolor paintings, the book brings together thirty years of family history, live music performances, and cafe society through graphic designs of old photographs, original illustrations, Hal&#39;s legendary recipe cards, and the written word. Opening with a foreword by the renowned author and chef Robert St. John and featuring Ginger&#39;s bold and vibrant look at a place she grew up patronizing, &lt;i&gt;The Artful Evolution of Hal &amp; Mal&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; captures the reflective, quirky voice of one half of the dynamic team known to millions as Hal &amp; Mal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hal &amp; Mal&#39;s was conceived by brothers Hal and Malcolm White. The dream was rooted in a childhood on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, reinforced by years of living and working in New Orleans, and ultimately launched in Jackson in 1985. This gathering place has always been owned and operated by family--now the second and third generations. The multifunctional, southern-soul-soaked rooms are adorned with memorabilia and chock-full of local character; each one also features a stage for live music. The kitchen serves a steady offering of hearty regional staples with a nod toward the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hal &amp; Mal&#39;s is the most-talked-about upscale honky-tonk in all of Mississippi, where art is made, music plays, and folks gather to share community and celebrate the very best of Mississippi&#39;s creative spirit.&lt;/br&gt;" />
