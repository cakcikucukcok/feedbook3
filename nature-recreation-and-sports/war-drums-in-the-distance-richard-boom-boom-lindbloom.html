  <title>War Drums in the Distance - Richard (boom boom) Lindbloom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was told during the 09/10 season that two things were virtually impossible. First the
snowflakes were too fluffy to make a snowman in Fort Collins, Colorado. Secondly, the
Blackhawks could not win the Stanley Cup with their mediocre goaltenders.&lt;p&gt;
As the saying goes, Dont believe everything you hear, and only half of what you get in
writing.&lt;p&gt;
This book is a zany look back at the resurgence of the men that wear the Indian Head on their chest, a resurgence that began in the 07/08 season. In this book youll discover;&lt;p&gt;
Why President Obama desperately needs to watch a hockey game.&lt;br&gt;
 Why so much of Emily Dickinsons poetry is a reflection of what takes place on frozen
pond.&lt;br&gt;
 What the Battle of the Bulge had much in common with the Predator quarterfinals.&lt;br&gt;
The story of fan who momentarily took the violence out of hockey.&lt;br&gt;
The role the classic film, Napoleon Dynamite, played in the 08/09 playoffs.&lt;br&gt;
The incredible sacrifice of 1yr old Callum Birdzell during the Hawks quest for the Cup
(or  why baby needs a new pair of jammies.)&lt;br&gt;
 What the Darryl brothers from the Bob Newhart show had to do with the Hawks greatest comeback ever.&lt;br&gt;
Why the Hawks switched to Queen Pawn Openings-a walk on the wild side!&lt;br&gt;
You know youre hooked by the larceny laced mayhem on the ice when you and your 14 yr
old daughter look knowingly into each others eyes and say, That Columbus game is going to be a big one!&lt;br&gt;
How Capocalypse can be explained by considering James Brown, Zorba the Greek and Mr. Bo Jangles.&lt;br&gt;
Why fans in Chicago are asking the fans in The City of Brotherly Love, can we still be
friends?" />
