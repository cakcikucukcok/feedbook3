  <title>The Shark and the Albatross: A Wildlife Filmmaker Reveals Why Nature Matters to Us All - John Aitchison, Carl Safina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;For twenty years John Aitchison has been traveling the world to film wildlife for a variety of international TV shows, taking him to far-away places on every continent. &lt;I&gt;The Shark and the Albatross&lt;/I&gt; is the story of these journeys of discovery, of his encounters with animals and occasional enterprising individuals in remote and sometimes dangerous places. His destinations include the far north and the far south, from Svalbard, Alaska, the remote Atlantic island of South Georgia, and the Antarctic, to the wild places of India, China, and the United States. In all he finds and describes key moments in the  lives of animals, among them polar bears and penguins, seals and whales, sharks and birds, and wolves and lynxes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;John Aitchison reveals what happens behind the scenes and beyond the camera. He explains the practicalities and challenges of the filming process, and the problems of survival in perilous places. He records touching moments and dramatic incidents, some ending in success, others desperately sad. There are times when a hunted animal triumphs against the odds, and others when, in spite of preparation for every outcome, disaster strikes. And, as the author shows in several incidents that combine nail-biting tension with hair-raising hilarity, disaster can strike for film-makers too.&lt;/div&gt;" />
