  <title>Jags to Riches - John Oehser, Pete Prisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jags to Riches&lt;/i&gt; is the ultimate fan book chronicling the Jacksonville Jaguars&#39; improbable run to the AFC Championship Game and within one game of going to the Super Bowl. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Jags to Riches&lt;/i&gt; Prisco and Oehser of the &lt;i&gt;Florida Times Union&lt;/i&gt; cover the wildly successful 1996 season of Jacksonville&#39;s pro football team, a surprising development because the Jaguars were in only their second year and had compiled a dismal 4-12 record in their first. An expansion team in a city that had sought a pro grid franchise since 1979, its concentration had been on signing young athletes, with the expectation that they would be ready to make a major move in three years. And, although coach and general manager Tom Coughlin had gotten off to a bad start with the team members, he was an important contributor because he judged players solely on their ability and drive and not on their press clippings, according to the authors. In his first year, Coughlin&#39;s coaching reflected more of his college than his pro background: gradually he relaxed many of his rules, and the team was better for it. Most amazing was the record, since, after 11 games, it stood at 4-7; then came five straight wins in the regular season and play-off victories against highly favored Buffalo and Denver.&lt;/p&gt;" />
