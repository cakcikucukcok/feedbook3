  <title>Fear No Distance: A Journey to Life without Limits - Danielle Grabol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During a routine physical in 2004, Danielle Grabol was given an ultimatum: get your act together and lose weight or prepare yourself for a bleak future. Losing her breath while walking up a flight of stairs, Danielle realized that her health was on a downward spiral&amp;hellip;and it was time to make a serious lifestyle change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danielle&amp;rsquo;s journey wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy. After losing nearing 70 pounds via a complete diet overhaul, she discovered her one true passion&amp;mdash;riding bikes. While on a training ride in Panama City Beach, Florida, Danielle was hit by a car and broke her leg. Doctors warned her that her multisport days were likely over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Fear No Distance &lt;/em&gt;Grabol opens up about overcoming her injuries and discovering the world of long-distance triathlon and ultra-cycling racing. Her story is one of incredible grit and determination. From Race Across America to a 281.2-mile double Anvil triathlon, Grabol continued to raise the bar for her racing. Shattering the stereotypes of women in ultra-triathlon, Grabol became the first woman to compete in the EPIC5 triathlon. In five days, she completed five Ironman-distance triathlons, each on a different Hawaiian island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fear No Distance &lt;/em&gt;is a story of becoming comfortable being uncomfortable and will challenge you to dream big and let go of limitations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
