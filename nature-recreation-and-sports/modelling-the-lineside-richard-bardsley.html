  <title>Modelling the Lineside - Richard Bardsley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you want to recreate in realistic model form some of the excitement of watching trains by the lineside - then this is the book for you. It contains several photographs of the available relevant products and includes numerous step-by-step illustrations, with accompanying text, that demonstrate how to build the many features of the lineside, either from kits or from scratch. Moreover, all the various aspects of modelling the lineside are brought together in four layout projects covering typical lineside scenes from the steam era right up to the present. Defines what is meant by the lineside and discusses the design considerations that are necessary to maximize the available lineside modelling space; examines the lineside boundary in terms of the many different types of fencing and walls; considers the various means which people use to cross the line such as level crossings and footbridges; covers the many structures by the lineside such as huts and water towers; explores in detail the use of model figures and road vehicles; discusses signalling and covers signal boxes, types of signals, turnout rodding and concrete trunking; demonstrates how to produce realistic models of numerous miscellaneous lineside features such as signs, telegraph poles, graffiti and rubbish. This is essential reading for all railway modellers who wish to authentically recreate the railway lineside and is beautifully illustrated with 236 colour photographs including step-by-step illustrations and 6 diagrams." />
