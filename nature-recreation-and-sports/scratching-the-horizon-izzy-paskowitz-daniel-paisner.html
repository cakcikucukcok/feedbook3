  <title>Scratching the Horizon - Izzy Paskowitz, Daniel Paisner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A bitchin&#39; love letter to sand and sea, and a spirited inside account of life with the &quot;first family&quot; of American surfing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1956, Dorian &quot;Doc&quot; Paskowitz stepped away from a successful medical practice and began a lifelong surfing odyssey that grew to include his wife Juliette, and their nine children. Together, the Paskowitz clan lived a vagabonding bohemian existence, eschewing material possessions in favor of intangible riches like health and good cheer . . . all the while careening along the world&#39;s coastlines in search of the perfect wave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Scratching the Horizon,&lt;/i&gt; Izzy Paskowitz looks back at his unusual upbringing, and his lifelong passion for the sport that carries his family&#39;s stamp. As the fourth-oldest child in a family of inveterate surfers, rock stars, and beach bums, he is uniquely qualified to shine a light on a childhood that has come to symbolize the surfing credo, a reckless young adulthood that nearly cost him his sanity, and a maturing sense of self and purpose that allows him to lift others on the back of his experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the father of a son with autism and the founder of &quot;Surfers Healing,&quot; a foundation devoted to expanding the horizons of children with autism through surfing, Paskowitz has found a way to connect the surreal aspects of his childhood to the harsh realities of adulthood, and he shares these discoveries in this wickedly entertaining and transforming memoir.&lt;/p&gt;" />
