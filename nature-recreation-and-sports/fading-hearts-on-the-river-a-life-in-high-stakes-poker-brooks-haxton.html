  <title>Fading Hearts on the River: A Life in High-Stakes Poker - Brooks Haxton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Centered around multi-million dollar stakes and a series of nationally televised poker tournaments, &lt;I&gt;Fading Hearts on the River&lt;/I&gt; offers a story of odds&amp;#151;the odds of a newborn surviving severe jaundice, the odds of Congress passing a law that renders one&amp;#8217;s online gambling income inaccessible, the odds of drawing the right card on the turn or the river. In this tale of fatherhood and worldy success, Haxton follows his son Isaac&amp;#8217;s unlikely career as a poker player, the nervous father often sitting on the sidelines with his fingers crossed or staring at a casino monitor while Isaac wins more in one hand of play than Haxton has earned from all his books of poetry combined.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt; In this deftly crafted story Haxton explores the propensity for abstraction, logic, and memory all good poets and poker players share, all the while taking readers on a rollicking tour of complex, intertwined topics, ranging from game theory and financial strategies, to medical mysteries and lost love, to chess, Magic cards, and Texas Hold &amp;#145;em. Guided by the through-line of a father&amp;#8217;s love and admiration for his talented son, &lt;I&gt;Fading Hearts&lt;/I&gt; delivers a unique perspective on professional gambling and one family&amp;#8217;s experience playing the odds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
