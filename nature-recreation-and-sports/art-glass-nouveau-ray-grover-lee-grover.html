  <title>Art Glass Nouveau - Ray Grover, Lee Grover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Art Glass Nouveau&lt;/I&gt; is an exploration of the magnificent beauty of colored glass art.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This art book contains many unique pieces that were produced extensively in the United States, Great Britain, and other European countries during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when this fine art was at its height.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All of the illustrations are in full color. The book contains 424 plates, 50 of which are full page. The complete description of each piece indicates its size, the type of glass used, its identification marks, the names of the designer and/or producer, when known, and its present owner. While every significant type of art glass produced during this period is covered in the succinct text, the exciting galaxy of 424 plates, interspersed throughout the book, were selected not only because of their rare beauty and authenticity, but also to show representative pieces, similar to those that are still obtainable. Most important of all in identifying a piece and determining its value, according to the authors, are its color, its shape, and the texture of its surface, to which they constantly give particular attention.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
