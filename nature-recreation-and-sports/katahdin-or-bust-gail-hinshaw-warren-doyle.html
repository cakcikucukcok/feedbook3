Triple your odds of success by merely selecting the best starting location; it&amp;#39;s not Springer Mountain! (Chapter 10)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Triple your odds of success by completing a particular training program! (Chapter 11)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Reduce your average daily pack weight to less than 6 pounds - including food and water! (Chapter 8)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Select the proper balance of food and nutritional supplements to maximize your energy! (Chapter 16)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Select the best hiking strategy for your personality! (Chapter 9)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. What two beverages you need to drink EVERY TIME you resupply! (Chapter 16)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Why you need to throw away your shoes every 500 miles! (Chapter 12)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. The cheapest way to thru-hike the Appalachian Trail. It&amp;#39;s also the easiest and the most enjoyable.
