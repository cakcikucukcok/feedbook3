      <meta name="description" content="When life, or the spirit of experimentation, or the whim of watercolor itself leads artists outside their comfort zone, conditions are favorable for something new and wonderful to happen. &lt;i&gt;Splash 11: New Directions&lt;/i&gt; features 126 such somethings, representing the best watercolor work being created today. &lt;p&gt;    As intriguing as the paintings themselves, the artists talk about what inspired these new directions - anything from a trip around the world to a bowl of apples passed by a hundred times before. Find out how a workshop, a new brush, or a new perspective (like painting into the sun) injected these works with fresh energy, emotion and inner reflection.&lt;p&gt;    In true &lt;i&gt;Splash&lt;/i&gt; tradition, the sheer diversity of work within is stunning - from thick, dark and dramatic to light, loose and washy ... in some cases all in the same piece. You&#39;ll find work from favorite &lt;i&gt;Splash&lt;/i&gt; watercolorists, along with quite a few new artists never before seen in print. &lt;p&gt;    Anyone who has a passion for art will appreciate the thrill of discovery and freshness of technique that fills these pages. For painters who aspire to keep their own art lives fresh and exciting, this work - and the stories behind it - offer powerful inspiration to change it up, stand in a new place, and paint that painting you think you can&#39;t." />
