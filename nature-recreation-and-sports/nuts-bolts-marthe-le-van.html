  <title>Nuts &amp; Bolts - Marthe Le Van</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&quot;I am not even sure how to describe what a gorgeous book this is! The layout is clean and modern, just like the projects and gallery presented in the book. Each photo showed something new that I had never seen before. The designs are beautiful and unusual and have a wide range of variety and appeal.&quot; &amp;#8212; Atlantic County Library&lt;BR&gt;Those with a taste for modern jewelry, including steampunk fashionistas, will treasure this how-to guide to designing striking ornaments. In keeping with steampunk&#39;s do-it-yourself spirit, this manual shows how to use tubes, rods, metal sheets, and other industrial items to create chic jewelry. Comprehensive instructions for 24 projects include lists of tools and parts as well as illustrated directions for assembly. In addition, a full-color gallery of items by professional jewelry artists offers a wealth of inspiration.&lt;BR&gt;Suitable for jewelry-makers at all levels of experience, the designs include Chain Link Earrings; an Orbit Cuff with coppery discs that appear to float; the Galaxy Necklace, featuring prepunched square metal shapes; and the City Lights Stick Pin, which juxtaposes tubes and guitar strings. Other creative and exciting jewelry designs include brooches, matching sets of necklaces and earrings, rings, and bracelets.&lt;/P&gt;" />
