  <title>Missing Notes, Hidden Talents, and Other Stories - Donald F. Averill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Love and mystery have a way of intertwining in unexpected ways in life. In Donald Averills short story collection, he traces a journey through the lives of vibrant characters driven by love who suddenly find themselves in the midst of intriguing situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Missing Notes, a music department graduate student finds an intriguing composition in an old notebook and begins a search for the author. When she and another student look for a missing notebook, they find themselves implicated in a murder investigation. The Canoe sees retired mathematician and widower Samuel Kelly recalling past experiences involving his family canoe after seeing a canoe for sale. Following the sale of the canoe, Sam and a former girlfriend rekindle an old relationship and get involved in a holdup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Hidden Talents, Clay Coleman, a young physician, misses a turn and arrives at a secluded farm house where he is attacked. Suffering from amnesia, he works his way along Interstate 84 helping people with medical problemswhile his wife searches desperately for him. A seven-year-old boy who thinks he is just living a normal life in 1949 soon realizes that the only way to find out any answers about his grandpas past is to ask good questions in The Pumpkin Tree.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Missing Notes, Hidden Talents, and Other Stories &lt;/em&gt;shares four charming stories with important messages about perseverance, courage, and, most importantly, love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
