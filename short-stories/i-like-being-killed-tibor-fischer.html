  <title>I Like Being Killed - Tibor Fischer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fiendishly funny and dark, here is a &lt;i&gt;Canterbury Tales&lt;/i&gt; for the millennium, a vision of the New Europe where the young and bright live ultra-hip lives of noisy desperation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tibor Fischer has been called &quot;a Joseph Conrad with jokes&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt;, London). Now he earns the title again with a story collection that ranges from the blackest, high-voltage humor  to sober and moving pessimism about the sorry condition of humans at the new millennium. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are those left behind by the vacuous nineties: a failed software designer who cannot connect with others, a failed artist, a failed cowboy, a failed solicitor-seducer, a bookseller primed for failure as he tries to read every book in the world, and a venomous stand-up comedienne who has fallen from grace. From London to the French Riviera, from Hamburg to Romania, in the new Europe only the ruthless succeed: the weak are cowed by the strong, the rich fleece the poor, and the ugly is bested by the surgically enhanced. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reveling in the absurdities of his characters&#39; predicament&#39;s, Fischer rescues them from a relentlessly dark fate. Laced with exuberant narrative and matchless comic invention, &lt;i&gt;I Like Being Killed&lt;/i&gt; reveals the struggle of intelligence to make sense of our twentry-first century world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was also published under the title &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t Read This Book If You&#39;re Stupid&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
