  <title>Wait Till You See Me Dance - Deb Olin Unferth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Deb Olin Unferth&#39;s stories are so smart, fast, full of heart, and distinctive in voice--each an intense little thought-system going out earnestly in search of strange new truths. What an important and exciting talent.&quot;--George Saunders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than ten years, Deb Olin Unferth has been publishing startlingly  askew, wickedly comic, cutting-edge fiction in magazines such as &lt;i&gt;Granta&lt;/i&gt;,&lt;i&gt; Harper&#39;s Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;McSweeney&#39;s&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NOON&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Paris Review&lt;/i&gt;.  Her stories are revered by some of the best American writers of our  day, but until now there has been no stand-alone collection of her short  fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wait Till You See Me Dance &lt;/i&gt;consists of several  extraordinary longer stories as well as a selection of intoxicating very  short stories. In the chilling &quot;The First Full Thought of Her Life,&quot; a  shooter gets in position while a young girl climbs a sand dune. In  &quot;Voltaire Night,&quot; students compete to tell a story about the worst thing  that ever happened to them. In &quot;Stay Where You Are,&quot; two oblivious  travelers in Central America are kidnapped by a gunman they assume to be  an insurgent--but the gunman has his own problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Unferth  story lures you in with a voice that seems amiable and lighthearted, but  it swerves in sudden and surprising ways that reveal, in terrifying  clarity, the rage, despair, and profound mournfulness that have taken up  residence at the heart of the American dream. These stories often take  place in an exaggerated or heightened reality, a quality that is  reminiscent of the work of Donald Barthelme, Lorrie Moore, and George  Saunders, but in Unferth&#39;s unforgettable collection she carves out  territory that is entirely her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
