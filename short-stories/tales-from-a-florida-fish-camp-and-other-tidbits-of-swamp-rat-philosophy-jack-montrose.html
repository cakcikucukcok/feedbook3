  <title>Tales from a Florida Fish Camp: And Other Tidbits of Swamp Rat Philosophy - Jack Montrose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Join Jack Montrose, a fish camp regular since 1965, as he reminisces about the good old days fishing on the St. Johns River. &lt;i&gt;Tales from a Florida Fish Camp&lt;/i&gt; captures the atmosphere and humor of fish camps, where fishermen gathered to tell tall tales of their fishing exploits, play practical jokes, and relax over a cold beer. Here you&#39;ll find tales of more than just fish (though the ones caught were THIS BIG). you&#39;ll encounter snakes, gators, cats (ordinary house ones as well as a panther), turtles, manatees, a skunk, and lots and lots of bugs, as well as a few celebrities--including a baseball manager, a general, and an astronaut. The stars are more often than not the boats, and if the tale&#39;s about an airboat, well, don&#39;t expect the teller to have dry shoes. You&#39;re in for huge belly laughs as you read about fish camp contests, tourists, Yankees, and Flash, the hard-drinking, snake-chasing, spitz/bull-dog mix who was everyone&#39;s best friend. Practical jokes abound at fish camps: the author even got to be sheriff for a day when one of his buddies played a joke on him and some unwitting tourists." />
