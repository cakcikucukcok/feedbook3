  <title>White Dialogues - Bennett Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;With all the brilliance, bravado, and wit of his award-winning debut, &lt;i&gt;A Questionable Shape&lt;/i&gt;, Bennett Sims returns with an equally ambitious and wide-ranging collection of stories.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; A house-sitter alone in a cabin in the woods comes to suspect that the cabin may need to be “unghosted.” A raconteur watches as his life story is rewritten on an episode of &lt;i&gt;This American Life&lt;/i&gt;. And in the collection’s title story, a Hitchcock scholar sitting in on a &lt;i&gt;Vertigo&lt;/i&gt; lecture is gradually driven mad by his own theory of cinema.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In these twelve stories, Sims moves from slow-burn psychological horror to playful comedy, bringing us into the minds of people who are haunted by their environments, obsessions, and doubts. Told in electric, insightful prose, &lt;i&gt;White Dialogues&lt;/i&gt; is a profound exploration of the way we uncover meaning in a complex, and sometimes terrifying, world. It showcases Sims’s rare talent and confirms his reputation as one of the most exciting young writers at work today." />
