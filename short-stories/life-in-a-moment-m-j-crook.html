      <meta name="description" content="Who could guess what could happen in just a small moment of time. A life could be changed or ended. Hope for the future could be quenched. Yet opportunities could also surprisingly arrive in a moment of time. 
How would you feel if you tumbled across the floor, running into your heros feet? What would be your thoughts if you stood at the heavenly gates? Seeing the person of your dreams from your patio, what might you do? Do you know what you truly desire in that right person? Much can happen in the parade of life. Even though you work hard, are you blessed? What would life be like if you lived under the sea? This and more are questions that may be answered in the stories within this book." />
