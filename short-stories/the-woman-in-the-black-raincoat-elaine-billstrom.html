  <title>The Woman in the Black Raincoat - Elaine Billstrom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This is a diverse series of short stories that span a period from the 1940s through to the 1970s. Among them, In Homeless,  a little girls builds a house for herself with  very  rudimentary materials, and comes to grief with the attempt;  a housewife recalls her first memory of snow, which is in short supply in coastal, British Columbia.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In Back to Normal, a  young man returns home  after a long absence, only to learn his father has become a part of a medical experiment.  In Courneys Reunion, a young girl turns to drastic means to reunite her family, torn apart by scandal.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In the title story, Marilyn and George cause curiosity and disdain in their upscale neighborhood.  Pigs rout in their lawn;  goats stand on their roof, plus chickens  are  everywhere  but most baffling is Marilyns choice of dress. Her only apparel is a shabby black raincoat, which she wears at all times in all weather.   A neighbours invitation to her party could lead to some answers!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In Shh,   Jake and Jan experience an abrupt change of life style when they switch their careers, from concert pianist and pediatrician to a joint venture in pyramid selling.   It leads to a startling conclusion.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The  poetry includes The Moonlit Garden.  It was  written when the author was thirteen, and launched her interest in writing by winning a high school poetry contest.  Ad Infinitum was published in The Vancouver Sun when she was nineteen.&lt;/P&gt;" />
