  <title>The Perfect Gift - Geraldine Naughton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Perfect Gift&lt;/i&gt; is the inspiring story of two people with such a deep love for each other that cancer couldn&#39;t separate them. During the four years that Mollie battled cancer, her husband, Larry, was her biggest supporter and caregiver. He was there for her most challenging days and for the happy times when she was in remission. His steadfast love for his wife was a shining beacon to her and to their extended family.&lt;p&gt;
In a sad and unexpected twist of fate, Larry was diagnosed with cancer, but chose to keep his sad news a secret from his wife and family. In doing so, he sacrificed his chance to have any treatment, so that he could continue to take loving care of Mollie as her disease progressed. Because of his selfless sacrifice, Larry passed away while Mollie continued to fight her battle with cancer with the help and support of her family. Larrys strength and determination while caring for Mollie will always be his legacy.&lt;p&gt;
Mollie and Larrys marriage and the loving and supportive relationship that they shared as they battled cancer remains an inspiration." />
