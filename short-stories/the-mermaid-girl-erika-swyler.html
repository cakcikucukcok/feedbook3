  <title>The Mermaid Girl - Erika Swyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From Erika Swyler, author of &lt;i&gt;The Book of Speculation&lt;/i&gt;--one of BuzzFeed&#39;s Best Fiction Books of 2015-- a short story of a mermaid who ran away from the circus, and what happened when she started a life on land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before she was a suburban wife and mother, Paulina Watson was the Mermaid Girl of Carnival Lareille. She traveled everywhere with two boxes: the first with red sequins for the dress she wore as a magician&#39;s assistant, the second with green sequins for her mermaid tail. She&#39;d grown up on wild stories told by wild circus people. Books, she hadn&#39;t had books until she&#39;d found Daniel Watson and stopped moving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first time Daniel saw her, Paulina was floating in a glass tank, suspended in water that sparkled like it was made from night sky. She has settled down now, living in a house on a cliff on Long Island Sound with Daniel and their young family: six-year-old Simon and his baby sister, Enola. But if you steal the magician&#39;s assistant from a carnival, how can you know if she&#39;ll disappear?&lt;/p&gt;" />
