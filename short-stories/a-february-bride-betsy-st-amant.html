  <title>A February Bride - Betsy St. Amant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A year&amp;rsquo;s worth of novellas from twelve inspirational romance authors.

When a Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day wedding brings them back together, she struggles against her family&amp;rsquo;s destructive history. Can Allie ever realize that a marriage is so much more than a wedding dress?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History repeats itself when Allie Andrews escapes the church on her wedding day&amp;mdash;in the same dress passed down for generations and worn by all the women in her family&amp;mdash;women with a long history of failed marriages. Allie loves Marcus but fears she&amp;rsquo;s destined to repeat her family&amp;rsquo;s mistakes. She can&amp;rsquo;t bear to hurt Marcus worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcus Hall never stopped loving Allie and can only think of one reason she left him at the altar&amp;mdash;him. When the two are thrown together for his sister&amp;rsquo;s Valentine&amp;rsquo;s Day wedding, he discovers the truth and realizes their story might be far from over. Can Allie shuck expectation&amp;nbsp;and discover who she is as a bride and in the Bride of Christ?
