  <title>Don&#39;t I Know You? - Marni Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if some of the artists we feel as if we know--Meryl Streep, Neil Young, Bill Murray--turned up in the course of our daily lives? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is what happens to Rose McEwan, an ordinary woman who keeps having strange encounters with famous people. In this engrossing, original novel-in-stories, we follow her life from age 17, when she takes a summer writing course led by a young John Updike, through her first heartbreak (witnessed by Joni Mitchell) on the island of Crete, through her marriage, divorce, and a canoe trip with Taylor Swift, Leonard Cohen and Karl Ove Knausgaard. (Yes, read on.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With wit and insight, Marni Jackson takes a world obsessed with celebrity and turns it on its head. In &lt;i&gt;Don&#39;t I Know You?&lt;/i&gt;, she shows us how fame is just another form of fiction, and how, in the end, the daily dramas of an ordinary woman&#39;s life can be as captivating and poignant as any luminary tell-all.&lt;/p&gt;" />

It tells the story of an average woman whose life intersects with era-defining celebrities at every stage. This happens both in realistic and highly implausible ways and requires the reader to meet the page with a certain level of whimsy and a light-hearted suspension of disbelief.<br /><b><i>Don't I Know You? by Marni Jackson - Goodreads</i></b> | “Where have Marni Jackson’s sassy and sublime stories been all my life? It’s safe to say that after reading Don’t I Know You? I know Bill Murray, Karl Ove Knausgaard, Leonard Cohen, Gwyneth Paltrow, and co. so much better (at least the Bill, Karl, Leonard, and Gloop-mistress of Jackson’s febrile imagination).<br /><b><i>Don't I Know You?: Jackson, Marni: 9781250089793: Amazon ...</i></b> | By Marni Jackson.
