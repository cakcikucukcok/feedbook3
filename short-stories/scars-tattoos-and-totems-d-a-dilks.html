  <title>Scars, Tattoos and Totems - D. A. Dilks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This small collection of writings offers some insight to the author&#39;s mind. The lines between fiction, non-fiction, memoir, free verse, short-short story, and confession blend. There are thoughts and emotions that merge to ask questions that are sometimes answered and, sometimes, not. 
Many authors hide between their words but Dilks shows his life across the details of his stories. In some tales, the characters are his family, in others the environment is his; even more deeply the experiences echo his. This is writing as therapy. This is why the author argues that there is no true fiction; just disguise." />
