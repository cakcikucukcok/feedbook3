Yet when a handsome stranger wanders in one day, she wonders if her very own fairytale is just beginning… Reviews<br /><b><i>A Fairytale Bride - Hope Ramsay</i></b> | A Fairytale Bride is a quick, fast pace, enjoyable romance novella. Usually I am not a huge fan of novellas because there is just not enough time to get sufficient depth to the story for my liking. I must say though that Hope Ramsay has done a good job and I did not feel like the story was lacking in any way.<br /><b><i>A Fairytale Bride by Hope Ramsay - Goodreads</i></b> | A Fairytale Bride is a rather cute little novella featuring a love story about a couple who are both avid readers. As a reader myself I couldn't help but love the setting to this story but there's also a bit of a hitch to the couple's fairy tale when it turns out Jeff is related to the family trying to buy out the store.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>A Fairytale Bride - Hope Ramsay</a> </h3></p><hr/>
