  <title>A Ship of Many Oars - Niraj Srivastava</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A ship of Many Oars is a collection of nine short stories, woven on the tapestry of Indian quirks, delinquent nobility, and galloping suspense! The stories meander over the ghost infested hills of Kumaon, thru the Machiavellian minds of big time robbers and into the ravines of Bundelkhand, where Rani Laxmibai rides with Damodar Rao strapped to her back.
You will get to meet the Nawab of Bilaul celebrating his declining status with his eccentric, but affble friend, Zamindar Biltoo Khan  and march with the 147th Brigade of the British Indian Army into the disease ridden jungles of war time Burma! Justice and Fate are fickle friends, as you shall find in the cells of Fatenpur Central Jail!
This collection is a must have for evenings of leisure... you will keep coming back to the fine and colourful yarns!!
Simple uncomplicated plots  and then, the end hits you  hard. Saurabh Chawla, Author, Blogger, Core Member  Shortizen, Indias most popular literary magazine.
Interesting.... riveting short stories Sanjeev Mathur, Editorial Head, The Book Bakers.
Good concepts.... the writing is engaging. Durgesh Shastri, Author, Curse of Red Soil and Founder, Inkcraft, LLP.
Master story teller.... crisply written.... old world charm, Pawan Kumar Mishra, International Vedic Astrologer, Transpersonal Coach and Author of The Living Hanuman." />
