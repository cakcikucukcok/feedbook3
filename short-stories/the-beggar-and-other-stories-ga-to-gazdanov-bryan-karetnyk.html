  <title>The Beggar and Other Stories - Gaïto Gazdanov, Bryan Karetnyk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Translated for the first time, the best short stories by the &#39;modernist master&#39; Gazdanov, author of &lt;i&gt;The Spectre of Alexander Wolf&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Paris underpass, dirty and dressed in rags, stands a silent beggar. In the evening, he walks the deserted streets; at night, he sleeps in a small, foetid crate. He is poor and he is ill, but, on reflection, he is free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Translated into English for the first time, these six stories by modernist master Gaito Gazdanov draw on his own experiences as an exile in Paris. From the glamorous tale of a political agent setting sail from Marseilles to Constantinople, to a meditation on what it means to have - or to be - a father when a wayward stepmother is introduced, these lyrical stories have it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praised by Maxim Gorky, translated with intelligence and grace by Bryan Karetnyk, &lt;i&gt;The Beggar and Other Stories&lt;/i&gt; shows the writer of &lt;i&gt;The Spectre of Alexander Wolf&lt;/i&gt; at his very best.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaito Gazdanov&lt;/strong&gt; (1903-1971) joined the White Army aged just sixteen and fought in the Russian Civil War. Exiled in Paris from the 1920s onwards, he eventually became a nocturnal taxi-driver and quickly gained prominence on the literary scene as a novelist, essayist, critic and short-story writer, and was greatly admired by Maxim Gorky, among others. Pushkin Press also publishes the celebrated &lt;i&gt;The Spectre of Alexander Wolf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Buddha&#39;s Return&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Flight&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
