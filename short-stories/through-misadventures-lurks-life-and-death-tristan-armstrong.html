  <title>Through Misadventures Lurks Life and Death - Tristan Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Within a world full of challenges, Tristan Armstrong shares ten stories that highlight a wide range of characters who must face all that life throws their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Richard Wellingham is assigned to a pretentious little man who contrives to overthrow the reigning kabaka, Sir Edward Mutessa II, an unanticipated accident changes everything. Jason is an artist who thinks his latest painting is coming along nicely, until a series of bizarre events begin occurring. In a village just outside Nairobi, Kenya, Brother Michael enters a dilapidated prison. What no one knows is that he plans to kill in order to free a wrongly accused priest and that his journey has just begun. It is 1912 as detective Oliver Livermoors ship departs New York Harbor, on assignment for Interpol. When a beautiful woman knocks on his cabin door, Oliver soon discovers that her existence is even more mysterious than he ever believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an entertaining collection of short stories, characters from the past and present confront a myriad of challenges as life tests their character, spirit, and perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
