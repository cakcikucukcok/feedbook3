  <title>Children of Vallejo - C.W. Spooner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For nearly all of its existence, Vallejo was a blue collar, lunch pail city where the destinies of the town and its shipyard were inextricably linked. In his first collection of short stories, C.W. Spooner tracks the lives of a handful of characters as they grow from childhood to adolescence and beyond in a hard place where everyone fought to keep what was theirs and children created their own adventures.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Spooner begins with the tale of Nicholas, a terrified four-year-old who is ready to start his first day of nursery school. Nicholas knows he must adhere to his fathers advice to always be a good sailor, but when the first day does not go as planned, Nicholas discovers the true meaning of friendship. Fourteen-year-old Nicks dog, George, has gone AWOL. But just when he is ready to give up, hope arrives. When Carols past shows up at her door with wild hair and a Walt Whitman beard, she is thrilled. His war is finally ending, but it is the gift he leaves with her that finally gives her peace.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This compilation of short tales shares a compelling glimpse into what it was like to grow up in a shipyard town during an uncertain time when no one took life for granted.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These stories  will touch your life no matter where you are from.&lt;/P&gt;
