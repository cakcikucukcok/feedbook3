  <title>Sarah&#39;s Story - Terry Dunn, Alvin Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seven year old Sarah Martin kept secrets to herself, never telling her mother. When her father received a letter from his brother to come and live at his house in Sunnyvale, Vermont, she didn&#39;t want to go. She had a bad feeling about the move. That night as she got ready for bed, her father came to tuck her in, but as he bent down to kiss her goodnight, she pulled away, afraid of him. She&#39;d seen a dark shadow in her dreams, thought it was her father. She was terrified of him. He was furious and told her he was her father and could give her a kiss anytime he wished. She would not let her father hurt her or her mother again as he had before and Sarah would make sure that all men pay for what they did." />
