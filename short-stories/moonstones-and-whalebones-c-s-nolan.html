  <title>Moonstones and Whalebones - C.S. Nolan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The moonstones and the whalebones of Moonstone Beach swirl at the center of many local legends and myths, and as many warnings. Once known as the Travelers Stone, the moonstone was a rare and treasured amulet said to guard against the many perils of travel. Only found in a handful of locations in the world, the people of Moonstone Island, just off Californias southern coast, were so accustomed to seeing them that many had forgotten the stones magical protective powersand the cost of that protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ignorance is anything but bliss for the islanders, who do not know just how close they are to disaster. Those who have heard of the legend either write it off as a fairy tale or shamelessly exploit it for profit. Their fate lies in the hands of one bold and determined boy named Daniel. Just fourteen, his life is about to be pulled into an unimaginable quest to save the lives of everyone he knows and loves. Old Man Drake Clark is seen as a mostly harmless, potentially crazy, and unquestionably eccentric octogenarian, but Daniel knows that his old friend is privy to important knowledge. When he informs Daniel of his role in the legend, the teen must summon the courage to face his destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniel, his father Vincent, and his loyal Dalmatian Ernie set off on an epic quest filled with arduous challenges. If they succeed, they will fulfill the legend of the moonstones and restore peace and safety to their beloved island.&lt;/p&gt;" />
