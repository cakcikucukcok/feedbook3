  <title>A Nation in Flames - Nick Armbrister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is Nick Armbrister&#39;s first collection of short stories, written from the late 90&#39;s to the present day. They cover several topics, like his poems, but in much more depth-from satanic actions by people worshipping an evil god (&#39;Loss of the Ice Queen&#39;) to warriors of the sky using man&#39;s most powerful weapons in anger (&#39;Final Flight&#39;), to an attempt to control fate (&#39;Spell to Find Amelia Earhart&#39;), and to a post-nuclear townscape (&#39;Second History&#39;, set in Oldham).&lt;/p&gt;
Two of the stories are fragments of larger uncompleted/lost work that deserve inclusion here. One day these projects may well see the light of day, but for now, the author hopes the reader will enjoy his &#39;dark work&#39;-in time he hopes to do a follow-up. These stories span his entire writing career. Though he prefers poetry as a means of incisive, concentrated power of expression, he loves short stories for their fun; even those that give one a glimpse into the dark side that lurks beneath the surface of life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
