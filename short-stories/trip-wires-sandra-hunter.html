  <title>Trip Wires - Sandra Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;bull; Current events, in particular climate change underpinning food and water shortage and shrinking livable land for humans, are creating unprecedented conflict, war, displacement, and mass migration of humans. This collection personalizes global-scale catastrophe by taking brief looks into the everyday lives of young people in various regions of the world. 
&amp;bull; Gives readers a sense of what it means to deprive people of peace and resources and even their families.
&amp;bull; Author is Southeast Asian and British. While living in Kenya, she realized that though she&#39;d been born in Britain, she did not feel British. &quot;I didn&#39;t feel as though I came from anywhere. Exploring the feeling of being between cultures and identities?and understanding that it is shared with many people?has been the underpinning for many of the short stories I write.&quot;
&amp;bull; This is the author&#39;s way to &quot;maintain a discussion about inhumanity and its effects, especially on children.&quot;
&amp;bull; Contextualizes the horror of war and displacement, and the struggles of young people in particular to maintain relationships and any sense of control in their lives." />
