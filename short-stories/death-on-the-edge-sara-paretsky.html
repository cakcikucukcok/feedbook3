  <title>Death on the Edge - Sara Paretsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In this short story from &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; bestselling author Sara Paretsky, acclaimed detective V.I. Warshawski must confront gun violence in her own Chicago hometown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legendary sleuth V.I. Warshawski is no stranger to the sound of bullets. Growing up in the Windy City, it was a way of life: loved ones taken too early, gangs patrolling the streets by night, police too quick to touch a trigger. Now, in the wake of a string of high school shootings across the United States, V.I.&amp;#8217;s hometown has become impassioned by the growing movement to tackle gun violence. News reaches her old high school on Chicago&amp;#8217;s South Side that an essay competition spearheaded by renowned newspaper &lt;em&gt;The Edge&lt;/em&gt; is calling for high school students to write about how gun violence has affected their young lives. Overseeing the contest is Marcena Love, a British journalist V.I. has tangled with in the past. But when disputes arise over the poignant and divisive winning essay, violence strikes Mirabel High. To protect the students and teachers, and reveal a killer in their midst, V.I. must employ all her skills as a detective, as well as delve into the darkest moments of her childhood, to solve this deeply personal case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hailed by P.D. James as &amp;#8220;the most remarkable&amp;#8221; of modern crime writers, Sara Paretsky is the&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of&amp;#160;twenty-one novels, including the renowned V.I. Warshawski series. She is one of only three living writers&amp;#8212;alongside John Le Carr&amp;#233; and Lawrence Block&amp;#8212;to have received both the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America and the Cartier Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers Association of Great Britain.
