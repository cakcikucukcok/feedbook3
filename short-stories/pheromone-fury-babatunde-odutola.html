Tanwa didn&amp;rsquo;t like the banker who was drawn to her by the magic. Eventually she discarded the portion, frustrated with the whole magic stuff.

The following afternoon, she decided to have lunch outside, even though she never liked the idea and had food at home. She ran into her father, who was being driven to a business lunch, and joining them, weird stuff erupted, and she found her true love." />
