  <title>Rocky Mountain Watershed - Bill Burch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a secluded Rocky Mountain watershed, gathering rivulets of melting ice form from snow-capped peaks. They launch slowly down headwater creeks, meander through plush beaver meadows, and catapult between deep canyon walls, slowed only momentarily by a large reservoir. They then race through the white-water rapids of Devils Gulp and eventually intersect Towne, a remote mountain community. 
Within this community lives a host of people with a variety of successes, failures, loves, ambitions, obsessions, hopes, and fears. Theres Laura Menard, who left Wisconsin looking for a job but finds only fishing. When her car breaks down near Maggies Corner, Laura discovers that people do care. Theres former Wall Street broker Richard Whendelstat, who gave up the fast pace of life to open the Flies and Lies fishing resort. And then theres Bradley Hawkins, who came to the area on a fishing trip and never left; his wife now wants a divorce.
With wry humor, joy for life, and an immense appreciation of the mountains and small-town living, &lt;i&gt;Rocky Mountain Watershed&lt;/i&gt; narrates the stories of these characters, who face personal decisions that will change their lives and those around themas well as affecting the common thread that binds them all, the river." />
