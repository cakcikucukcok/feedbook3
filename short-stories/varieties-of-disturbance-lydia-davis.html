  <title>Varieties of Disturbance - Lydia Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lydia Davis has been called &quot;one of the quiet giants in the world of American fiction&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/i&gt;), &quot;an American virtuoso of the short story form&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Salon&lt;/i&gt;), an innovator who attempts &quot;to remake the model of the modern short story&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;). Her admirers include Grace Paley, Jonathan Franzen, and Zadie Smith; as &lt;i&gt;Time &lt;/i&gt;magazine observed, her stories are &quot;moving . . . and somehow inevitable, as if she has written what we were all on the verge of thinking.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Varieties of Disturbance&lt;/i&gt;, her fourth collection, Davis extends her reach as never before in stories that take every form from sociological studies to concise poems. Her subjects include the five senses, fourth-graders, good taste, and tropical storms. She offers a reinterpretation of insomnia and re-creates the ordeals of Kafka in the kitchen. She questions the lengths to which one should go to save the life of a caterpillar, proposes a clear account of the sexual act, rides the bus, probes the limits of marital fidelity, and unlocks the secret to a long and happy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No two of these fictions are alike. And yet in each, Davis rearranges our view of the world by looking beyond our preconceptions to a bizarre truth, a source of delight and surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Varieties of Disturbance&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
