  <title>Mom&#39;s Old Testament Bible Stories - Shirley Fillmore Ness</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Build a boat in a desert?
 Do What?  Go where? Not me, God!
Why would a frightened king let a teenager fight a giant?
Strong enough to bench press 1000 pounds!
Why not compromise?  Who needs a den of lions or a fiery furnace?
So nasty, even a fish spits him out!
 Do you know your Bible heroes?
Do your kids know these heroes worth following, and the scoundrels to avoid?
This book has stories from the Bible about heroes from our culture, and a few scoundrels.
These are stories that I taught to my kids while they were growing up. I read them in the Bible, then told them while we were doing dishes.
I think telling them is much better than just reading them to kids. It means more. It says that mom or dad actually know and believe what they are telling.
It imprints a childs mind to hear stories of heroes who dared to stand for God in spite of temptations to give in. That is what makes a hero." />
