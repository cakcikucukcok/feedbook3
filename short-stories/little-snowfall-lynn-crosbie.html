  <title>Little Snowfall - Lynn Crosbie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Little Snowfall&quot; is a short story about a beautiful, young woman named Pixie, who suspects her new neighbour is James Franco. The problem is that her neighbour says his name is Edward and denies he is the famous actor/artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixie has a monstrous crush on James Franco and is sure that Edward is lying about his true identity. After hearing him say his stay is only temporary, she gives herself two weeks &amp;#8212; by Valentine&#39;s Day &amp;#8212; to make him fall in love with her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixie quickly befriends and seduces the man who denies he&amp;#8217;s James Franco. But Pixie has secrets of her own that soon threaten to derail their budding relationship before it even has a chance to begin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What unfolds is a sweet, comical romance between two illusionists that culminates in a dramatic confrontation at a major art show on Valentine&amp;#8217;s Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written as a teaser for Lynn Crosbie&amp;#8217;s new novel about Kurt Cobain, &lt;em&gt;Where Did You Sleep Last Night?&lt;/em&gt;, &quot;Little Snowfall&quot; is fun and romantic nod to the hugely popular fan fiction genre.&lt;/p&gt;" />
