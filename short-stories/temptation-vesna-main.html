      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Variations and fugue on the theme of obsession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vesna Main disturbs our self-image as educated, reasonable and ironic people who read modernist fiction. She disturbs us because we recognise ourselves in her obsessive and bloody-minded characters as they are pushed to the extreme. But they are only too human and seek love, just like us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a collection of twenty short stories of different lengths and written in a variety of styles. Main writes about characters whose passion borders on obsession and who are seeking love and companionship but are doomed to remain alone, with their sense of personal failure as the only company.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Praise for Previous Work ‘Vesna Main’s novel is inventive, witty, “experimental” in style and structure, but none the less involving and powerful for that.<br /><b><i>Temptation: A User’s Guide, Vesna Main - Salt</i></b> | Vesna Main’s experimentation with prose form and a cast of disquieting characters and situations might not suit a reader who is not ready to be challenged. But this collection is worth absorbing and contemplating because she is very skilled in making you, the reader, see the world is a place in which an individual has to work very hard to successfully steer their way through it.<br /><b><i>Temptation.
