  <title>Cat O&#39; Nine Tales - Jeffrey Archer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cat o&#39;Nine Tales&lt;/i&gt; is the fifth collection of irresistible short stories from the master storyteller. Ingeniously plotted, with richly drawn characters and Jeffrey Archer&#39;s trademark of deliciously unexpected conclusions, this new collection has the added bonus of thirteen charming illustrations by the internationally acclaimed artist Ronald Searle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of these twelve stories were inspired by the two years Jeffrey Archer spent in prison, including the story of a company chairman who tries to poison his wife while on a trip to St. Petersburg---with unexpected consequences. &quot;The Red King&quot; is a tale about a con man who discovers that an English lord requires one more chess piece to complete a set that would be worth a fortune. In another tale of deception, &quot;The Commissioner,&quot; a Bombay con artist ends up in the morgue after he uses the police chief as bait in his latest scam. &quot;The Perfect Murder&quot; reveals how a convict manages to remove an old enemy while he&#39;s locked up in jail, and then set up two prison officers as his alibi. In &quot;Charity Begins at Home,&quot; an accountant realizes he has achieved nothing in his life, and sets out to make a fortune before he retires. And then there is Archer&#39;s favorite, &quot;In the Eye of the Beholder,&quot; in which a handsome star athlete falls in love with a three-hundred-pound woman . . . who happens to be the ninth-richest woman in Italy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Archer is the only author to have topped international bestseller lists with his fiction, nonfiction, and short stories. &lt;i&gt;Cat o&#39;Nine Tales&lt;/i&gt; is Archer at his best: witty, poignant, sad, surprising, and unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
