  <title>Memories for Sale - John F. Gardiner, Rebecca Gardiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a young man, John Gardiner scrawled his thoughts on his bedroom windowsill. Now in Memories for Sale, Gardiner shares short stories, poems, and a novella that he hopes will provide inspiration for others to look inward and reflect on the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gardiner, a former newspaper editor, believes that we are all intelligent enough to solve our own problems. With that theory in mind, he offers writings that attempt to unravel the meaning of life and encourage deep thinking. In his varied collection shared with fluid realism, Gardiner explores relatable topics such as the aging process, loneliness, and suffering and pain as well as chronicles the life of a character named Gawd by his abusive alcoholic father. Through his emotional thoughtscapes, Gardiner offers a creative foundation for others to contemplate the future of humanity and their own destinies.&lt;/p&gt;
