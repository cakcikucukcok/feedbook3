  <title>Smut - Alan Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One of England&#39;s finest and most loved writers explores the uncomfortable and tragicomic gap between people&#39;s public appearance and their private desires in two tender and surprising stories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Greening of Mrs. Donaldson,&lt;/i&gt; a recently bereaved widow finds interesting ways to supplement her income by performing as a patient for medical students, and renting out her spare room. Quiet, middle-class, and middle-aged, Mrs. Donaldson will soon discover that she rather enjoys role-play at the hospital, and the irregular and startling entertainment provided by her tenants. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In&lt;i&gt; The Shielding of Mrs. Forbes,&lt;/i&gt; a disappointed middle-aged mother dotes on her only son, Graham, who believes he must shield her from the truth. As Graham&#39;s double life becomes increasingly complicated, we realize how little he understands, not only of his own desires but also those of his mother. &lt;br&gt;A master storyteller dissects a very English form of secrecy with two stories of the unexpected in otherwise apparently ordinary lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
