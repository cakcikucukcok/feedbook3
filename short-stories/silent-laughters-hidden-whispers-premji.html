  <title>Silent Laughters, Hidden Whispers - Premji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Silent Laughters, Hidden Whispers is a wonderful collection of short stories which gives a true understanding of the contemporary human psyche. It shows life as it is and makes us reflect on life as it should be. Premji has used the medium to bring out the angst in his soul, the fire to cleanse society and make better humans out of beings. Every story from this collection is captivating mainly because of his unique and inimitable style, where he is a part of every tale and weaves it around him; he takes us on a journey where we meet people, situations, and daily events seemingly so ordinary turn extraordinary, like water to wine, when told as a story by him. Many of the stories act to remind us of how true inner happiness is the only way to bring happiness into the life of those around us. Each story lifts a veil and lets us see life with a more clear vision. The author has a moral, a lesson or at least a thought for everyone at the end of his stories; they never fail to shake us out of our ideal, impassioned reverie." />
