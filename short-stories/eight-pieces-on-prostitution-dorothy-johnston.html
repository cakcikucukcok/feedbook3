  <title>Eight Pieces on Prostitution - Dorothy Johnston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The stories in Eight Pieces on Prostitution span the whole of my writing life and include my first published story, &#39;The Man Who Liked to Come with the News&#39;, which Frank Moorhouse chose for his 1983 anthology, &#39;The State of the Art&#39;. My first novel, &#39;Tunnel Vision&#39;, is set in a Melbourne massage parlour, and I have continued to return to the theme of prostitution in my novels and short stories, notably in &#39;The House at Number 10&#39; and in this collection. &#39;Where the Ladders Start&#39; is a long story, almost a novella, based around a suspicious death. Many of the stories are set in Canberra, Australia&#39;s national capital, where I lived for thirty years before returning to Victoria&#39;s Bellarine Peninsula.  The cover design is based on a painting by Bartolome Esteban Murillo called &#39;Two Women at a Window&#39;, which is held at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. Though the women in the painting are probably prostitutes, it is not absolutely clear; there&#39;s an ambiguity about them, as well as an amused self-awareness. I like this very much and feel that it suits my stories.&quot; - Dorothy Johnstondorothyjohnston.com.au" />
