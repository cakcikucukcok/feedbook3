Leftys Ghost must have done it.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Is there a place between Heaven and Hell, where we must somehow redeem or condemn ourselves? Wouldnt that be confusing? My Brother, My Haunting will make you laugh, but it will also make you wonder.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Will there be human-appearing cyborgs in the future? Can you imagine two cyborgs meeting, each believing the other to be human?
