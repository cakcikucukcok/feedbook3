  <title>Father Brown: Essential Tales - G. K. Chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gilbert Keith Chesterton was an English writer who lived at the turn of the 20th century. His works explored a number of subjects such as philosophy, poetry, journalism, lectures, criticism, and theatrical plays. However, his best-known stories feature the character of an English priest and detective named Father Brown. While the character was based on a real priest who was involved in Chesterton&#39;s own conversion of faith, the adventures and mysteries that Father Brown solves are purely fictional. Included in the collection &quot;Father Brown: Essential Tales&quot; are &quot;The Blue Cross,&quot; &quot;The Invisible Man,&quot; &quot;The Strange Crime of John Boulnois,&quot; and twelve other thrilling stories. What is interesting about Father Brown is that he does not rely on deductive reasoning like other famous detectives, namely Sherlock Holmes. Instead, Father Brown relies on intuition. He puts himself into the mind of the perpetrator and figures out the criminal&#39;s steps along the way. Part of what makes him a great detective is that Father Brown is never shocked by the atrocities that he sees. As a priest, he says that he has already heard about all the awful things people do and think; nothing surprises him anymore. He also refuses to believe in any supernatural explanations and instead focuses on a case&#39;s reasonable explanation. Anyone wanting a fun and entertaining read with a great character to lead the way should add &quot;Father Brown: Essential Tales&quot; to their reading list." />
