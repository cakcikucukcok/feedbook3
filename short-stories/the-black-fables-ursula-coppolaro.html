  <title>The Black Fables - Ursula Coppolaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Black Fables&quot; is the first collection of short stories by Ursula Coppolaro.
As can be deduced from the title, the correct term would probably be &quot;fable&quot; instead of stories. Because this is Ursula in His narration always inserts a moral background, characteristic of the genre of the Fable.
This collection shows us how it is possible, even in 2014, revisit, correct and expand a genre That is deepened since the time of Aesop and Phaedrus, but as it is Also possible to add something new: a bit of macabre and noir.
Phaedrus Already teaches us That the story is not always a happy ending, and not always win heros.
Ursula Often stays halfway between a pessimistic and an optimistic, showing worlds with dark gray shades.
Characterized by a slender, essential style, the prose of Ursula is accessible to all, but not unfluent, or less suited to convey a concept That is Often Overlooked in the modern world: a moral That lesson can be drawn from experience, Whether it be literary or real life.
