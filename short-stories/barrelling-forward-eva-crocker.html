  <title>Barrelling Forward - Eva Crocker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner, Canadian Authors Emerging Writer Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalist, Dayne Ogilvie Prize for LGBTQ Emerging Writers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shortlisted for the NLCU Fresh Fish Award for Emerging Writers, &lt;em&gt;Barrelling Forward&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliantly crafted debut collection from Newfoundland&amp;#8217;s newest literary star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eva Crocker sees life in sharper focus than the rest of us. The objects, rituals, and scenes of everyday life take on an almost mythic quality in these stories, even while remaining intimately recognizable to us all. Crocker peers at the underbelly of poverty and work, ambition and apathy, loneliness and love, to find the sliver of beauty in each spot. Nothing is ever as simple as it seems: the boundaries between friendship and sex dissolve; power relationships are turned on their heads, if only long enough to examine them from all angles; transgressions and escapes become new kinds of traps. In &amp;#8220;Auditioning,&amp;#8221; a young twin makes a desperate attempt to reclaim her individuality. In &amp;#8220;Serving,&amp;#8221; a father and a son give parallel accounts of what it looks like when you let life eat you from the inside out. In &amp;#8220;Star of the Sea,&amp;#8221; a man watches his past get literally torn down before his eyes. And in the Cuffer Prize&amp;#8722;winning &amp;#8220;Dead Skin,&amp;#8221; an after-school walk through the barrens leaves two boys forever changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In stories that ache with longing even as they pulse with new possibilities, Crocker gives us an unforgettable array of ordinary people, sometimes soaring, sometimes sinking, but always, ultimately, barrelling forward towards what&amp;#8217;s next. Vivid, sexy, funny, and raw, this is a marvel of a debut from one of Canada&amp;#8217;s most thrilling new writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
