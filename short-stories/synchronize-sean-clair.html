  <title>Synchronize - Sean Clair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The new century saw a furthering of violence hinged in some bizarre way to organized religion, religions that were centuries old and born of good will toward man. Within months of the terror attacks ultimately linked to Bin Laden and his platter.  The initial shock, horror, revulsion and sorrow was now replaced with vengeance served up big-time and brought to you nightly by CNN or whoever had the best feed.  The far reaching effects trickled down into the communities we lived in.  Surprise anthrax packages, remember Tom Brokaw&#39;s little gift at the network home site?  The attacks continue today with assaults at Fort Hood attributed to a madman, English transit, in Spain and everyday something new.  The recent Shafia trial in Kingston Ontario was blocks from our fictitious setting, imagine...
The setting is ever changing in this thriller set between Ontario prisons and the fluid world of terrorists who maneuver their agenda with well laid out plans that cover several months or more of planning.  We&#39;ve grown somewhat callous perhaps to the daily bombings and activities of the Middle East.  Picture some of the same events in our own towns and communities, the scope of the 911 attacks on a smaller scale, but with potential to devastate lives.  A must read" />
