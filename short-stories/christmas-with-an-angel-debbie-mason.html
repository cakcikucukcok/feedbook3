  <title>Christmas with an Angel - Debbie Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s been eight long years since Michael Gallagher has laid eyes on Shay Angel, back when he was a boy from the most prominent family in town and she was a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. But he hadn&#39;t cared about their differences - until one bad decision landed her in jail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That was years ago and now he&#39;s back in Harmony Harbor for the holidays. So when Shay goes missing, Michael is intent on finding her &lt;b&gt;- &lt;/b&gt;and finding out if their sizzling attraction is still there. But he&#39;s now a district attorney, and it looks like Shay is once again on the wrong side of the law. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
