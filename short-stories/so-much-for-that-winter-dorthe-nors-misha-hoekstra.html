  <title>So Much for That Winter - Dorthe Nors, Misha Hoekstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dorthe Nors follows up her acclaimed story collection &lt;i&gt;Karate &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chop&lt;/i&gt;  with a pair of novellas that playfully chart the aftermath of two very  twenty-first-century romances. In &quot;Days,&quot; a woman in her late thirties  records her life in a series of lists, giving shape to the tumult of her  days--one moment she is eating an apple, the next she is on the floor,  howling like a dog. As the details accumulate, we experience with her  the full range of emotions: anger, loneliness, regret, pain, and also  joy, as the lists become a way to understand, connect to, and rebuild  her life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &quot;Minna Needs Rehearsal Space,&quot; a novella  told in headlines, an avant-garde musician is dumped via text  message. Fleeing the indignity of the breakup and friends who flaunt  their achievements in life, career, and family, Minna unfriends people  on Facebook, listens to Bach, and reads Ingmar Bergman, then decamps to an  island near Sweden, &quot;well suited to mental catharsis.&quot; A cheeky nod to  the listicles and bulletins we scroll through on a daily basis, &lt;i&gt;So Much for That Winter&lt;/i&gt;  explores how we shape and understand experience, and the disconnection  and dislocation that define our twenty-first-century lives, with Nors&#39;s  unique wit and humor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
