  <title>Mehbub Gulley - Elizabeth Kottarem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mehbub Gulley  Short Stories from India  is an anthology of stories about the  lives of ordinary men and women in  India, their existential dilemmas and  their angst. Some of the stories  are about  life in the civil service.  
What happens when poor and studious Samuel  from  Alleppey gets selected to the Indian Administrative Service and  marries into  a wealthy landowning family?  Nilufer longs to live with Pirosh in a house of her own in Darius Baug colony  but as she pursues her dream, it takes the quality of a nightmare.  Stefan,  a young Austrian tourist finds  himself succumbing to the  enticements of Hyderabadi Biryani and  a dimpled brown nymph, under the shadows of the Charminar in Hyderabad.  The PMs plan to floor the foe across the border in Humptidumptistan with a powerful  Stink Bum is stymied by the rivalry between  Pisspot, the  autocratic head of administration and the Old Codger, the irascible  Chairman of the Sindustan Science Commission. Shiva Shambo, the Deputy Secretary is caught in the middle of the muddle.
Narrated with sympathy, often with  humour,  the stories are sharply  etched cameos of life in India, drawn by Elizabeth Kottarems firm brush strokes." />
