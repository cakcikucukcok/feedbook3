      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Death in Three Quarter Time&lt;/i&gt; is an eclectic collection of original short stories.  By expressing life&#39;s true meaning through the written word, these stories deal with conflict and times of grief that will surely bring insight and understanding into the reader&#39;s life.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sioux Dallas, a widow, is a retired high school coach and classroom teacher as well as a retired horse trainer and riding instructor. Her columns on sporting events and training horse and rider appeared for thirty-two years in five newspapers around Washington D.C. and later in Zephyrhills, Florida.

She teaches square dancing on horseback (the horses do the dancing) and is a water aerobics instructor for a nationally known gym. Sioux has been a Bible teacher for many years. She has had short stories and poems published. &lt;br&gt;In the late 1950s and early &#39;60s, Sioux taught blind and mentally challenged children, free of charge on her own horses and while she was teaching public school. She was invited to attend a brunch meeting in the Red Fox Inn in Middlesboro, Virginia to discuss open riding schools for the handicapped in the United States. &lt;br&gt;Sioux is a past Organizing Regent for the DAR, Past President for the UDC, past High Priestess of the Ladies&#39; Oriental Shrine of North America, member of the Seventeenth Century Colonial Dames, a bagpipe playing member and Secretary of the Gulf Coast Pipe and Drum Corps who marched in parades and played for many social events, organizer and leader of the Bit and Bridle 4-H Club where she taught riding, correct care of equines, correct showing, stable care and taught the teens to be horse show judges. &lt;br&gt;Sioux and her husband retired to Florida where she organized and led the only recognized riding club in Florida.
