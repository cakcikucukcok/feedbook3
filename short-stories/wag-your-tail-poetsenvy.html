  <title>Wag Your Tail - poetsenvy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Dogs change our worlds by giving unconditional love and sharing our lives. In these stories dogs have identi ties and personalities. They are more than companions and friends. They are actors playing center stage, entering our minds and hearts and becoming unforgettable.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each dog owner discovers that a dog becomes part of the family history, part of the stories told around the table, and sometimes the only thing that touches our emotions. During a dogs lifeti me a dog finds ways to entertain, dismay, or love the humans around them. A dog cant be ignored.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Perhaps dogs are highly regarded because they dont have hidden motives. They love you or dislike you. Life is that simple. Once their decision is made they dont forget their friends or enemies.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In my opinion most dogs are angels sent to bring unconditi onal love into the world and to battle the dark forces. As you read these stories decide for yourself if dogs change our lives for the better. You may have known dogs like Belle that can do so many things. Read and enjoy and let the dogs entertain you.&lt;/P&gt;" />
