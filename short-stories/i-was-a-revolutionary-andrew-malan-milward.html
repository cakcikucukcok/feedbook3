  <title>I Was a Revolutionary - Andrew Malan Milward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A richly textured, diverse collection of stories that illuminate the heartland and America itself, exploring questions of history, race, and identity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grounded in place, spanning the Civil War to the present day, the stories in &lt;em&gt;I Was a Revolutionary&lt;/em&gt; capture the roil of history through the eyes of an unforgettable cast of characters: the visionaries and dreamers, radical farmers and socialist journalists, quack doctors and protestors who haunt the past and present landscape of the state of Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these stories&amp;#8212;which have appeared in &lt;em&gt;Zoetrope All-Story, The Best New American Voices, FiveChapters, Story, American Short Fiction&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ninth Letter&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;the award-winning writer Andrew Malan Milward crafts an epic mosaic of the American experience, tracing how we live amid the inconvenient ghosts of history. &amp;#8220;The Burning of Lawrence&amp;#8221; vibrates with the raw terror of a town pillaged by pro-Confederate raiders. &amp;#8220;O Death&amp;#8221; recalls the desperately hard journey of the Exodusters&amp;#8212;African-American migrants who came to Kansas to escape oppression in the South. And, in the collection&amp;#8217;s haunting title piece, a professor of Kansas history surveys his decades-long slide from radicalism to complacency, a shift that parallels the landscape around him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using his own home state as a prism through which to view both a nation&amp;#8217;s history and our own universal battles as individuals, Milward has created one of the freshest and most complex story collections in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
