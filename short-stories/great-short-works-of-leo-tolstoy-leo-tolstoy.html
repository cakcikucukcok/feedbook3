  <title>Great Short Works of Leo Tolstoy - Leo Tolstoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Great Short Works of Leo Tolstoy&quot; collects nine stories by the Russian born author (1828-1910). Most known for &quot;War and Peace&quot; and &quot;Anna Karenina,&quot; considered two of the greatest novels in world literature, Tolstoy also penned numerous novellas and short stories which remain valuable classics in their own regards. &quot;Family Happiness&quot; explores the female identity within changing romantic relationships. Narrated in first person by the female protagonist Masha, the tale is a skilled and engrossing story of woman&#39;s difficult position in a shifting society. &quot;The Cossacks,&quot; Tolstoy&#39;s first novella, follows 24 year old Olyenin and his stuggle to win the heart of a young Cossack woman in pre-revolutionary Russia. &quot;The Death of Ivan Ilyich,&quot; one of Tolstoy&#39;s short masterpieces, tells of the early death of a high-court judge in 19th century Russian. In &quot;The Devil,&quot; two brothers struggle with a new inheritance riddled with debts when sudden romance and lust threaten to turn their world upside down. &quot;The Kreutzer Sonata&quot; is an intense tale of love, marriage, sex, and jealousy. Initially banned by the Russian censors, the novella has inspired many films, theater productions, and paintings. In &quot;Master and Man,&quot; a landowner and his peasant journey to purchase a small forest only to get caught in a blizzard. The ethics of self-sacrifice resolve this moralizing tale. &quot;Father Sergius&quot; tells of a young aristocrat who, upon discovery of his fiancé&#39;s infidelity, retreats into the life of a monastic Orthodox Christian, though this radically new life proves to be difficult. Tolstoy&#39;s last work, &quot;Hadji Murad,&quot; follows the Avar commander Hadji Murad as he forms an alliance with the Russians he had been fighting against for revenge&#39;s sake. Lastly &quot;Alyosha the Pot&quot; is a tragic tale of love and family pressure. Together, these nine stories form Tolstoy&#39;s greatest spread of shorter fiction." />
