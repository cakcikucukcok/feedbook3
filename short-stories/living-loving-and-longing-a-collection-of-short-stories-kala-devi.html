  <title>Living, Loving and Longing - a Collection of Short Stories - Kala Devi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living, Loving and Longing is a collection of short stories that explore love and life in modern India recounted in the old fashioned way. The stories bring out the euphoria of newfound love as also the yearning of those who have loved and lost. The protagonists range from the innocent child in kindergarten to the fanciful collegiate, a house-wife, a single working woman and even an elderly grandfather who cannot forget his first love.
The book has something for everyone and each story will touch your heart with its emotional connect. The reader is lulled into believing that they are reading about themselves or somebody very close to them, and then, in her own unmistakable style Kala Devi weaves a twist in the tale - that stay with them, long after they have turned the page." />
