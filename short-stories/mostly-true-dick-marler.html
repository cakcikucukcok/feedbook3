  <title>Mostly True - Dick Marler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mostly True Excerpts 
I might even get to see a real wild bison before they all disappear into a zoo or commercial ranch where they will join cows in their lifelong quest to become hamburger or jerky. 
Think of the bedlam at the coffee shop if all the dogs in the back of the trucks decided to change places with each other. Can you just imagine the confusion when they cant find their pickup in the parking lot because there is a poodle in the back instead of a pit bull? 
Well, I dont want to get young. I worked hard to get old and have earned every wrinkle, every strand of grey hair, and both semi-working knees. 
I was poked today. I dont know why. I didnt do anything to anyone to deserve it. All I was doing was taking a bit of time off from my chores to look around in Facebook on my computer, and there it was. A poke!" />
