  <title>Refund: Stories - Karen E. Bender</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;We think about it every day, sometimes every hour: Money. Who has it. Who doesn&amp;#8217;t. How you get it. How you don&amp;#8217;t.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bender uses this very powerful force to pull together a unified collection of stories that deeply explore the ways in which money and the subsequent estimation of value affect the lives of her characters. The stories in Refund reflect our contemporary world&amp;#151;swindlers, reality show creators, desperate artists, siblings, parents &amp;#151; who struggle to figure out how to obtain money, how to give it, earn it, lose it, all the while trying to answer the question: What is the real definition of worth?&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &amp;#147;Theft,&amp;#8221; an eighty-year-old swindler, accustomed to tricking people for their money, discovers she has Alzheimer&amp;#8217;s and boards a cruise ship to see if she can find something of true value&amp;#151;a human connection.  In &amp;#147;Anything for Money,&amp;#8221; the creator of a popular reality show is thrown into the real world when his estranged granddaughter reenters his life in need of a new heart; in &amp;#147;The Sea Turtle Hospital,&amp;#8221; a young teacher and her charge survive&lt;/div&gt;" />
