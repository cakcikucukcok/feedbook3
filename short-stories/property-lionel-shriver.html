  <title>Property - Lionel Shriver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A striking new collection of ten short stories and two novellas that explores the idea of property in every meaning of the word, from the acclaimed &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of the National Book Award finalist &lt;em&gt;So Much for That&lt;/em&gt; and the international bestseller &lt;em&gt;We Need to Talk About Kevin&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intermingling settings in America and Britain, Lionel Shriver&amp;#8217;s first collection explores property in both senses of the word: real estate and stuff. These pieces illustrate how our possessions act as proxies for ourselves, and how tussles over ownership articulate the power dynamics of our relationships. In Lionel Shriver&amp;#8217;s world, we may possess people and objects and places, but in turn they possess us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the stunning novella &quot;The Standing Chandelier,&quot; a woman with a history of attracting other women&amp;#8217;s antagonism creates a deeply personal wedding present for her best friend and his fianc&amp;#233;e&amp;#8212;only to discover that the jealous fianc&amp;#233;e wants to cut her out of their lives. In &quot;Domestic Terrorism,&quot; a thirty-something son refuses to leave home, resulting in a standoff that renders him a millennial cause c&amp;#233;l&amp;#232;bre. In &quot;The ChapStick,&quot; a middle-aged man subjugated by service to his elderly father discovers that the last place you should finally assert yourself is airport security. In &quot;Vermin,&quot; an artistic Brooklyn couple&amp;#8217;s purchase of a ramshackle house destroys their once-passionate relationship. In &quot;The Subletter,&quot; two women, both foreign conflict junkies, fight over a claim to a territory that doesn&amp;#8217;t belong to either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exhibiting a satisfying thematic unity unusual for a collection, this masterful work showcases the biting insight that has made Shriver one of the most acclaimed writers of our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
