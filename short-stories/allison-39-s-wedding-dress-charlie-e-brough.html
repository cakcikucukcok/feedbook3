  <title>Allison&#39;s Wedding Dress - Charlie E. Brough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Allison&#39;s Wedding Dress&lt;/I&gt;, one of the 46 short stories in this book is based on a young woman the author met and observed while living and working in Aberdeen, Washington. The fictionalized account of her life was chosen to be the cornerstone of this collection of short stories, all of which are written by the author of this book. This collection is sure to entertain readers of all ages. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Allison, raised by her great aunt and uncle, lived under extremely rigid conditions. She was forced to marry a total stranger who used her in place of frequenting the local brothel. Emotionally battered and practically brainwashed that she was going to go to hell, Allison lived a lonesome and forlorn life in her and John&#39;s tiny rundown home next to the railroad tracks. The very same house where her mother, by the same name, had died. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Many of these stories are true to life or based on real events from newspaper articles. &quot;Mega Woman&quot; details how winning the Mega Bucks lottery, may have changed the life of a young woman struggling to make ends meet.  Other stories answer questions never before answered, like, &quot;how did the SCUD missile come by its name?&quot; The &quot;Mystery Of The Mima Mounds&quot; is my offering of science fiction." />
