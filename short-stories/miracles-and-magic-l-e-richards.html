  <title>Miracles and Magic - L.E. Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Christmas is just not Christmas without the gifts of miracles and magic. In this trio of holiday tales, a mysterious stranger connects three families and illustrates how to find the joy and meaning not only just in Christmas, but also in everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To say that fourteen-year-old Billy is angry is an understatement. Orphaned two years earlier, he is exiled to a group home where he wonders if he will ever again find the happiness of a familys love. In Wooden Angels, with the help of an old man, Billy is about to discover the gifts he never knew he had. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In The Christmas Wish, after another fight with his father, teenager J.J. decides to run away from his lifeand his futureduring a Christmas Eve snowstorm. He soon realizes, with the help of a new friend, that anything is possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father Tim is struggling with his faith and the fact that his first parish will soon be demolished. Just when he thinks all hope is dashed, he meets a wise man who encourages him to always be willing to take a Leap of Faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Miracles and Magic&lt;/i&gt; shares the poignant journeys of three lost souls as they rely on a strangers gentle guidance and kind actions to find themselves and the significance behind Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
