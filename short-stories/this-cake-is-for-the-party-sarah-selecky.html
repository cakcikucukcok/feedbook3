  <title>This Cake Is for the Party - Sarah Selecky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shortlisted for the acclaimed 2010 Scotiabank Giller Prize, the Frank O&#39;Connor Short Story Award, and the Commonwealth Writer&#39;s Prize Best First Book Award, &lt;i&gt;This Cake Is for the Party&lt;/i&gt; has received consistent rave reviews praising debut writer Sarah Selecky.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these ten stories, linked frequently by the sharing of food, Sarah Selecky reaffirms the life of everyday situations with startling significance. For upmarket women&#39;s fiction readers that love stories which reflect the joys and pitfalls of marriage, fidelity, fertility, and relationship woes, this collection is a conversation starter. &lt;i&gt;This Cake Is for the Party&lt;/i&gt; reminds us that the best parts of our lives are often the least flashy. Reminiscent of early Margaret Atwood, with echoes of Lisa Moore and Ali Smith, these absorbing stories are about love and longing, that touch us in a myriad of subtle and affecting ways.&lt;br&gt;With more than 10,000 copies sold in Canada, where she was named the CBC Book Award&#39;s Best New Writer, Sarah Selecky proves she is an exciting new voice with a promising future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
