  <title>Bumping and Other Stories - W. Jack Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From a Southeast Asian jungle where the greatest safety is as close to the danger
as you can get, to a suburban backyard where a neighbors cat moderates
a wounded mans personal crisis to communicate, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bumping and Other Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is
all over the map. Jack Savage has assembled twelve very different tales including
a Ukrainian prisoners account of the improbable events in an abandoned
slaughterhouse leading to his twenty-fi ve year incarceration, a powerful off-stage
player reminded that some turns of our past can never be reconciled with
our present, and an estranged anniversary couple who forced to once again
choose each other.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bumping and Other Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an eclectic mix of stories about a past lost and
found, a present rediscovered, a recurring dream and a living nightmare with justice
to meat out, of a childlike wonderment, a life of learning lost, and two souls
sharing one affl iction. The stories are hopeful and often ironic but all with a certain
subjectivity that allows the reader a vote in the referendum of lifes little trials.
As Bernard in Savages &quot;Bumping&quot; puts it: ...the cavalcade of what-ifs that are still
mine to ponder." />
