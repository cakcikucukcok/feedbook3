  <title>Episodes - Annete Jackson-Cruel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Episodes is a collection of sensual, sexual, steamy, erotic scenarios that may or may not have actually ever happened.   Hmm  If they did, and you were a part of one of them, Im sure you were well satisfied as I myself was in order to have written about it.  If they did not happen, then I hope you enjoy the stimulating reading of each episode.  Even though Ive kissed and told, (well, lightly whispered), only I need to know your true identity, and I hope to see you again.  But if it wasnt all that then of course I had to improvise, elaborate, and invent to spice it up and make it sizzle, so dont take it personal. At least you were mentioned in some way.  Its all in what you think as a reader.  What you are willing to believe.  I wont admit to anyone what did or didnt happen; its for me to know and you to find out.  Those who know me well, already know, those who think they know me and those that dont know me, will just have to read the book and figure it out for themselves.  But why?  Why try to figure it out, it doesnt really matter what did or didnt happen.  What really matters is that you enjoy my book, and most definitely enjoy your own episodes created or brought upon by my stories.  It is up to the imagination of the reader to decide whether or not in their own mind what really happened, and how much they choose to perceive into reality.  The purpose of this book is to ignite a desire in the reader to inevitably spice up their intimate adventurers, hopefully with their own monogamous partner.  Monogamous, why you might say.  Because one on one is always better.  If you only have one partner, you can concentrate more, and center your energy to focus on pleasing that one person easier than two, three, or four.  This in turn will make them desire to, and please you more.  And then youll both be happy.  This is lifes truest treasure.  True Love.  If you dont have a monogamous relationship, then secure one with the definitive choice for you, because the adventure can only give what is put into it.  And if you plan on keeping your partner, then youve got to keep it spicy.  The ultimate erotic ecstasy can only be achieved when the fullest attention can be paid.  And the fullest attention can only be paid when the truest of loves is involved.  Otherwise, your mind wonders, as well as other parts of your anatomy.  As before said, one on one is always better.  Even though many of the Episodes are not written with one partner, they are only written in their present structure, only for the heightened rapture of sexuality eventually to come, and to come, and to come, well, you get the picture. 
I dare a reader to try to read, comprehend, and imagine themselves in the adventurers of this book non-stop all the way through without experiencing episodes of their own.  And if you can, then you have no feelings, no imagination, no sensitivity, no passion, no soul, and no idea thereof.  Because its so teasingly tempting, tantalizingly tasty, enticingly alluring, and provocatively desire filled that you will have to experience your own adventures in between reading about mine.
Good luck.  And have fun, and be safe" />
