  <title>In My World - Ruo Xing Antoinette Loh, Mark Ruben Abacajan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Benny the Cock is proud, vain, and boastful. He doesnt miss a chance to put the other animals down. When they decide to get even, hes surprised. Tori the Frog wants to learn how to fly. Hes jealous of the other creatures who can. When he gets the ability to fly, hes surprised by his familys reaction. 
Benny and Tori are the main characters in author Ruo Xing Antoinette Lohs In My World: The Cock Crows and Tori the Frog. Aimed at readers between the ages of four and eight, In My World is imaginative and entertaining. But its more than that. Its stories share an understated moral tone that can plant good ideals in young, impressionable minds. The Cock Crows and Tori the Frog can be interpreted on a moral and spiritual level, on an empirical level as experienced by most children, and on an educational level aimed at instructing and teaching young minds.
In My World: The Cock Crows and Tori the Frog may heal and inspire, all while being entertaining. It can also spark conversations about important topics." />
