  <title>Stories of Jerusalem, Israel and Other Loves - Norma Marx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;People in Jerusalem, Israel are like people everywhere. Yet, there is a difference. That difference made every day of the 17 years that Norma Marx lived there an adventure and/or challenge.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;It only takes the first three sentences of any one of her stories to totally captivate the reader. The characters are so alive that we find ourselves in the middle of each story. We are connected to life in Jerusalem and to the remarkable people who live there. Woven into the humorous stories of daily life are stories dealing with the realities of indiscriminate suicide bombings.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Along with recollections of Normas life in Jerusalem, Israel are stories of her familys love and wonder for the golden land of America.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Tales of Jerusalem, Israell, and Other Loves offers vignettes that provide an intimate look of life in Jerusalem,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;CENTER&gt;Praised for Stories of Jerusalem, Israel, and Other Loves&lt;/CENTER&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What a delightful and sweet gathering of vignettes by a great storyteller! I laughed, I cried, O remembered my life as a new immigrant in Israel the 1960s and 70s and wanted to hop on the next plane to Jerusalem!&lt;/P&gt; -Judy Ayal, Director of Visitor Services, The Berman Jewish Heritage and Holocaust Museum
&lt;P&gt;What a gift of love to her family, and everyone else. I found myself wishing that a grandmother of mine had taken the time to share stories so that our ancestors had been real people to us. As someone who works in the interfaith world, I will recommend this book-a fabulous book---to take a very intimate look at a Jewish way of life-the culture, fears, loves, joys and rituals that literally come alive to the reader!&lt;/P&gt; -Jan Swanson, Program Director, World Pilgrims
&lt;P&gt;These stories, written from the perspective of both a spectator and participant, have an authenticity that skillfully captures the unique and often bittersweet Jerusalem experience.&lt;/P&gt; -Roberta Chester, Editor and Author" />
