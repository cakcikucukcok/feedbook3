  <title>The Last Wilkie&#39;s - Jon Steiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Temper trantrums, doomed relationships, failed businesses, Magellan&#39;s crew and house-hunting... This is, at first glance, a quite disparate collection of stories. The settings range from New York, Texas and San Francisco to Sydney, Lismore and Malaysia. The characters vary in age from three years old in &#39;Rights of Man&#39; to nonagenarians in &#39;Shady Oaks.&#39; And yet this varied assemblage of work is unified by core themes that speak to us all: the search for one&#39;s place in the world, failed attempts to connect with other people and lofty aspirations not acted upon.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;The Last Wilkie&#39;s and Other Stories is a quirky collection of short stories that are by turns funny, dark and troubling. Effortless to read, these stories are laced with a quick, sardonic wit that pokes fun at the life narratives we so earnestly attempt to create.&#39; - BOOKS+PUBLISHING&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;Jon Steiner&#39;s writing manages to articulate last night&#39;s forgotten dreams.&#39; - MIKE TOPP, Sasquatch Stories&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;Jon Steiner&#39;s brilliant and innovative short story collection veers from surreal to hilarious to disturbing to touching and back again.
