  <title>Hodge Podge - Ken Layton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;HODGE PODGE is an extension of my imagination. It is a collection of stories I made up to entertain my grandkids and to test my ability as a writer. Most of the plots are fairly simple, but I have tried to make them sensible and to follow an understandable pattern, although for the most part on re-reading, I have over-used a bloody finish for most of my characters. I hope I have made my descriptive passages descriptive and distortions of realities believable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I first started writing prose, my intent was to see if I had the skills to do so. I went back into the notes and stories I had stored away (Im quite the pack rat) and found some that might be worked into a passable book. I put my poetry aside, (I had iUniverse publish &lt;I&gt;Light Verse &amp; Limericks&lt;/I&gt;) and decided that I had enough prose material to appease my ego. Thus, &lt;I&gt;HODGE PODGE&lt;/I&gt; materialized to satisfy me so that I could leave something else to posterity in book form.&lt;/p&gt;" />
