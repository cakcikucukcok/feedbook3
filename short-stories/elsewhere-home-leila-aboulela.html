  <title>Elsewhere Home - Leila Aboulela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since her award-winning debut novel, &lt;i&gt;Minaret&lt;/i&gt;, Leila Aboulela has been praised by J.M. Coetzee, Ali Smith, Aminatta Forna, and Anthony Marra among others for her rich and nuanced depictions of Islamic spiritual and political life. Her latest collection, &lt;i&gt;Elsewhere, Home&lt;/i&gt;, draws us ineluctably into the lives of immigrants at home and abroad as they forge new identities and reshape old ones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A young woman’s encounter with a former classmate elicits painful reminders of her former life in Khartoum. A wealthy young Sudanese woman studying in Aberdeen begins an unlikely friendship with one of her Scottish classmates. A woman experiences an evolving relationship to her favorite writer, whose portrait of their shared culture both reflects and conflicts with her own sense of identity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Shuttling between the dusty, sun-baked streets of Khartoum and the university halls and cramped apartments of Aberdeen and London, &lt;i&gt;Elsewhere, Home&lt;/i&gt; explores, with subtlety and restraint, the profound feelings of yearning, loss, and alienation that come with leaving one’s homeland in pursuit of a different life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;" />
