&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;Giving Birth to New Beginnings, is basically about giving birth to new beginnings through the works of faith; in ones or many lives to bring about changes in their lifes spiritually and naturally. Characters inside the book talks and pray about their trials and tribulations what they went through and how God allowed them to be born of his spirit and not of the flesh. All of the characters have sacrificed themselves as offerings to the Lord on the alter, by praying with an interception in the spirit. As well, they have released their duty of the flesh in order to gain the duty of the spirit. The duty of the flesh suits man, but the duty of the spirt suits the Lord. Through the nostrils of the Lord he smelled the characters characteristics of their prayers and allowed them to be born of his spirit. Each character demonstrates their characteristics how they laid out on the alter, waiting upon the Lord to receive birth in the spirit.&lt;/div&gt;
