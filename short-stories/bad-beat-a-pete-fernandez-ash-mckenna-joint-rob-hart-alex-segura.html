  <title>Bad Beat: A Pete Fernandez/Ash McKenna Joint - Rob Hart, Alex Segura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;An Ash McKenna and Pete Fernandez Joint&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When beloved college football star Raleigh &quot;The Gun&quot; Davis is suspected of shaving points, sports reporter Pete Fernandez is tasked with digging up all the dirt that&#39;s fit to print. Mired in his own mounting personal problems and drinking himself blind, Pete slams into an unexpected brick wall: Ash McKenna, an amateur private investigator with a very bad attitude. Both are looking for the AWOL QB, but their goals run counter to each other&amp;#151;Ash is trying to help an old friend, while Pete is looking to redeem his once-promising journalism career.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What they find is more than they bargained for&amp;#151;and more than they can handle alone. Can the unlikely duo find common ground in time to bust a dangerous crime ring? Or will they get tangled up in their own egos and agendas?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Acclaimed crime writers Rob Hart and Alex Segura pair up for a unique adventure that brings together their series characters Ash McKenna and Pete Fernandez for an untold tale of vice, double-crosses and the back alleys of suburban New Jersey. Before NEW YORKED and SILENT CITY, there was BAD BEAT.&lt;/div&gt;" />
