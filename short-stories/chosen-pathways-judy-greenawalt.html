  <title>Chosen Pathways - Judy Greenawalt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;That pesky, sneaky, window-peeking cat that wanders around the neighborhood, has cordially invited you to view and enjoy some more adventures of Kipper, Beauregard, and Tracker from &lt;B&gt;THE TWO LABS AND A BLOODHOUND, &lt;/B&gt;that reside with their humans in North Pownal, Vermont.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Chosen Pathways is a collection of short stories, some of which are told from the dogs&#39; point of view of some actual events that have happened. However, the dogs were gracious enough to allow their momma to sneak in and record some fictional stories, for a fee of course. Please be advised that payment was delivered in the form of doggy treats, mostly the chicken and yam wraps that the dogs all so dearly love! &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;So once again, kickback and relax, and enjoy the adventures of all, for every day is an adventure when you are owned by a dog. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To view some colored photos of the dogs, please go to &lt;U&gt;www.twolabsandabloodhound.com&lt;/U&gt; and follow the links.&lt;/P&gt;" />
