&lt;i&gt;My life is passing day by day
And there are many times I pray

To stand guard and to keep them near 
Somehow I wish that they would know 
That I have always loved them so&lt;/i&gt;
This and the other poems in this heartfelt collection work together to communicate Miners perspective of how life can be enriched by being surrounded with loving family, intimate relationships, and friendships that will last a lifetime." />
