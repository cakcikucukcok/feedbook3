  <title>New Poems, 1908 - Rainer Maria Rilke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1984 Edward Snow won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award of the Academy of American Poets for the first volume of these translations of Rainer Maria Rilke&#39;s watershed work, NEW POEMS, 1907. His work was praised for the resonance of the English and its faithfulness to the density and meaning of the German. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the poems in the first volume, these are presentations of objects, &quot;thing-poems&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Dinggedichte&lt;/i&gt;). In 1902 Rilke left Germany for Paris where he acted as the secretary to the sculptor Auguste Rodin. Rodin&#39;s craftsman-like approach, his steady discipline, and his relentless productivity inspired in Rilke a new poetic method: he, too would be a craftsman meticulously appropriating the world about him for his poetic vision. &quot;Somehow,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I too must come to make things; not plastic, but written things--&lt;i&gt;realities&lt;/i&gt; that emerge from handiwork. Somehow I too must discover the smallest basic element, the cell of &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; art, the tangible immaterial means of representation for everything.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Until this volume, Rilke&#39;s voice had come from the interior, expressing feelings and moods. Though always celebrated for his mastery of word-sound, rhythm, meter, and rhyme, Rilke had written poetry often married by sentimentality and insularity. NEW POEMS represented a turning point, an intoxication from the materiality of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW POEMS, 1908 contains such famous works as &quot;Archaic Torso of Apollo,&quot; &quot;Corpse Washing,&quot; &quot;Buddha in Glory,&quot; and &quot;Late Autumn in Venice.&quot; Rilke takes familiar figures--from a sundial to a stained-glass Adam and Eve--and refracts their presence into corporeality and spirituality. Rilke peers behind sculptural surfaces to the implicit desire or pain in the objects of our environment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
