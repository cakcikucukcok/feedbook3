  <title>Fade into Focus, Focus into Fade - Nick Armbrister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is Nick Armbrister&#39;s first volume of poetry from his ten years of writing (1996?2006). It contains both old and new poems on several types of subject matter-from life and love to Goth and war. The poems express his views and his creativity; his love of Gothic music, aircraft, the written word and weird girls inspire him and the end result is here. He wrote his poetry while in a variety of moods. Volume 2 will follow in the future with more of his poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
Nick has always been drawn to the weird and wonderful, and his poetry constitutes his small addition to this. The poems are simple and lasting, and make a graphic and often startling impact that cuts like broken glass." />
