  <title>The Moods of Presque Isle - Eugene H. Ware</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Moods of Presque Isle&lt;/b&gt; is a book of photography, poetry, and prose which provides a visual treat for your mind and eyes.  The poetry and photography blend to produce reflections and emotions within the reader. The setting is an eight mile long sand peninsula jutting out into Lake Erie.  Formed over the last thousand years and constantly moving with Lake Erie currents, it is the most visited state park in the Pennsylvania system of parks.  It is a haven for natural beauty, birds, animals and rare plants. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
Presque Isle seems to be one of the places on earth that God paused to create something special.  A place where man could stop and reflect on what is right about the world. A place to pause for a moment to drink in the beauty that nature has to offer. It is an enchanting place where colors seem brighter, air softer and where time moves slowly.  
Presque Isle is one of those places calm enough for you to get quiet inside yourself.  A place where solitude and reflection are greater gifts than sun and sand. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The subjects of the poems and prose in the book are varied. They run from colors of fall to the tiny kingdom found on the forest floor; from water lilies to the horrors of 9/11; from an approaching storm to a lovers hand and hand walk on the beach.  Season, colors, moods, and dreams fill the pages of this book of reflections and life experiences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As you read each poem, you will be able to slow down, take a minute to reflect on the complementary photographs accompanying the words.  The theme of the book is the beauty, quiet, and solitude offered by nature.  The author believes that if you love nature, nature will open up a whole new world for your enjoyment.   The book is an attempt to paint words and photography as one and create a Mood with nature for the reader. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
