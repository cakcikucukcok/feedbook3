  <title>Inspiration and Motivation (I Am) - Dana Sheree Coe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Inspiration And Motivation (I AM) is a dream come true!  This memorial treasury includes hundreds of original poems and writings organized in a diary of seven sections divided into chronological years. This beautifully crafted work of art is the most complete collection of Dana Sheree Coes inspirational and motivational poetry and writings ever published.  
This book has something for everyone! Youll find great substance, revelations, meditations, and confessions that will inspire, motivate, encourage, enlighten, and strengthen you through thought-provoking, burning, powerful, rich, and heavy words and expressions of love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self control. Every Time Youre There is a poem of faith that you can overcome any situation and you are not alone.  Cast All Your Cares is a poem of hope written years ago when pressing through difficult and hopeless-looking circumstances.  The Love of God is a poem about our greatest aim and the more excellent way of love.
Liberty
In the world, but not of the world,
Youre just passing through,
Sojourning here until you reach the land,
That God has prepared for you.
Wanting to be free,
from all that binds and constricts,
seeking liberty,
from all of lifes conflicts.
I must operate in the midst of order and organization,
So
Down with chaos and disorder,
down with confusion, and down with strife.
Up with order, up with clarity, 
up with victory, and abundant life.
For ye have been called unto liberty,
the price has been paid for your victory.
Stand fast therefore in the liberty,
wherewith Christ hath made you free.
I will have liberty!
I will be free!
I will be
Free from fear,
free from confusion,
free from darkness,
free from illusion.
Free from guilt,
free from shame,
free from sickness,
free  from pain.
Free from bondage,
free from depression,
free from burdens,
free from oppression.
Free from deception, 
free from lying,
free from disease,
free from dying. 
Free from doubt, unbelief, and fear,
Free from lack, poverty, and destruction,
Liberty and freedom are here!
Be not entangled again,
with the yoke of bondage or with sin
by love serve one another,
live in liberty and at peace with each other.
For ye have been called unto liberty,
the price has been paid for your victory.
Stand fast therefore in the liberty
wherewith Christ hath made you free
Galatians 5:1
only use not liberty as an occasion to serve the flesh.
Liberty!
