      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Streams of Consciousness 69Times&quot;
This Is Poetry!
&quot;...as the wind dances across the midnight sky
    hear the windchimes tickling your mind to find truth
   heed the wisdom as it fires off from the wisdom tooth...&quot;
&lt;p&gt;Come and take a sophisticated ride of poetry in motion!The &quot;floatry&quot; of this author is based on the voices whispering in the wind as they guide this conscious poet into realms of enlightenment. Romantic, Sultry and Honest is how this poet expresses himself while allowing the reader to journey within  his world of droning vibrations based on love and his deep profound passion for l i f e !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S of C 69Times is 269 pages full of beautiful art work, illustrations, photography and rich luscious poetry! It&#39;s been a while since someone has bared their soul in such a romantic, caring and self healing way, you can&#39;t help but to wonder how this &quot;ghetto buddha&quot;could have possibly journeyed such a path? Are the stories fiction or non?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travel through the gates of this mindful student as he steps into the Temple Hall of Shaolin and becomes the &quot;heart and spirit of the Buddha&quot;! Warning:some of the images shown and pieces written could make you want to become a disciple to &quot;The Way&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number 69 is prevalent throughout these 69 chapters for it represents balance as in the yin and yang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rule #9 at the temple is simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Do not judge any other, only judge your self&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout these pages, examine the wealth 
in written text form for the Mind, Body and Soul!
Some are 
erotic and others are brewed  in the conscious pool!
Some are hot while
others will keep you cool 
keep a cuspidor by your side
 just in case you start to drool!&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Welcome to the book of Life!&lt;/p&gt;
