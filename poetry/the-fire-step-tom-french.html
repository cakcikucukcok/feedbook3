  <title>The Fire Step - Tom French</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Even now, as we rise to check on the children where they sleep within earshot of the river, two midwives are rising in darkness to dress for all weathers . . .  Eight years after the appearance of Tom French&amp;#8217;s award-winning first collection The Fire Step confirms the promise and achievement of his debut. His &amp;#145;gift for creating stunning elegiac moments &amp;#151; and the overall effect of measured and often beautiful responses to the inevitable&amp;#8217; (Nua) extends to a number of poems which celebrate his children in subtle and artful tones and rhythms.  Other poems attend to everyday facts of ordinary lives &amp;#151; a family moving house, attending a midday recital, the consequences of a wet summer, and a rail commuter&amp;#8217;s journey home. As he traces his bloodlines he embraces various generations, while the book encompasses also a race meet on a strand at low tide, a eulogy on the demise of a letterpress printing works, and the rich imaginings of its longer poems.  The Fire Step is a book of requiems and salutations. From already auspicious beginnings Tom French arrives at an impressively accomplished, emotionally charged second stage.&lt;/div&gt;" />
