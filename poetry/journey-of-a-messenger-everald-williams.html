  <title>Journey of a Messenger - Everald Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Giving My Life to Christ
I would advise anyone who is planning to walk with God to consider the path they choose very carefully. I say this because one needs to be fully committed in their Christian pathway. They cannot expect to have one foot in the church and the other feet in the world. The Bible says, No one can serve two masters for Jehovah is a jealous God (Exodus 20:37).
After reviewing my past life and reflecting on the friends I grew up with, most of whom are now dead or in prison, I believe that if I did not follow God, I could have been in the same situation. I used to be a part of a group of roughly seventeen to eighteen young men. However, to date, there are only five of them remaining, including myself. Some of these young men died through illnesses, gang-related warfare, or encounters with police.
I know that giving my life to Christ was the best thing I have ever done. I am a witness, a messenger who God is using as an instrument to bring the Word to his people. I now believe that I have found my calling. My thirst for praising and worshiping God is unquenchable. Praise Ye the Lord. Amen." />
