  <title>My Todays Will Always Be Better Than Yesterday Because of You - Amanda M. Hinojosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Amanda Hinojosa has always wanted to write and has sought purpose in her writingspecial meanings that truly hit home. In this poetry collection, she tells the story of how she has overcome obstacles throughout her life to end up where she is today: in the arms of the man of her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through verse, she recalls the whirlwind of events that have marked her life from childhood through today. She asks vital questions and invites those who are important to her to play a part in her wedding. She also addresses readers in hopes of guiding others to help people in situations like her own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this autobiographical collection of poetry, Hinojosa seeks to share her story and reach out to those who are special to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Problems&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
Problems come and problems go each minute of the day.&lt;/br&gt;
Problems being solved, somehow along the way.&lt;/br&gt;
Some come; many go, through peoples ears they hear.&lt;/br&gt;
Problems always seem to flow away, so dont have any fear.&lt;/br&gt;
Problems can be easy, some are even hard.&lt;/br&gt;
Many can be sent, in a little card.&lt;/br&gt;
Many can be very weird, due to being plain,&lt;/br&gt;
Problems are this way, because theyre so hard to explain.&lt;/br&gt;
If this world that we live did not have one problem,&lt;/br&gt;
Our home would not be that exciting little blossom.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
