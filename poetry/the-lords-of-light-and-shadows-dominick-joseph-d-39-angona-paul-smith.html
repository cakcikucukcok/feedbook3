  <title>The Lords of Light and Shadows - Dominick Joseph D&#39;Angona, Paul Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Lords of Light and Shadows is my second book of poems. It is an easy read, and the poems deal primarily with love. Ive also included one poem from my first book Sand, Sea and Fog called Evening Time, as I consider it a pretty love poem. The last poem The Valley of the Shadow is dedicated to Edgar Allan Poe, who helped foster my interest in poetry. It was inspired by Poes poem Eldorado. I wrote it when I was eighteen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy my little book, and like my first book, it is dedicated to you the reader.&lt;/p&gt;" />
