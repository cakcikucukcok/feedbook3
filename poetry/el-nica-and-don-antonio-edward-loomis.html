  <title>El Nica and Don Antonio - Edward Loomis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;	The book gathers the work of two eminent writers with a view to making a window on Spain and Latin America as they were at the beginning of the Twentieth Century. These were two very different writers; but they knew and admired each other&#39;s writing. The Nicaraguan was a little older (born in 1967, while A.M. was born in 1875), and since he got an early start as a writer, his work was available to Machado. They belong together partly because they are so very different--together they give an idea of what was happening in the literary and intellectual worlds of Spain and Latin America. Included here are &quot;Colloquy of the Centaurs&quot; and &quot;Epistle&quot;, two long poems by Daro; and &quot;The Land of Alvargonzalez&quot;, by Machado, perhaps his best known work, and his longest in the poetic form.&lt;P&gt;	The translations are from Spanish into English free verse, which is rather nicely adapted to this purpose, being noticeably not prose, yet not heavily burdened with prosodic enterprises.&lt;P&gt;	The attempt is to offer some good things by these authors, thus encouraging readers to take up the originals, which are very nice, very nice.&lt;/P&gt;" />
