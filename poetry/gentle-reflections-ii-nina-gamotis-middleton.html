  <title>Gentle Reflections II - Nina Gamotis-Middleton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was in my mid-teens when my first poem spilled out of my heart. It was, however, void of any hope or expression of any confidence in a God&amp;#39;s love. It ends with the question, &amp;quot;Is there no answer for my agony?&amp;quot; This poem was not included in my first published collection in 1982, GENTLE REFLECTIONS, because the poems that followed as I matured, entered the workforce, and became a wife and mother were a compilation of poems reflecting a much brighter side of life and my experiences as a woman. I had yet to be introduced to my Lord and Savior on a personal basis in l982, though my precious Mother-in-law had offered some very strong evidence that there was a God who loved me. GENTLE REFLECTIONS II is record of my faith journey captured in a collection of prose and verse, filtered through the Holy Spirit, which has flowed from my heart since surrendering my life to Jesus Christ. I can clearly hear His voice now as He leads me through this earthly life, with anticipation of a blissful eternity with Him. It is my hope that, as you journey with me through my book, that you will find yourself somewhere along the way and be able to &amp;quot;Taste and see that the Lord is good&amp;quot;, and that the fruits of the Holy Spirit are freely given to any who will come and feast with Him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
