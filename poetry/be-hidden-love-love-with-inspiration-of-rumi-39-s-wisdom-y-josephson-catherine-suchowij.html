  <title>Be Hidden Love: Love with Inspiration of Rumi&#39;s Wisdom - Y Josephson, Catherine Suchowij</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recall a moment that changed your entire life. This is a story about such a moment that launches three years of the author&#39;s life transforming him into a completely different human being. This is a story about a boy coming of age into manhood and it is both raw and romantic. Written in unique diary format marking the passage of time in hours, days, weeks and months.  It is based on oral storytelling, not on written word. The story has huge impacts, incredible moments about the most innocent feelings of an 18 year old kid and a 33 year old woman with a PhD in Architecture who live the very traditional town of Shiraz, 400 miles south of Tehran. This love affair is forbidden by all traditional and moral measures, but is pure and true to the heart. This story is not meant to be read so much as felt. Reading this book will be a new experience, full of challenges, tears, laughs, wonders, poetry, erotic yet tender moments, all in rawness. There are no intellectual or disciplinary preservatives; this is truly &quot;organic writing&quot;" />
