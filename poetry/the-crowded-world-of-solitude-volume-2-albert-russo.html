  <title>The Crowded World of Solitude Volume 2 - Albert RUSSO</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Preface by LEIGH EDUARDO, 
British poet and musician.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have never met Albert Russo and yet, through his writing, I feel I have had that privilege.  He possesses that rare and enviable talent of being able to say what is important in a very few words.  His contributions to the literary world are amazingly varied, reminding one of an intellectual butterfly - able to flit from one topic to another, but having first drained it of its essential qualities.  Russo writes at all levels - a compulsive creator who is always going to have something important, or different , or both, to say. 
His work reaches into the very soul of contemporary living.  Here, one comes to grips with many contemporary problems, all beautifully crafted and possessing the Russo hallmark of subtle observation.  Each poem is a gem in its own right.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;EXPECTANCY
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
theres a world at peace and theres a world at war&lt;br&gt;
the frontiers between the two shift and overlap &lt;br&gt;
like waves over the breakers at low tide&lt;br&gt;
and as you watch the evening news&lt;br&gt;
you feel your heart skitter across the water&lt;br&gt;
on the safe side, or so you will yourself to believe&lt;br&gt;
but when in the dead of night you switch off the bedlamp&lt;br&gt;
the rumblings under your skin&lt;br&gt;
at first distant and familiar&lt;br&gt;
start sending out portentous signals&lt;br&gt;
then, somewhere around the solar plexus&lt;br&gt;
theres an expectancy of pain &lt;br&gt;
searing as the alarm caused by a misfired thunder&lt;br&gt;
it shoots through the arteries to the cortex&lt;br&gt;
making the flesh quiver in its wake&lt;br&gt;
and suddenly the echo of a reverberating crackle &lt;br&gt;
turns your entire body into an electric web&lt;br&gt;
so tightly packed you instinctively&lt;br&gt;
embrace all the destructive power&lt;br&gt;
of mankinds folly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
