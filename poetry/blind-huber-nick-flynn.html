  <title>Blind Huber - Nick Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Award-winning poet Nick Flynn takes readers into the dangerous and irresistible center of the hive&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I sit in a body &amp; think of a body, I picture&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Burnens&#39; hands, my words&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;make them move. I say, plunge them into the hive,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp; his hands go in.&lt;/i&gt;-from &quot;Blind Huber&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blindness does not deter François Huber-the eighteenth-century beekeeper-in his quest to learn about bees through their behavior. Through an odd, but productive arrangement, Huber&#39;s assistant Burnens becomes his eyes, his narrator as he goes about his work. In Nick Flynn&#39;s extraordinary new collection, Huber and Burnens speak and so do the bees. The strongest virgin waits silently to kill the other virgins; drones are &quot;made of waiting&quot;; the swarm attempts to protect the queen. It is a cruel existence. Everyone sacrifices for the sweet honey, except the human hand that harvests it all in a single afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blind Huber&lt;/i&gt; is about the body, love, and devotion and also about the limits of what can be known and what will forever be unknown. Nick Flynn&#39;s bees and keepers-sometimes in a state of magnificent pollen-drunk dizziness-view the world from a striking and daring perspective.&lt;/p&gt;" />
