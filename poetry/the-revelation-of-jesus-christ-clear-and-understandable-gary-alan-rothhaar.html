  <title>The Revelation of Jesus Christ Clear and Understandable - Gary Alan Rothhaar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The Revelation of Jesus Christ
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Clear and Understandable
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Now seems to be the time when we need to know about end time events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        &lt;br/&gt;
        Jesus said, Unto you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables.
         Mark 4:11
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Perhaps that is why God has chosen to write the book of Revelation with so much symbolism, and yet to us who believe in Jesus as our personal Savior,
        it is given to know the mysteries of God, but not without faithful study of His word.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        This study of Revelation is designed to de-code much of the symbolism by using related Old and New Testament scriptures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        The prophet Daniel was told to shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be
        increased. Daniel 12: 4
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        Its easy to see that Daniels prophecy is our reality. We are living in a time of modern methods of transportation and state of the art technical
        advancements, and yet these are perilous times of uncertainty and rapid change.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        God is not only the God of eternity; He is also the God of time. By His design, some things are hidden until He is ready to reveal them. Now seems to
        be the time when we need to know about the mysteries of God concerning end time events.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
