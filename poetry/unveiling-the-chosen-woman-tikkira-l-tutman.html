      <meta name="description" content="Tikirra Tutman has a story to tell, just like everyone else with a dream. As a little girl, she expected to one day become a famous basketball player, but once she discovered the power of the written word, her lifes path changed. She found a way to converse and survive by writing, and she hopes to pass that same endurance on to her readers.
Unveiling the Chosen Woman is a chronological journey through one womans life of victories and trials. Tutman has experienced muchthe good and badbut she has learned the good is not as good without the bad as a comparison. After all, there is no light without darkness. There is no victory without defeat.
Hers is a message of survival and triumph over fear. Still, her journey is not yet at an end. Daily she grows stronger, with the power of prayer, exercise, and writing. Some of her words are dark, yes, but she hopes to show that growth comes from the positive and negative aspects of life. Tutman has overcome her battles, and so can you." />
