  <title>Stained Glass Souls - Donald Queen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These scribbles have saved my sanity, if not my life. These meanderingswhich are fun, painful, and freeingwill be in five categories, though some could almost fit anywhere. It is a mix of my humor and anguish, which I often have to force out and, at other times, cant stop. This collection of words ranges from fear to love, from the creative process to nature and spirituality. These choices come from about a thirty-five-year span from the point of setting down the alcohol and drugs and trudging through years of anxiety and depression. Watch out for the second chapter, Mud, Molasses, and Stained-Glass Souls. This chapter shows my struggles to get past my self-centered fears. Dont linger in that mire. I almost didnt make it through the illusions. I just want to show that sometimes insanity and stupidity are on the same side of the path. If that crazy chapter is too dark, just run to the next one. I dont need to live in it anymore, though I dont want to forget where Ive come from. I just hope someone can find something in here to embrace or let go." />
