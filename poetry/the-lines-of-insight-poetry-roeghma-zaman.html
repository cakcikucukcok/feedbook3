  <title>The Lines of Insight, Poetry - Roeghma Zaman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name Roeghma is the acronym for the name Rughma. The meaning of my name means, Rain, Mercy and Blessing. It is an Arabic name. I was named after my aunt. She was a very attractive women and a very kind person. She died last year 2013. I have grown to love my name, mostly because it means mercy, the ability to forgive. 
Mercy is the one Quality and name of God that he loves most about himself. Al Rughman is one of Allahs 99 names. It is the name her loves most. I feel blessed to have this name, mercy because I can open my heart and forgive. I can let go of past and love. I thank my father for giving me this name. It is a blessing to be able to forgive, it bring about happiness. 
I am my namesake. The first letters of my name is (Roegh), which means soul. My soul is on this earth and it has a lot of love and forgiveness for people. May you too research your name and love your name. Whatever your name is you too can have mercy and blessing in your life. In this book I write about what I see in nature, what I see some peoples behavior; it is what I see with my eyes and hear with my ears. Read my book!" />
