  <title>Mime Musings - Charles Cozart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Having been raised in a small town in the Panhandle of Oklahoma, I had a very narrow vision of life and of the world. There were so many questions that I did not know that I needed to ask. I remember driving down the red brick paved main street wondering is this really all there is. So, I left. &quot; Mime Musings&quot; is a look into the search for and finding of a great big,colorful, magical world. These poems are part love, part revolution, part emotion served up with a heaping helping of mental madness. The illistrations are an attempt  to capture the immages taht the words paint in line, space, and order. All the characters are real even the ones that have been created from bits and peaces of this person then the other. All who have come to live within the pages and verses of this book. &quot;Mime Musings&quot; is the findings that has resulted from a search for a vision of a world painted with the strokes of a very wide brush. &quot; Mime Musings&quot; begins with the poem &quot;Lives and ends with the poem &quot;Circles. Inbetween you will find alot of yourself within these verses and immages that come off the pages of this book. It is possible, that you will recall visions from your own journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yes, the search continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!!!&lt;/p&gt;" />
