  <title>Feral - Kate Potts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;These poems are luminous despatches from the charged, porous boundary between ‘animal’ and ‘human’. They pull apart and remake definitions and categorisations of wildness and civilisation, training their focus on the language we use to describe youth, social class, and the body. From iron horses to grizzly bears, from deep-water fish to scanderoons, &lt;i&gt;Feral&lt;/i&gt; roams the limits of power, language, and love. Cinematic, playful, edgy, tender, startlingly imaginative and strange, &lt;i&gt;Feral&lt;/i&gt;’s voices carve out a space in the borderlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Potts&#39; &lt;i&gt;Whichever Music&lt;/i&gt; was a Poetry Book Society Pamphlet Choice in 2008 and shortlisted for a Michael Marks Award. Her first book-length collection, &lt;i&gt;Pure Hustle&lt;/i&gt;, was published by Bloodaxe in 2011. &lt;i&gt;Feral&lt;/i&gt; is her second collection and is a Poetry Book Society Recommendation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;Intricate, vital-tender, dazzling work — Potts’ poetry sings even as it bares its teeth.&#39; – Eley Williams on &lt;i&gt;Feral&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#39;&lt;i&gt;Pure Hustle&lt;/i&gt; is a gem of book in which Kate Potts conjures a poetry which astonishes and moves the reader. The texture of her language – its deft and surprising turns, its intense musicality – allows the many voices in these poems to soar. Her curiosity and profound intelligence means that the poems range wonderfully far and wide in setting and subject-matter from the urban clutter of contemporary settings, to modern variations on pastoral, to Penelope weaving, to a beached whale, and more. Kate Potts is a poet whose ear and eye for her work are as close to perfect as can be: &lt;i&gt;Pure Hustle&lt;/i&gt; is pure gold.&#39; – Jo Shapcott&lt;/p&gt;" />
