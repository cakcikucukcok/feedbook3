  <title>Emotive Writing. I, writer by chance - Giovanni Tommasini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
My story, a writer by chance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A deep reflection on the readers comments. Its pages touched me My writing, your reading, routes covered together. A journey inside ourselves from our daily experiences always in search of a meaning, passing through the memories, to emotions. This is the story of a writer by chance, me, and my discovery of a method of expression. The texts creation, which is present inside of us, that needs to be rendered in order to make our life experience a way to propose and follow.&lt;br /&gt;
The emotive writing and reading.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Giovanni Tommasini&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;An uncommon and curious setting that makes the tale, or the poem, intriguing; the whole book is a poetry treatise. I cant put it down; its never slow or too descriptive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A writer by chance... yet not so fortuitous in the end: Giovanni Tommasini writes for all, using an experiential language full of his own past experience and rich in reflections, thoughts, translations of feelings. I recommend this book to those who want to get in touch or meet again with and in a beautiful person. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
