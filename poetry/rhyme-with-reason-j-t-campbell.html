  <title>Rhyme with Reason - J.T. Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A way of life was changed forever,
When, the sails appeared in the bay.
 When my wife told me I had to leave, it was just after New Year s Eve 2000. A catalyst for change. If ever, there was one.
At 38, I had to take a good look, at who I was,
And how, I had arrived there..
This collection of stories was written, so I could have a better understanding of myself. To be honest, about my role, in my life. The good. The bad, and the ugly. 
Each rhyme created, by the emotion I felt, while contemplating different situations i had been involved in since I was a child. 
A friend of mine told me once, theres a poem in there for everyone. I would like to think he was right.
My, journey of discovery, has taken me to some amazing places, and allowed me to do things I could only have dreamed of. The most amazing thing of all..., I had become someone I could live with!!" />
