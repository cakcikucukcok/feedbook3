  <title>Date of Entry - Emmy Vargas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Date of Entry is a compilation of poems I kept in several notebooks in which Ive used to express myself throughout the years. I write about love lost and found, about self doubt, about low self-esteem, and about being in a relationship involving domestic violence and staying in it because I didnt love myself enough or felt worthy enough to get out early on. But through Gods grace, I did. One day in a dream, while I was in a medically induced coma for three weeks after an accident I suffered about four years ago now, I had an outer body experience. I was walking through parts of my life, looking at myself while traveling through dates in time. It was bizarre but so life-changing. I could see that from my first date of entry (the day I was born), I had been through a number of lifes inevitable trials, yet I was awake and still alive. Thankful for the experience and feeling renewed, I knew then it was time to finally fulfill my purpose in writing Date of Entry. I know Im doing what I was created to do. I believe that when we share, we teach and we inspire. And that to me is the sole purpose of this book." />
