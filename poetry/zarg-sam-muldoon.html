Born out of the unending creative flow of his many art forms comes his first collection, whittled down from over three thousand verses to create this definitive volumea cornucopia of lyrical, rhythmical poems of sonnet style and pure abstraction.

Readers will discover an abundance of creative inspiration within the written words of Muldoon and also poems to warm the heart, raise a smile, or merely motivate a brief pause for thought. Embrace the beauty, and live for today." />
