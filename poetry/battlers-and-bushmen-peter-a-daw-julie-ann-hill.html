  <title>Battlers and Bushmen - Peter A Daw, Julie-Ann Hill</title>

He became a Plant Attendant at the Port Augusta Power Station until his retirement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His recount of life on the Birdsville Track is his acknowledgement of those who shared their knowledge with him in his early days; a story for those who want to hear of the life and experiences of Australian Bushmen; and, a celebration of all those who have crossed his path and become lifelong friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;?The story is in his own words.&lt;/p&gt;" />
