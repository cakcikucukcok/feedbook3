  <title>Just Give It Some Thought - Patricia Ann Lightner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection, a reflection, upon everyday life. It is a good read for oneself or as a gift. It inspires the reader whether through poetry, essays, the Bible, and holiday memories. 
A minister was interviewed by the author about his mission work overseas. Also read the heartwarming story about the little boy at Vacation Bible School who craved attention, even negative attention. 
Advocacy work for increased medical research funding for better treatments and cures for diseases, has been a large part of the authors life over fifteen years. She shares with the reader her guide to building relationships with elected officials, both locally and in Washington, D.C. For good measure, our furry friends are not left on the sidelines. The author wrote a short story, an appeal, a plea if you will, about taking care of our four legged friends. It has good humor and all of us can just give it some thought during our everyday reflections." />
