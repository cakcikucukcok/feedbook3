  <title>The Weeping Love - F. Shelton Gonkerwon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Weeping Love: A New Creation After the Storm entails a stimulating romance accounts that depict some sad events that often plague love regime and provoke unconscious disintegration in marital union. The book attempts to present love as an original instrument whose power works spiritually based on nature over which the human mind, heart, and soul have no absolute control. It essentially argues that the natural price for love is love, and not luxuries and other influential elements, including money, power, as is considered by many persons as precondition for sustainable marital union. The book equates love to truth that is never susceptible to falsehood.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;It presents the fact that love, like the sky, which is often defaced by dark cloud, has its unavoidable share of temptation, frustration, and other vices. It maintains that sustained love, like long-lasting peace, is the end result of social turbulence and conflict.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Readers will realize that love that serves as long-lasting foundation in marital life is not often earned on a silver platter. Like gold, it is has its own processing fire, including temptation, disappointment, as well as frustration. Indeed, marriage tested by these factors often enjoys endurance and blessings. Contained potentially with literary exposition, the book is also annexed by captivating poems and some philosophical expressions that are useful for daily guide.&lt;/p&gt;" />
