      <meta name="description" content="On June 28, 2005, twenty-five year-old Erik took his life after seven years of struggling with a mental condition, a day that would forever change the lives of his family. Erik was struck down in the prime of life with an illness incurable and so destructive, one cannot even imagine the incredible mental pain he suffered with every day: unable to be with his friends because of the symptoms and disturbing images, being afraid people could see something was wrong, becoming more and more isolated, robbing him of the joy and happiness we all deserve as human beings, the loneliness becoming unbearable. Out of this devastating event came these inspiring poems written by his father. It has become a source of healing not only for him and his family but an inspiration to others who have endured the great pain of losing a child. He is gone but our family needed a place to tend the great love for him that remains. These poems show that love as well as the pain, guilt, forgiveness and the struggle to go on without him, but knowing he is finally at peace." />
