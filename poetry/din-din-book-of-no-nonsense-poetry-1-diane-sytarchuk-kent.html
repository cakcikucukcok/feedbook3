  <title>Din Din Book of No-Nonsense Poetry#1 - Diane Sytarchuk-Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is a book of easy reading poetry that is meant for everyone&#39;s pleasure especially someone who likes a good rhyme.&lt;p&gt;More importantly it has a bonus of having social stories in the margins of all the pages of poetry to help a developmentally challenged child understand what is in the text of the poem. Diane has found that social stories are very helpful in teaching her autistic child to understand concepts he may not otherwise be able to understand. These pictures and corresponding text would be a good way to pass on social skills to people like her child. She has found that social skills are at the very root and basis of a meaningful life and help enrich the learning experience.&lt;p&gt;This has helped her child to understand difficult concepts and has worked well in conjunction with the medicine he takes from a well recognized physician. She wants to make as much of this new language as she can. This is her first book and hopefully the first of many.&lt;/p&gt;" />
