  <title>Roses Amidst the Thorn: the Parched Garden - Simone C. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Parched Garden continues the couples progression after
Roses Amidst the Thorn. In Roses, we experience the birth, the
spiritual co-existence and the unforeseen crumbling of the couples
relationship. The couple finds themselves in a season of dryness. They
now live in the wilderness of a broken relationship. They experience
a place within themselves where they find no reprieve or solace.
They dont understand what has happened and why God seems
to have not helped them find answers to their questions. Though
the separation has come, there exist a spiritual connection which
continues to bind the couple. They are very much aware of the hurt
and pride keeping them from reaching out to each other. Instead of
forming a mutual bridge of communication, they begin to search
within themselves looking for understanding and insight.
They search for what has brought them to this place. They try
to make sense of the devastation left behind; to understand the
indifference of their families and close friends, to judge whether
their shaken foundation is beyond repair. Finally, to grasp some
insight that allows them to know that they will come through their
experience.
Knowing within themselves that forgiveness and reconciliation
are possibilities the couple must endure the winter season of their
relationship. At its end, they will either continue as a couple or
part as individuals who have grown from this ordeal.
In Gods silence towards them, He still draws them closer to
Him. He brings them closer to The Living Water that can
only quench the thirst of those who have dwelled in this spiritual
wilderness. For in this wilderness, water is available to any who
choose to dig deep enough!
The Parched Garden is the internal spiritual struggle to
keep digging for The Healing Living Water, so that we learn
to nourish the spiritual gardens inside ourselves. We must learn
to love ourselves as much as our heavenly Father loves us. Thereby
allowing us to extend that love and forgiveness unconditionally to
others!
