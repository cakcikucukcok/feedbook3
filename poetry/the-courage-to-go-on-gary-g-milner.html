  <title>The Courage to Go On - Gary G. Milner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born in Annapolis Royal and raised in a little backwoods country Rd: called Guinea, I was raised in an Alcoholic family and went through many abuses; verbal, emotional, physical and sexual, I really didnt have much of a chance for survival from the start. My father was a very miserable drunk, and he put my mother through hell. If you knew my mother, than you would know that she did not deserve the abuse that he inflicted on her or us children. The only values that I learned as a child was how to drink, lie, beat on a woman, cheat and steal.
I carried these values from childhood to now, going through four marriages and many jobs and covered myself with alcohol and drugs.
This is the compelling story of my life, and how after forty years of addictions I found a way through faith to climb out of that cesspool. All of my poetry is based on my own true feelings, which comes from a deep dark part of my very soul.
Through my poems I am able to put my feelings out and forward, to be able to free my demons and how I survived from the world of drugs and alcohol.
