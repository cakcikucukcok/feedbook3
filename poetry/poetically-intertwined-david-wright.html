  <title>Poetically Intertwined - David Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My name depicts three different colors, and as you know, there are a variety of colors in this world. Colort o me is a way for nature to express itself as an even-tempered or moody hue. Without color, we would live a dull, boring, conventional life.I believe that color and personality compare in many ways. We all share a variety of emotions and characteristics that make us unique and individualized. If we were all the same, we would walk around like &amp;quot;I Robots&amp;quot; obeying commands and following the leader, while lacking the most essential aspect of who we are--feelings. I would like to share the variety of different ideas and freedom of expression of each poem written in this book. I want to share my hope, inspiration, love, encouragement, but most importantly my experience, including some &amp;quot;rainy days,&amp;quot; with my readers. If I can change one person&amp;#39;s life, then my accomplishments would be rendered. I hope my poems will make you make you dream and open you thoughts to &amp;quot;unequivocal master of thinking.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;You will see that all of us will fear and fail but eventually all become brave, courageous conquerors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
