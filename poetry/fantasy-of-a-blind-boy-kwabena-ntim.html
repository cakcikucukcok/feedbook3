  <title>Fantasy of a Blind Boy - Kwabena Ntim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="FANTASY OF A BLIND BOY
He is a blind boy from the west coast of America.
And he walked upon the road. The rough road like
the one in Africa. He smiled like the soldier, toys
and the prince of Rome. He is a blind boy from an
imaginary city. He came from the state of Lords.
He is the blind boy from America. And he battled
the mirrors of blindness. He is a soldier and king
of the American Island. He is a warrior and ruler.
And he is blind upon the brown road of California.
He is a blind boy from the west coast of America.
And he waved the armours upon his arms like owls,
squirrels, the red snakes, cobras and the red sea.
It is the king of the dark tomb. It is the red bees.
The blind boy laughed to the rumours of a mutter.
And he is blind. He is a blind boy from California.
He is the prince of a dark city like the wise priest.
He is the World greatest king upon the grey road,
the murky mountain, the grey pavement and roots.
He is a blind boy from the west coast of America.
And he is the master of a grey road. He is a king.
It is the priest of heavy rings. It is a champion, a
superstar, a trap star, a legend and a prince here.
And he smiled towards a path of the blind soldier,
towards the path of the dead souls and the kings.
He is the blind boy upon the city like a grey stool.
And it sat on the stool of the Romans. It is crows.
The blind boy walked upon the grey road and path." />
