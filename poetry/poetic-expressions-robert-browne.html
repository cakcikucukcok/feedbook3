  <title>Poetic Expressions - Robert Browne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A collection of some 70 poems that get to the bottom of matters dealing with emotions and qualities-simple and complex. The author seeks to mentally and emotionally connect with the reader&#39;s own mind set about family, men, women, God, our planet, decisions made with their life now that can change their own future course for the better or the worse. In his writings, Robert doesn&#39;t spare himself of his own faults which are poetically mentioned in some of his poems. He highlights his failures along with the successes to strike a much needed balance so as to give his readers an honest portrait of the man many may come to know thru this book. Many will find a poem or more that will make an instant connection with the author. Some of the poems may, otherwise, be more complex for others. The hope is that all who embrace the collection of poems will find peace in their hearts with who they are now and know truly what may need to change in order to increase their personal satisfaction in life and truly be of more benefit to others." />
