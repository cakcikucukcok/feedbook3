  <title>Bluestone - James Lasdun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A generous selection that shows the poet James Lasdun at his lyrically inventive best&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two men grapple with jumper cables, trying &quot;to make a stand // in this last corner of our realm; machinery . . .&quot; A man on his way to see his therapist encounters a female police officer in an elevator and feels himself regressing to &quot;the original essence, the masculine / criminal salt.&quot; A teenager is tricked into eating a spoonful of lime pickle by his girlfriend&#39;s father. An Englishman in the Catskills ponders the nature of exile, is chased by yellow jackets, gets a haircut. James Lasdun&#39;s subjects are often quotidian--but his treatment of them never is. Under his transformative gaze, the familiar becomes strange, the local becomes foreign, and the minor becomes epic.&lt;br&gt;Lasdun has been winning acclaim since his first collection, 1988&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Jump Start&lt;/i&gt;--Helen Vendler has lauded his ability to give &quot;brisk shape to contemporary and classical events&quot;; &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; has praised the &quot;sharp, slicing imagery&quot; of his work. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Bluestone&lt;/i&gt;, which selects from all three of his previous collections and includes poems from his fourth, &lt;i&gt;Water Sessions&lt;/i&gt;, previously available only in the U.K., readers will be able to appreciate the full sweep of this capacious talent: his delicate wit, his gift for invention, his keen observational eye. It is a gathering that affirms Lasdun&#39;s position as, to quote Anthony Hecht, one of &quot;the most gifted, vivid, and deft poets now writing in English.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
