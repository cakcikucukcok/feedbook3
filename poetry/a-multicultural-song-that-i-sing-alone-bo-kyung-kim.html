  <title>A Multicultural Song That I Sing Alone - Bo Kyung Kim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She is a serious poet who is writing with wit, dedication and thoughtfulness. I admire greatly her wonderful skills with language, dance and culture. She in-deed brings many things of beauty to the world and that is everyones good fortune.
- Laurie Ramey. Poet, Professor and Center for Contemporary
Poetry and Poetics Director, Cal State Los Angeles.
With lyricism and a chord of ontological idealism, the book, A Multicultural Song that I Sing Alone releases the hopeful poetry drastically to the readers of the world with all kinds of enthusiasms and dreams, not only affecting and encour-aging but also securing endless beauty. In her writing, she absorbs many artistic facts and expresses into her poetic field ambitiously and positively with a refined mind, a pure image and sincere language.
- Tae Ho Kim, Literature Critic, from his Critical Essays
In here, I spread the seeds of multicultural love, peace, dance and songs. From Asia to the whole world, from the origin of human history to today, from little things to great things, visible, and invisible, looking for the gold vein of under-ground in languages, picking well ripened fruits, living as a fisherman on this land is very fun. Multiculturalism might be the ideal of human pursuits, as hu-mans are not just single celled and have not just one sense of taste. Autumn times come down slightly, seducing the green climax of summer and color of nature. The sky gets dark. Maybe the weather will change.
