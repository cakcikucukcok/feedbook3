  <title>A Scattering and Anniversary - Christopher Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An exploration of love and loss by the renowned Costa Award-winning poet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;You lived at such speed that the ballpoint script &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;running aslant and fading&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;across the faded blue&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;can scarcely keep up. Many words are illegible. I miss&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;important steps. Your movements blur. I want to follow, but can&#39;t.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Scattering &lt;/i&gt;is a book of lamentation and remembrance, its subject being Christopher Reid&#39;s wife, the actress Lucinda Gane, who died of cancer at the age of fifty-five. First published in the UK in 2009 to wide acclaim, winning the Costa Book of the Year, this moving and fiercely self-reflective collection is divided into four poetic sequences. The first was written during a holiday a few months before Gane&#39;s death with the knowledge that the end was approaching; the second recalls her last courageous weeks, spent in a hospice in London; the third continues the exploration of bereavement from a variety of perspectives; and the fourth addresses her directly, celebrating her life, personality, and achievements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paired for the first time with &lt;i&gt;Anniversary&lt;/i&gt;, which was written to commemorate the tenth anniversary of Gane&#39;s death, &lt;i&gt;A Scattering and Anniversary &lt;/i&gt;brings the poet into dialogue, again, with the wife he loved. A moving exploration of the stages of grief and how the &quot;weighty emptinesses&quot; that remain after bereavement change us, &lt;i&gt;A Scattering and Anniversary &lt;/i&gt;shows us what it means to love, lose, and--forever changed--continue on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
