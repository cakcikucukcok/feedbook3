  <title>3:30 - Geoff Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="3:30 a man wakes up after hearing a voice.  He flips on a light and searches his memory. Someone or something has sent a message that requires a response or immediate  action.  Reaching for pen &amp; paper, he waits for words to  begin. The texts that follow are half-conscious attempts  at recognizing that these same words preceded this life  and had directed it from before the beginning.
Readers Comments
Emerging from a hypnagogic state, Peterson writes of love, loss and a way home. His poems hover off-shore between lands end and the horizon. Stumbling through the pains of aging only makes the work more poignant.
 Douglas Leichter, artist
    New York-Tucson
3:30 is terrifically dense and by turns morose, enlightening and painfully touching, many of the pieces uncomfortably surreal                                 
Trish Haines, 
   Dharma disciple
Hard-bitten poems of aging &amp; loss: The man carried the death of his mother throughout his life. Add to that the loss of Margot, his lover of later years, and he wakes at 3:30, inconsolable. It takes courage to write these poems and even more to publish them, and sometimes as much to  read them.                                        
Andrew Vinca
   Poet on the Roof
These poems speak to the uncertainty &amp; vulnerability we experience upon waking in the pre-dawn and glimpsing up close that were but a small cog in an unfathomable  universe, and still we long for people &amp; places weve lost.
