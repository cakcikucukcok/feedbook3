  <title>The Fragility of Power - Stefano Rebeggiani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Statius&#39; narrative of the fraternal strife of the Theban brothers Eteocles and Polynices has had a profound influence on Western literature and fascinated generations of scholars and readers. This book studies in detail the poem&#39;s view of power and its interaction with historical contexts. Written under Domitian and in the aftermath of the civil war of 69 CE, the &lt;em&gt;Thebaid &lt;/em&gt;uses the veil of myth to reflect on the political reality of imperial Rome. The poem offers its contemporary readers, including the emperor, a cautionary tale of kingship and power. Rooted in a pessimistic view of human beings and human relationships, the &lt;em&gt;Thebaid&lt;/em&gt; reflects on the harsh necessity of monarchical power as the only antidote to a world always on the verge of returning to chaos. While humans, and especially kings, are fragile and often the prey of irrational passions, the &lt;em&gt;Thebaid&lt;/em&gt; expresses the hope that an illuminated sovereign endowed with &lt;em&gt;clementia&lt;/em&gt; (mercy) may offer a solution to the political crisis of the Roman empire. Statius&#39; narrative also responds to Domitian&#39;s problematic interaction with the emperor Nero, whom Domitian regarded as both a negative model and a secret source of inspiration. With &lt;em&gt;The Fragility of Power&lt;/em&gt;, Stefano Rebeggiani offers thoughtful parallels between the actions of the &lt;em&gt;Thebaid&lt;/em&gt; and the intellectual activities and political views formulated by the groups of Roman aristocrats who survived Nero&#39;s repression. He argues that the poem draws inspiration from an initial phase in Domitian&#39;s regime characterized by a positive relationship between the emperor and the Roman elite. Statius creates a number of innovative strategies to negotiate elements of continuity between Domitian and Nero, so as to show that, while Domitian recuperated aspects of Nero&#39;s self-presentation, he was no second Nero. Statius&#39; poem interacts with aspects of imperial ideology under Domitian: Statius&#39; allusions to the stories of Phaethon and Hercules engage Domitian&#39;s use of solar symbols and his association with Hercules. This book also shows that the &lt;em&gt;Thebaid&lt;/em&gt; adapts previous texts (in particular Lucan&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Bellum Civile&lt;/em&gt;) in order to connect the mythical subject of its narrative with the historical experience of civil war in Rome in 69 CE. By moving past recent solely aesthetic readings of the &lt;em&gt;Thebaid&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Fragility of Power &lt;/em&gt;offers a serious and thoughtful addition to the recent scholarship in Statian studies." />
