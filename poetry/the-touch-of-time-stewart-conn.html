  <title>The Touch of Time - Stewart Conn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Touch of Time is a comprehensive retrospective of the work of one of Scotland&#39;s leading poets drawing on ten previous books published over five decades. The new work here pursues the themes of his earlier Bloodaxe collections Stolen Light: Selected Poems (1999), Ghosts at Cockcrow (2005) and The Breakfast Room (2010). With what Professor Carla Sassi sees as &#39;his thoughtful attention to small details, his redeeming gaze, his formal control of impeccably constructed verses, and his deep and warm humanity&#39;, he movingly explores everyday events and revelations, and how - like our lives and those of our loved ones - they are transformed by time." />
