      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For me Life is a journey. With this end goal in my life I have always tried to outgrow myself. I am lover and a believer, and I am strong believer in life. Life is a experience which needs to be felt. To feel life, one has to live with it. And so I am dedicating my first book to Life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has been divided into three sections : Love, Live and Life. Though the author has made a diligent effort to make sure that each poem appeals in the specific section of the book, it might be possible that reader disagrees. Author asks for this disagreement. In fact, from authors point of view &lt;em&gt;: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;a good poetry is one that doesnt impose specific interpretation. The good poetry is individualistic, it lets one interpret one&#39;s own meaning of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this thought, the author is presenting the book to the readers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
