  <title>Sister Theresa’S Lighthouse - Theresa West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here it is! I am writing one and two editions of gospel poems for my book manuscript, entitled, Sister Theresas Lighthouse. I am called Sister Theresa West by my church congregation members and my close christian friends in my community. As a woman of God, I was blessed with the gift of writing gospel poems and quotes throughout my teenage and adulthood years. I have been collecting gospel poems and rap lyrics throughout the years while not only learning about Righteousness, but experiencing it and understanding the values of being a Christian, and pitfalls of getting caught up in the wrong path. Sister Theresas Lighthouse includes poems that give expressions of thanks to god, our Creator, our Father, and our lover, and also my words of expression give explanations of how wonderful it is to be obedient to God, Almighty. I write these poems as ammunition to fight against Satan who tries so much to rid us of the light of gospel truth. This time has come for me to rearrange these powerful lyrics in this book and to be read out loud or read as a rap lyric. For instance: No matter what others say, others do, Stay on, the right path, It will benefit you!!! Another poem I wrote: Im a preacher of God Most powerful stuff, Exploiting His Word, Midst the smooth, and the rough! Yes, these poems are like the lighthouse on a hill that gives directions of not only going the right way, but also knowing how to avoid the danger zones. This book of gospel verses gives light . . . .but at a wider range. Written by TWEST" />
