  <title>Faithful and Virtuous Night - Louise Gluck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the 2014 National Book Award for Poetry&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A luminous, seductive new collection from the &quot;fearless&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;) Pulitzer Prize-winning poet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Louise Gl端ck is one of the finest American poets at work today. Her &lt;i&gt;Poems 1962-2012 &lt;/i&gt;was hailed as &quot;a major event in this country&#39;s literature&quot; in the pages of &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;. Every new collection is at once a deepening and a revelation. &lt;i&gt;Faithful and Virtuous Night&lt;/i&gt; is no exception.&lt;br&gt;     You enter the world of this spellbinding book through one of its many dreamlike portals, and each time you enter it&#39;s the same place but it has been arranged differently. You were a woman. You were a man. This is a story of adventure, an encounter with the unknown, a knight&#39;s undaunted journey into the kingdom of death; this is a story of the world you&#39;ve always known, that first primer where &quot;on page three a dog appeared, on page five a ball&quot; and every familiar facet has been made to shimmer like the contours of a dream, &quot;the dog float[ing] into the sky to join the ball.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Faithful and Virtuous Night &lt;/i&gt;tells a single story but the parts are mutable, the great sweep of its narrative mysterious and fateful, heartbreaking and charged with wonder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
