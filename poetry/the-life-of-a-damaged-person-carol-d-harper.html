&lt;p&gt;The life of a damaged person was written to and be an example for others who start out in the way of a cocoon and develops into a mature beautiful butterfly. The process that was such a challenged of life experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thank Jesus Christ who pushed and encouraged me and coached me in my alone times/lonely, hurtful times. He encouraged me that I can make it through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give my photographer John Glasco from Dallas Texas; he did a dynamite job on my photo. Thanks a lot John.&lt;/p&gt;" />
