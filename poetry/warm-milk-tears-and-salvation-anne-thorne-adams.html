  <title>Warm Milk, Tears and Salvation - Anne Thorne Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I found out through my life you can not do it alone. My experience showed me that God and Jesus and the Holy spirit was holding my hand and wiping my tears through any tragedy I went through. Like all human beings, The Devil is so persistent in blocking faith by offering to give you the world. He CAN NOT do that. God created and owns the world. You have to tell the Devil to flee in the name of Jesus and he has to do it, be firm any time he starts messing over you or your family. 
My inspiration to write this book: I became inspired to write this Book, because it enables me to witness for my Lord Jesus Christ. It allows me to testify how great it is to have the confidence that Jesus death on the cross for me and my family, puts a song in my heart and joy in my life I will live eternal in Heaven with Father Son and Holy Spirit. I am going to be there." />
