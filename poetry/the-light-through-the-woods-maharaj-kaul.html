  <title>The Light Through the Woods - Maharaj Kaul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In his second compilation of poetry, Kashmiri-American poet Maharaj Kaul explores the shimmering emptiness of modern life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the author of &lt;i&gt;Meditations On Time and Inclinations And Reality: The Search For The Absolut&lt;/i&gt;e comes an exciting new book of poetry, &lt;i&gt;The Light Through The Woods&lt;/i&gt;. In it the poet bemoans how modern man has sacrificed his inner freedom and natural joy in living by creating and believing in the present culture of materialism and technology. He believes that man is born with inner freedom, joy, grandeur, and grace but as he grows up the existing culture corrupts him to realize these powerful elements. He strongly urges man to spiritually reconnect with nature to regain his soul. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poems also celebrate the poets stunningly beautiful birthplace, Kashmir, India, and express his joy in reminiscing about his childhood there as well as his sadness as he contemplates the wastefulness of its political struggles and the tragic dispossession and diaspora of his people, Kashmiri Pandits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poems also reflect on the drama of human condition and the search of the human values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visionary collection of poems dreaming of man regaining his natural inner beauty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
