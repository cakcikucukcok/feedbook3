  <title>Elwayne’S Exhortations - Elwayne C. Stowe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Elwaynes Exhortations, the author, now ninety-three years old, places a generous serving of original poems, stories (stateside and overseas, Peace Corps and missionary), Bill-isms and online exhortations on the readers plate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything has a definite owned by the Lord Jesus flavor. But it is believed that the Christian bias will not spoil the meal for those of other persuasions who have an appetite for stories of growing up in Americas Great Depression and/ or of working in the Civilian Public Service program during World War II and/ or of serving overseas as a Peace Corps Volunteer (and later as a member of a Christian medical team in the same Islamic country) and/or of working as night and weekend manager in a small-city homeless shelter in Americas Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of his poems, the author says, Probably sometimes I stretch the boundaries of poetic license, but its fun. And I think Im getting the point across to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of his book, he says, My various writings represented here are about the only things of value that Ive accrued for bequeathing to anyone. The good news is: this bequest has, I believe, a lot more prayer accompanying it than usually accompanies bequests of material possessions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
