  <title>That We Too Free May Live - Dudley (CHRIS) Christian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thank you for taking a few moments of your time to look at my guide. Take its hand and come along one scene of life at a time, one past picture at a time, and one full indelible life lasting tattoo, like a branded number for a name. All we were left with as a peoples, a family, a race, a culture or even as a name you can help trace back that missing link, that cast away tribe, a blood or even a DNA connection. Yes, you could help us, and we All would be eternally grateful in our appreciation to YOU...    So you see, but do you understand, just how difficult a task, or such a search, is to us as we try to find our past? Think of losing all your identity for over 400 years and finally finding a word, a file, or a disc which shows a connection to your past... Would you walk by and ignore it or step into the fray as you searched for that scene where-from you perhaps DID come......?    So thank you for stopping to show a little interest.....~dnc" />
