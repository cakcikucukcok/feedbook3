      <meta name="description" content="Giving and reflection on lifes curves, and its ups and down, enables us to take ordinary everyday things and turn them into inspirations. Who wants to grovel in the mud, run through sharp thistles, and squeeze through the thorny hedges of life? Not me! I trust encouragement will be in multiplications of hope and abundant freedom of the I love living life people around you even when life sucks. Sharing brings us into a realm of happiness and joy. Use something from this book and pass it on, then add something new and fresh of you own. 
Blessed By God to Be a Blessing
You are blessed by God to be a blessing.
We receive power beyond ourselves
To do what we already know,
Its because in the beginning was the Word,
Speaking blessing upon blessing like snow.
We are blessed to be a blessing,
For Gods blessing became flesh and blood,
And moved into the neighborhood
To live among those he loves.
Remember how God spoke to Moses . . . 
Tell Aaron to give blessing to my land.
So he cried, The Lord bless you, protect you,
For his face radiates upon you with joy.
Paul passed on Gods grace to the Church,
His grace, his love, his communion now ours
To pass on to others around us.
Weve freely received, so let us freely give out.
God speaks blessing and still speaks 
From the beginning of time until the now,
So lets pass it on like Moses and Paul
Hes blessed us to be blessings galore.
Yes, were blessed by God to bless others.
