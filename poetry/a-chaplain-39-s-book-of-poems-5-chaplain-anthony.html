  <title>A Chaplain&#39;s Book of Poems #5 - Chaplain Anthony</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God Gives Me These Poems - They Are Like a Seed 
God gives me these poems, they are like a seed. 
They are written for all and any, that are in need. 
These poems answer a problem or situation for some. 
Yes! They are designed to help people, but not everyone. 
Each person has a challenge going on in their life. 
These circumstances can cause quarrels, heartaches and strife. 
Jesus didnt cause these, He came to give us abundant life. 
So when bad things happen, dont blame your husband or wife. 
Satan, the enemy, wants to make you miserable today. 
So its very important to watch what you think, do and say. 
Speak kind words, think pure thoughts, and do good deeds. 
And, when you are helping others dont be stingy, instead exceed. 
Remember God is watching, and He knows whats going on. 
In these days and times, we must remain strong. 
Its so good to know that this isnt all there is, or will be. 
As a Christian, hallelujah! We can look forward to heaven for eternity. 
Seeds as we all know, take time to sprout and mature. 
So these poems from me, will be available for evermore. 
They may not help you today, but they will help some. 
And, when I write what I am told, then my work is done.
