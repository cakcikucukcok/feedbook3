      <meta name="description" content="If you were like me, I was trying to find answers in all the wrong places.This book was written so you would not spend sleepless nights seeking to find answers to cope with everyday living. I know there are times when you want to shut off the lights, turn off the phone, and give up. Ive seen people pay thousands of dollars for advice and, afterwards, couldnt see the forest for the trees. We are going to put an end to low self-esteem and claim victory in our lives. You will get your breakthrough. My short stories and poems will take you on a journey to defeat the challenges and demands of life.Feel free to e-mail me at htpublications@aol.com and help me spread the good news about overcoming because &lt;B&gt;We Are More Than Conquerors. To God be the glory! 
But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love Him. (1 Cor 2:9) 
After reading this book, you will learn how to stand and not be caught off guard when the enemy comes into our camp to destroy. 
We Are More Than Conquerors is a collection of true personal parables gleaned from her life that illustrates moral truths. 
The book details negative experiences and turns them into positive examples of love. 
From her harrowing years of abuse to seeking justice in court, Trotter offers stories of the difficult moments in life. Each one is related to a biblical parable, such as Daniel in the lion&#39;&#39;s den, which shows how God helps people persevere and find the strength to tackle life&#39;&#39;s obstacles. 
Her words of encouragement and tales of hardship wrap the soul in a blanket of God&#39;&#39;s love" />
