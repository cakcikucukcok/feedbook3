  <title>In God’S Hands - gDial Collier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="IN GODS HANDS is a book of poetry that is designed to put you in a place where you can come into the presence of GOD.  The poetry does not stand-alone.  Poems in Chapter I are enhanced by a Bible verse that supports the essence of the poetry it accompanies.  
The poetry in Chapter II has a short narrative that prefaces each poem, detailing its origination.  I pray that you enjoy the poetry inside the covers of IN GODS HANDS, and that you find a Blessing in them.
==  ==  ==
Below is a sample of what you will find inside the covers of IN GODs HANDS
GOD LIVES     
Have you ever wondered
If GOD is anywhere
Just look into the mirror
And you will see him there.
GOD sits inside our hearts
And rests within our souls
He wells up in our laughter
And flows when tears unfold.
When we offer prayer to him
He smiles down heavenly
So if you ever wondered
GOD lives in you and me.
Philippians 4:13
I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me.
==  ==  == 
MY SPIRITUAL GIFT     
A Gift of Love for us to share   
To minister to those in need, with care
To understand the reason why
A gift was given to me and I
Hope and pray that I can do
What God entrusted me to
Share my Gift so others can see
What my God Really means to me.
1 Corinthians 7:7
For I would that all men were even as I myself.  But every man hath his proper gift of GOD, one after this manner, and another after that.
==  ==  ==
THE VISION   
God provide to me a vision for your people
Make me strong and obedient to your will
Adorn the manifestation of your vision
To be viewed from valleys and hills
And have your people respond to the vision
As you would have them to do
And we will be steadfast in your vision
And your people will be truer to you.
Lord make me an instrument of your vision
Strengthen me to observe and uphold
The vision you have given for your people
The vision your love has foretold.
Numbers 12:6
Then HE said, Hear now MY words, If there is a prophet among you, I, the LORD, make MYSELF known to him in a vision, I speak to him in a dream." />
