  <title>Emotional Trendz - Romeo Weeping</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emotional Trendz is a lifetime of uncertainty for Romeo Weeping. A tuff gruff style exemplifies a courageous man with the gifted mission. Romeo Weeping lives in the transition of everyday life. He is no more capable of controlling his emotion than he is driven to write. The following represent a lifetime of a thousand of literary pieces he has composed, it is here you will only begin to understand the why to Romeo Weeping. I would venture to guess that as much as we feel we understand this man, we are so very wrong. He writes not because he needs to, he writes to survive the turbulent world in which he attempts to understand. I&#39;m not sure after meeting him and editing his work that I understand more than the simple fact that he is compelled to appreciate what little he has controlled of. In his own way he understands better than most of us, and shares this with an honesty some people would just refuse to accept. I hope that he writes forever." />
