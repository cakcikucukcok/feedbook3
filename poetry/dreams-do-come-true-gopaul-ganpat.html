  <title>Dreams Do Come True - Gopaul Ganpat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My book entitled Dreams Do Come True is a collection of sonnets or poems that I wrote over a period of two years. I know of only one writer who has written something a little similar in style to this. His name is Richard Fish and the title of his book is Thoughts And Feelings.
My book is not for any special age group, but it is for anyone around the world who is involved in this kind of literature. It consists of twenty poems and it is mostly about romantic feelings I have for some special people.
Each poem is in the form of a sonnet, which consists of fourteen lines. This format was adapted originally by William Shakespeare from my studies of Romeo and Juliet, Hamlet and The Merchant of Venice.
These poems are for the serious poets. Those who can understand the true meaning behind every line in each poem. People who can actually feel the emotion I was experiencing as I penned each word. Those who are truly romantic at heart.
There is not much more to say except thanks to everyone who encouraged me to get my book published and to my teacher who taught me about the great writer William Shakespeare." />
