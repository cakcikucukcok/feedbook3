  <title>Now You Care - Di Brandt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;I&gt;Now You Care&lt;/I&gt;, her fifth collection of poetry, Di Brandt voices a passionate argument against environmental degradation and a plea for psychic transformation in our violent times. Tuned in to the toxic fallout of over-industrialization and war, these poems face the dark side of our postmodern climate with a language that doesn&#39;t give in. They tremble and shake, they rage against despair, they speak against death and wrestle with the fateful spirits of Armageddon to loosen their choke-hold on humanity. Perhaps we won&#39;t figure it out and the horizon is already on fire, and our best love will never be more than an approximation of regret, but grass still grows between the cement blocks of the sidewalk to &#39;grin of the wild.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
