  <title>A Happy Dreamer - Elissaveta Iordanova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Happy Dreamer grasps the beauty of the different places and events author Elissaveta Iordanova has experienced in the past fi fteen years. Her collection of poetry presents a very personal responsea palette of reactions, feelings, and thoughtsto her journey. She has long been fascinated by short poems and the brevity with which her innermost thoughts can be expressed. They fulfill her desire to share a small part of these places, to encourage others to see things differently, and to understand that sharing is connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her poems, inspired by haiku but not confined to the form, reflect her personal experiences with nature, dances of the heart, and happy dreams for the future. She views this as a way to choreograph images that are poetic canvases of places and people striving for meaningful lives. From poems that speak of the beauty of the sea crashing against the rocks to poems that speak of love found by the light of the moon and stars, A Happy Dreamer evokes the emotion and expectation of a journey to cherish for a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elissaveta Iordanovas poems capture small, fleeting moments with
haiku-like compression and delicacy.
