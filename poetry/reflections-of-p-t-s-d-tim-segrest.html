  <title>Reflections of P T S D - Tim Segrest</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;In my first book, Perfect Flaws, I wrote that the book was about nothing and something at the same time. However, in the past year or so, I have arrived at a different conclusion. I have seen many horrid things as a sniper in a Special Forces unit. The details are irrelevant here, there are some in the pages inside. I can honestly say that this book is about how a person, such as I, deals with PTSD and its expressive turmoil it plays inside our minds. It is, in my opinion, incurable and the phrase, &quot;get over it,&quot; should never be in the same conversation. I am not promoting poetry as the only means of self-healing. I am, more importantly, trying to encourage other veterans to do something to aide in healing themselves. It&#39;s hard work but one cannot rely on medications and outside influences to heal them. Just in combat, much of the time, you can only rely on yourself. You must want to live.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;I have dove deeper in this book to explore topics outside the combat zone. Topics assigned to me in college classes, as well as everyday life. I did this because we are not in combat anymore. Everyday problems blend into our past world, an avoidable part of living in society. But, through the same self-healing methodology, I feel you can tackle them as well. But then again, like I already said, you must want to.&lt;/P&gt;" />
