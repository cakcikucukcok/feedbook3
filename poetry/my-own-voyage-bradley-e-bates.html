  <title>My Own Voyage - Bradley E. Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Own Voyage details a path of life taken to help restore mental health situations. Now I can live as normal a life as I can. It covers meditation practice as a way of broadening my internal well being which also has helped improve how I relate to people, learn about folks through the process of psychology and experience, and hone my writing skills in such a way that I can say more with less words. This project has taken me years of development as the process of my life has experienced many swings in mood, but Ive been able to successfully live a life that I find acceptable since I respond to people not in the usual ways but with kindness and patience. I abhor yelling personalities but try and help those in my life who have that type of personality without acting hypocritically. I need to lessen the tension in my life so I practice meditation for my prayers, for my physical needs, and for my overall love of the human population." />
