  <title>Inner Sanctuary - Robert E. Shaffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert E. Shaffer has always been a poet, but it took some time for him to find his true voice. As a young man, he enlisted in the Army and served in Vietnam. He came home discouraged and disillusioned, which is when the words began to truly flow. What followed was a career working with youth, and his spirit soon soared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inner Sanctuary follows the crooked line of his life as he finds solace on the page. His collection delves into his own subconscious but also looks to the world around him. He recalls those who have gone before, embracing memories long since past. He, too, regards the seasonsof nature and of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He takes careful study of youthfulness and the magic found therein. He encourages adults to not lose their sense of wonder, no matter the age. Shaffer ponders over his family and the generations that will follow once he is gone. Finally, he tackles the darkness and terror of war. Despite moments of despair, his collection is one of universal hope, of interest to all who wish to live lives of happy satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
