  <title>The Soul of a Woman Through Joy and Pain - Anitra M. Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Look beyond the eyes and tell me what you see? I would like to take you on a journey to a womans soul. The poems I am sharing with you were written from personal experiences along with experiences from family and friends. I decided to share my poems with you because sometimes its good to know that you are not alone if you are going through heartache and pain. The joy is represented by the pictures to show that no matter what you are going through, you can always do something that makes you happy. Some poems will make you sad, but you will see its not the end. Each poem has a date to let you know when it was written. I hope you enjoy reading my poems. Thank you for your support." />
