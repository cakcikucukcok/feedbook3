&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;Hope is a powerful tool that creates fire within, which enables us not to concede defeats despite being ready to give up in our lives. I look at society as a whole and see how people are losing faith in intrinsic values and in their abilities to sustain anything the world throws at them. Each poem in this book is designed to help the struggling families, the couples on the verge of ugly divorces, the single mothers who are tirelessly working but struggling to support their children, the disobedient child who likes to be in company of outlaws, the dreamers who want to reach their optimum potential, the fathers who work multiple jobs to feed their families and still dont have a breakthrough, and for all everyday persons who are looking for a bridge to cross over the cliff. The poems in this book will help you on your daily life activities and will certainly lead you toward the Master of all circumstances, all dilemmas, and all impossible situations. God, the Almighty, has the power and the ability to strengthen, to heal, to give hope, and to give infinite life. I hope that the Holy Spirit can touch your life as you read, so that you can become better individuals, parents, children, friends, and leaders in your respective families and communities.&lt;/P&gt;
