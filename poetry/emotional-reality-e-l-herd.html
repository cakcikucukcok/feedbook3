  <title>Emotional Reality - E. L. Herd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like most typical girls, E. L. Herd dreamed of getting married and having a family. She succeeded, and although the marriage didnt work out, she was gifted with two wonderful sons. As a single parent, she faced many challenges and obstacles. It took a lot of courage, strength, and determination, and there were times when she suffered emotionally and physically.
With the appreciation, love, and support of her sons, E. L. discovered new talents she didnt know she possessed, one of them being poetry. Now, through the power of the pen, she shares some of her personal experiences in an effort to make other sufferers feel not so alone. Unity is a wonderful thing in life, and together, its possible to find eternal peace. 
In life its true that we face challenges, obstacles, and pressure. Emotional and physical sacrifices must be made but can be overcome through faith and the power of forgiveness. When life feels too challenging and it seems like there is no hope, E. L. offers the power of self-confidence and the realization that nothing is greater than the power of love." />
