  <title>Changing Moods - Jon M. Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born in Milaca, Minnesota and raised in Brainerd, MN, Jon M. Nelson is a seasoned writer from the heart. This is the first complete works of his poems, but not the first time he has been published. He has had a few select poems published in magazines and in newspapers for certain occasions. He has also received recognition and several awards for some of his works like &quot;Children Have Tomorrow: and &quot;I Am...&quot; He has been asked to write poems for weddings and other special occasions. He has served our great country in The U.S. Army since 1996 and
continues to serve to this day. He is currently stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He speaks from a soldiers point of view in several of his writings. Many of his works are based from real life experiences, while others are just random thoughts that seem to manifest from out of the blue. He hopes that his writing will inspire and influence others around the world that there is hope, and if we all put aside our petty differences, this world can be a better place. He is a combat veteran who has seen many places in
the world to include; Afghanistan, Egypt, Australia, Korea, and a majority of the United States.  He is currently working on his second book, which he hopes will be even more emotional, and heart felt." />
