  <title>Diary of a Diva - Yvette Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The content in this book is not pretty. These are raw, uncut, disturbing experiences, true thoughts, responses to random voices, and plots of revenge leading to my victory. This book was not written as a self-help manual. However, if you are one who is or has been hurt via life, love, or loss, perhaps these pages can offer you comfort in that you are not crazy and you are not alone. Life changes by the second. Change, adversity, dishonesty, and grief can plow into our well being like a steaming locomotive, but we can handle it. This book was my handle. It allowed me to cry, scream, destroy, and laugh back. I was able to fantasize and step out of myself to do things that would otherwise have me serving a life sentence. This book is not angry. It is honest. Perception is reality. This is mine. These words may move you to act rather than react. These words may empower those who feel powerless. These words may cause in depth self-realization and provide proof that God did not put us here to be miserable. The problem is that many of us have had problems establishing boundaries in our lives. Pain festers where boundaries are crossed. Draw your line and stand by it." />
