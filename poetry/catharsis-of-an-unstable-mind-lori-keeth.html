  <title>Catharsis of an Unstable Mind - Lori Keeth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Catharsis of an Unstable Mind is a book that contains my writings from about the 5th grade (when my parents divorced) to about 2003.  I wrote when I was manic or when I was depressed and even when I was drunk.  
It&#39;s like I couldn&#39;t sleep unless I got all those thoughts out of my head and then I could lay my head down and sleep.  I had kept my writings in a file all these years and when I had my nervous breakdown, my medications weren&#39;t working like they used to and I felt manic and pulled all the writings out to look over.  It was then I started to work on compiling my poems for publishing.  I feel like the title explains how I feel.  Putting this book together has helped me work through some issues and it gave me focus in such a confusing time.  I hope that maybe it will touch someone and they will seek help if they need it, for whatever reason (drugs,  alcohol or mental health).  And know this, you are not alone!" />
