  <title>Dreams, Drugs &amp; Gods - Rob Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This my second book is a gathering of all my dreams and also The Trial of
the Devil. Im pretty sure I was able to scrape every last shred of it off of the
webpage. Here in its condensed form should make for pretty good reading. I
hope you enjoy it as I have taken on the challenge of writing the impossible.
Yet our society is changing as it realizes that this war on drugs has taken its
toll on us and is slowly swinging back to a more open stance.. one of tolerance
and understanding. All these people who we shun could rejoin society again
and hold their heads high instead of being labelled a criminal. People who
have found pot to be a relief to their migraines and backaches. These same
people walk in a life of shadow.. sons and daughters relegated to the streets
and phobias of the global mind. We should be doing better than this. Defuse
this trait, decue its importance and maybe we fi nd utopia by accident. Portugal
has already done this and the success rate has been phenomenal. What will it
take for everyone to come on board with this mindset?" />
