There are always obstacles that interfere with plans and desires but we tend to manage them, especially as we attempt to achieve or goals in life. , This book is dedicated to Wilbur Chambers, who celebrated his one hundredth birthday on June 28, 2013; He certainly faced many challenges as he made it to the century mark as a successful teacher, artist and friend. . It is also dedicated to my friend Nelson Rivera who managed to overcome many problems on his way to become a very successful bilingual teacher. We have all watched those birds in our gardens and generally we have wished them well." />
