  <title>Poetry of a Common Man - Armin Boko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Included in the anthology are previously published poems contained within SECTOR#7 and of Ares and Men, also Sketches and Reflections of 2012. This covers in full the poetic output of the author since 2009.
The overall design is a deliberate step away from the abstract modern poetry preoccupied with syllabic dissection and abstract notions to the intentional exclusion of tangible subjects. Modern poetry isnt supposed to make sense, were told, and it is more a play with words and sounds. The free-flowing style here, whilst of variable meter, does no more than serve the purpose. Substance rule over style first and last. It is how it used be before modernists turned it on the head.
In this book, preoccupation is with here and now; real people in all kinds of predicament and lifelike situations. It will be instantly recognized. It comes down on sham democracy, war mongers, banksters, and other vermin. Spared is none, least of all the author himself. His sporting inadequacies exposed for one should tickle the funny bone. Above all, the book is an antiwar crusade. On second level, it is on side of those creating the wealth, not those cashing in on the fat spoils. It is poetry of the common man in the street. Enough for young and old and young at heart" />
