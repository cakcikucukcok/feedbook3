  <title>The Poems of T. S. Eliot: Volume II - T. S. Eliot, Christopher Ricks, Jim McCue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second volume of the first paperback edition of &lt;i&gt;The Poems of T. S. Eliot&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This two-volume critical edition of T. S. Eliot&#39;s poems establishes a new text of the &lt;i&gt;Collected Poems 1909-1962&lt;/i&gt;, rectifying accidental omissions and errors that have crept in during the century since Eliot&#39;s astonishing debut, &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock.&quot; In addition to the masterpieces, &lt;i&gt;The Poems of T. S. Eliot&lt;/i&gt; contains the poems of Eliot&#39;s youth, which were rediscovered only decades later; poems that circulated privately during his lifetime; and love poems from his final years, written for his wife, Valerie. Calling upon Eliot&#39;s critical writings as well as his drafts, letters, and other original materials, Christopher Ricks and Jim McCue have provided a commentary that illuminates the imaginative life of each poem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the collected and uncollected poems of the first volume, this second volume opens with the two books of verse of other kinds that Eliot issued: the children&#39;s verse of &lt;i&gt;Old Possum&#39;s Book of Practical Cats&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Anabasis&lt;/i&gt;, his translation of St.-John Perse&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Anabase&lt;/i&gt;. This volume then gathers the verses that Eliot contributed to the learnedly lighthearted exchanges of &lt;i&gt;Noctes Binanianæ&lt;/i&gt;, and others that he wrote off-the-cuff or for intimate friends. Each of these sections is accompanied by its own commentary. Finally, pertaining to the entire edition, there is a comprehensive textual history that contains not only variants from all known drafts and the many printings but also extended passages amounting to hundreds of lines of compelling verse.&lt;/p&gt;" />
