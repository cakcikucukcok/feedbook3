  <title>Verse, Metre and Rhyme for Your Quiet Time - Jim Strickland, Jim Strickland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jim was born in England and grew up in South Africa. He trained as a mechanical engineer in England and Canada and returned to RSA in 1974 where he was employed by Eskom for 16 years 
He married Phyllida, a Cape Town girl in 1981. Since then, they have lived in several places in RSA, initially for Eskom before retiring in 1990 on the grounds of poor health. After this, they pursued their Christian call in Middelburg, Worcester, Fish Hoek, Weltevreden Park and Randburg. 
Their connections with various churches include Bryanston Baptist Fellowship (now known as New Covenant Fellowship), Rhema Randburg, Ermelo Christian Fellowship, the Methodist Church of SA in: 1) Middelburg, 2) Worcester, 3) Fish Hoek and 4) Weltevreden Park. They also served the Lord in Weltevreden Chapel, Oak Tree Fellowship and Riversong Family Church. (RFC). In RFC, they were lead elders from 2008 to 2010 when they retired. 
Jims passion has been Bible teaching. He has concentrated on Survey reading in order to help ordinary men and women gain a better understanding of the Scriptures. 
He has assisted Phyllida in presenting her course, Hearing from God in various places in RSA. This was done to help ordinary Christian men and women become more confident in hearing God for themselves rather than through others. 
For the past 32 years, Jim has been a prophetic poet, taking Gods Word to others in verse and rhyme. He is largely self-taught, but attended Evening Bible School in Randburg in 1982. Jim and Phyllida are qualified as Local Preachers in the Methodist Church. They are also ordained ministers in World Christian Network. 
Jims ministry has been influenced by such men as Dr A W Tozer, Paris Riedhead, Gene Edwards, Derek Prins, Malcolm Smith and in particular David Pawson." />
