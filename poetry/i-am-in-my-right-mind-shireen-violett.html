  <title>”I Am” in “My Right Mind” - Shireen Violett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for all Spiritual Minded Beings who know and feel that there is something more on this great spiritual journey that is life.  It is written for anyone who has a zest for the unknown powers that we possess as a Collective Group of Divine Beings or as Individuals on this physical plane when we choose Love as our daily affirmation. 
When we choose Love over  Fear, we are empowered to create a world that is free from judgment of others to a place where we are compassionate with all that is created and we see only the beauty in our differences.  We know in our Hearts that all things are interconnected and one action causes a reaction in our daily lives.  
More importantly, this book is about Transformation and the Sacredness that we each carry within our being. Its message is Inspirational, Spiritual and Empowering for those who are open to positive awareness and Change. And finally, it is for those who realize that we co-create our reality everyday and were the only ones who can change it from within through Prayer, Meditation and Self Realization of who we are." />
