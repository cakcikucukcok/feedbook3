      <meta name="description" content="Adults have finally caught on to what children have always known  coloring is fun! But, more importantly for those of us in the grown-up world, coloring has been shown to be a stress reducer and a means of stimulating thought.

Pamela and Rita hope you derive as much enjoyment, relaxation and mental inspiration from the coloring pages and poetry in this book, as they received while creating it. As you color within the shapes and lines of each drawing, may the poetic musings shower your heart with color.
