  <title>Source &amp; Soul - Monty Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry is the expression of spiritual essence mixed with equal parts timing and human observation. It exists within each of us from the moment were poured into the bodies we ?ll and stays there our lifetime. It patiently waits until it matches with the experience needed for it to outwardly show. Poetry is in every part of us; it manifests in everything we do. Poetry is our speech, our cadence. Its the way we walk; the way we carry ourselves. Its in the sounds we make when we laugh and cry. Poetry is the unique story of ourselves, created by us, as we continually write it. Poetry is the source we use to tap into the universal energy that unifies every being living now and that ever has; our soul is the sacred part of us that connects us to it.
Asked as a young man if I would ever write a book of poetry with themes of modernism, awareness, observation and spirituality, I am not sure I would have comprehended the question. I know I would have understood the meaning of the question; its just that the concept would have been so foreign to me I wouldnt have known quite what to say. I would likely have dismissed the question as one that had been intended for someone else. As the man I am now, I realize I could not have written this book today unless I was also the man I was then. Asked if I have now written a book of poetry with those same themes, I would answer yes, I have been writing it all along." />
