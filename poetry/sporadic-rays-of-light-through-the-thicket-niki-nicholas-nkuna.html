  <title>Sporadic Rays of Light Through the Thicket - Niki Nicholas Nkuna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The poems in this book capture the poets inclination to talk matters of decorum in all chance encounters. He resents misdemeanor of any kind. Writing poetry presents him with the opportunity to discredit misdemeanor and get satisfaction due to dearth of debate.
Through poetry and other writings, hes tirelessly endeavoring to highlight and discredit misdemeanor and proffer valuable ideas about a variety of issues that affect people in general. Theres also an obvious sense and trace of spiritual conviction in the sporadic rays through the thicket of life. This poetry collection would obviously serve as a motivating tool to the reader. It contains valuable lessons about life, mostly about the dos and donts, what is right or wrong, the beauty and ugliness of life, in things and people.
Conspicuous by title are poems like, Change, which talks about the inevitability of change, and Only God Knows, which tells you not to agonise about tomorrow, rather worry about the now (God will take care of tomorrow, for Hes the only one that knows what tomorrow holds for us and what will happen). After All Thats What She Would Want from Me is a poem of encouragement to help people overcome grief about a loved one who has passed on.
The rays are plenty in this book. Use them to illuminate your way through the thicket of life." />
