  <title>Dreamcatcher - R.R. Pravin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DREAMCATCHER is an anthology of poems written in honour of all the children and their families with life-limiting and life-threatening illnesses. These poems pay homage to the wonderful children and families I met during my clinical rotations across the world from Canada to the United Kingdom and Singapore in Paediatric Complex Care and Paediatric Palliative Care departments over the past year. They have taught me that there is light even in the darkest of times if one remembers to turn on the light. Like its predecessor Caught in the Mo(u)rning Rain, this collection aims to celebrate and appreciate life, pay tribute to the children we have lost, empower families and reach out to those who need a comforting word or two. There is a poem in here for anyone who needs one. Ive always believed that anything is possible if you believe in your dreams. In this compilation youll find my dreams for a better and brighter tomorrow for these wonderful children and their amazing families.
Pravins poetry is therapeutic, giving voice to the bravest of souls while providing a catharsis for loss and grief. Deeply personal, Dreamcatcher is a breathtaking collection of poems dedicated to all the chronically or terminally ill children. This is an exquisite and tenderhearted read.
 The US Review of Books 
Bravery in the face of tragedy, love in the midst of pain, skepticism locking horns with desperate hope - these poems show polar opposites precariously balanced on the whims of an ailment that goes its own way, regardless of the lives it breaks or uplifts. I encourage readers to find a poem or a story that they can hold close to their heart: there are plenty here, all testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Recommended.
