  <title>A Walk in the Garden of My Spirit - Lucian A. Tower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I began writing song lyric, then came
poetry, and short stories some 40-
years-ago when I was 10-years-old.
During the sixties in high school,
I had the privilege of meeting The
Poet Laureate of the United States,
Mr. Robert Frost. He spoke with me
discussing my poetry and my ideas. He
told me to keep writing and reading,
and as I continued I would learn so
much more and eventually become a
published poet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have continued writing lyrics, poetry, and short stories. I am now
64-years old and I am published. I have always told other poets and
writers to keep on writing, and learning about the many different styles
of the written arts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The way I see writing poetry is a likeness to a photograph of a moment,
a dream, a place, and a thing, a memory good or not so good. Life
comes at us in many different ways, sometimes in many different ways
at once. Its the situations that arise, the masks some people wear, the
way they talk and rub shoulders with everybody. These things make
up the poetry I write. When you sit down and look at life youll find its
much bigger than just us. This is poetry, lyric writing, short stories
from the imagination, journalism, and actually all the arts, they are
great love affairs with life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I have found all things good in the written arts, even when Im turned
down by an editor. Its all learning and enjoying what you do. So choose
a photograph of a moment, a dream, or a situation, and then write
about it. Create a picture with words of description. I live a simple life
as a Disabled Veteran of the U.S.M.C., and the Vietnam War. However,
I am simply who I am, and I dont try to say Im someone else. I am a
human being who loves the arts. My message to you all whom read this
is KEEP ON WRITING; KEEP ON KEEPING ON." />
