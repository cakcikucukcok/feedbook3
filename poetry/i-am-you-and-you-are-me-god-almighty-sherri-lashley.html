  <title>I Am You and You Are Me, God Almighty! - Sherri Lashley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I know who I Am and why I Am here: to restore the Glory that through the mockery of sin disappeared. I Am the translation of the Word given by the Creator of Divine power, igniting the fire of truth, illumination, and demonstration in this hour. There is a new moon, the morning sunlight in shining honor yet naked and transparent, confounding and confusing the lier of lies, which fly freely to and fro, choking the life out of the truth being told. Yet now it is time to show. To demonstrate the life of Christ, which cuts like a two-edged sword sharper than a knife yet spiritually precise to slay the slayer so swiftly. He is unable to detect me because he does not understand who or whose I Am. Thereby causing himself to bow down before me because I Am his worst destructionthat is who I Am.
	See, because this is not about me or you, or skill or intellect, or what we do or do not do. This is about discovering the power of the Father of love, who causes those who appeared to be weak, broke, poor and low to the ground to stand. Because the ability to be promoted and exalted by Almighty God is manifested by a supernatural hand.
	See, this wisdom does not come from the philosophical, psychological, professional and intellectual concept of Doctor Who. This wisdom is the natural supernatural ability to know all things freely given by the Father of love, Almighty God, Creator of the sun and the moon that stand alone, on their own, with no strings attached. Our being of one mind through Christ is so sweet and so smooth and so precise. And again, this enabling grace does not come from the training of man. This is simply who I Am.
	I Am one word, one way one day, one creation, one vast multidimensional manifestation. All knowing and all having, while unseen praisers honor me with continual clapping. Worship being the ultimate, intimate, struggle-free, precious pressure of power ignited against all of My enemies. While in this place of intimacy, the supernatural key unlocks the combustible explosion of My Eternal Glory. The fullness of Me. All at one time, I shine on all. All at one time, I cause the devices of trickery to fall. All at one time, I set captives free. I Am your light in shining honor, and your greatest discovery is your comprehension and/or your understanding that I Am you and you are Me, God Almighty." />
