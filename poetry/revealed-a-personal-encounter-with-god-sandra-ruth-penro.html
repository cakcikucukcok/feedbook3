  <title>Revealed: a Personal Encounter with God - Sandra Ruth Penro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Revealed is a collection of poems by Sandra Ruth Penro. These poems consist of scriptural acrostics, bible characters, childhood memories, and personal expressions of the emotions and trials of everyday living. This book of poems is the result of the authors personal conversation with God.
What is God&#39;s will for my life? Why am I on the outside looking in? Does the word of God really work? Do his blessings also apply to me? While peeking through a circle of her thumb and index finger, Sandra Penro declared, &quot;There has got to be a loop hole, a niche, a happy medium for me.&quot;
&quot;The secret things belong unto the Lord our God: but those things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of his law. &quot;
Deuteronomy 29:29
After God revealed this scripture to her, it changed her life. She realized that we do matter to God. He does want us to be happy. He does have a plan for our lives, and you should never give up on a dream: even if it&#39;s a childhood dream of writing poetry." />
