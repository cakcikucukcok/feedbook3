  <title>Everlasting Gestures - Buddy Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everlasting Gestures is a culmination of experiences and feelings that many may have once enjoyed or may long to enjoy. Each poem is filled with heartfelt warmth and desirable measures that will have readers envisioning themselves in the moment by the end of each read poem. The mantras played throughout the strength of each poem creates an atmosphere that readers will appreciate, capture and imitate not only for themselves, but for their lovers and loved ones alike. The mind-blowing words and profound gestures created by the author will leave readers staggering, yet clamoring for more. In Chocolate Lady the author speaks about a womans skin tone, which creates sensational sensual thoughts in the authors mind regarding the woman and his admirable pleasures of bliss with her in his creative imagination.  In Beautiful the author takes the reader to a care free zone where they can relax and release all of the stresses of everyday life, and in Ten Minutes the author takes the reader back to a night where an experience that lasted an eternity in the writers mind was culminated by recapturing the events in a ten minute time span before they depart from one another and in the writers mind, what may be forever. Buddy Hall brings you his perspective on romance, love, laughter, and the defining moments that most can only dream of in this book. The poems are intent on ensuring that the readers live the moment and embrace the feeling that is being expressed throughout every Everlasting Gesture. Everlasting Gestures will create an imagination in your mind or heighten your already imaginative thoughts and place you on a romantic high that you may have never imagined." />
