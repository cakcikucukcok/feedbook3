  <title>A Day Without You - Manish Kapoor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has gone through a range of emotions. It weaves through thoughts spun out from a beautiful dream. There are days full of unparalleled happiness filled with love and intensity. And then there are days with endless darkness which make shadows taller than our selves. Life is a journey and we all know that when one road ends, we find others that begin. 
Unforgettable memories are often etched on a moment. As the world spins, seasons go around bringing with them their own fragrance and melody. True love stands still as the world rushes on.  Love holds our hearts and souls together and provides us with solace in the comforting arms of an angel. In this life, there are only a few moments that hold each other and become a memory. In love we are often lost and within love we are born again. Love hurts, love heals. Love leaves so much for us to desire. And I am no different. I can wait endlessly for night to fade away, but I cant live a day, without you." />
