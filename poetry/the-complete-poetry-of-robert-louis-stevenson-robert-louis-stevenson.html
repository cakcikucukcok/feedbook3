  <title>The Complete Poetry of Robert Louis Stevenson - Robert Louis Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-1894) was a Scottish novelist, poet, essayist and travel writer, whose reputation came primarily from his novels and essays, including &quot;Treasure Island&quot; and &quot;The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&quot;. He is ranked among the 30 most translated authors in the world, ahead of Oscar Wilde and Edgar Allan Poe. Although his notoriety derives largely from his novels and essays, Stevenson produced a large collection of poetry that has been compared to that of William Ernest Henley and Rudyard Kipling. The principle object of most of his poetry is to capture a moment, be it a memory, an emotion, or some fleeting experience, and to draw his readers wholly into that moment. This is a complete collection of Stevenson&#39;s poetry, most of which deals with themes of childhood, friendship, travel, nostalgia and the sea, and includes his well-known &quot;Underwoods&quot; series." />
