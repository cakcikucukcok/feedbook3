  <title>Words at the Fault-Line of Faith and Science - J. D. Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Scientific discovery and subsequent engineering has provided this age with remarkable comfort and every conceivable gadget. It has also provided most folks with sophisticated means for personal entertainment, which keep them fully occupied. The time left over after our busyness for contemplation of deeper matters is very short, if at all. The questions, Who I am? and Why am I here? are not given much time. The poems of this book (some in rhyme, some in free verse) address these questions in short and focused musings that could prompt readers to devote more time to their deliberations about their destiny. The author is convinced that the revelations made by modern science and diligent Christian theology are wholly compatible and their juxtaposition in short verse is somewhat novel. Poetry is a very personal expression of ones thoughts, and your expressions will likely be different from those in this compilation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
