  <title>Flame Tree Road - Shona Patel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Teatime for the Firefly&lt;/em&gt; comes the story of a man with dreams of changing the world, who finds himself changed by love&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;1870s India. In a tiny village where society is ruled by a caste system and women are defined solely by marriage, young Biren Roy dreams of forging a new destiny. When his mother suffers the fate of widowhood–shunned by her loved ones and forced to live in solitary penance–Biren devotes his life to effecting change.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Biren&#39;s passionate spirit blossoms as wildly as the blazing flame trees of his homeland. With a law degree, he goes to work for the government to pioneer academic equality for girls. But in a place governed by age-old conventions, progress comes at a price, and soon Biren becomes a stranger among his own countrymen.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just when his vision for the future begins to look hopeless, he meets Maya, the independent-minded daughter of a local educator, and his soul is reignited. It is in her love that Biren finally finds his home, and in her heart that he finds the hope for a new world.&lt;/p&gt;
