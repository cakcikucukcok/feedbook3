  <title>The Judgment - D.J. Niko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;965 BCE&lt;BR&gt;Upon the death of his father, Solomon has been appointed king of the united monarchy of Israel and Judah and charged with building the Temple of the Lord in Jerusalem. He travels to Egypt to negotiate with Pharaoh Psusennes II for gold for the temple and to improve relations between the two nations. There he falls in love with the pharaoh&amp;#8217;s beautiful daughter, Nicaule, and the two kings agree to an arranged marriage. Against her will, for she loves another, Nicaule follows her new husband to Israel.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forty years later, Solomon&amp;#8217;s empire is on the verge of collapse. Power has made him arrogant, permissive, and blind to the scheming of his wife and one of his lieutenants to topple the united monarchy. As the king&amp;#8217;s faith falters and his people&amp;#8217;s morals collapse, enemies gather at the gates of Israel. A visit from a mysterious queen restores Solomon&amp;#8217;s perspective in time to save his soul&amp;#151;but it is too late to preserve his kingdom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Someone who once was loyal to King Solomon has come back to claim the crown of Israel&amp;#151;and tear Solomon&amp;#8217;s empire asunder.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
