      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A magical bloodline. A family curse. Can Connie break the spell before it shatters her future?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A bewitching novel of a New England history professor who must race against time to free her family from a curse, by Katherine Howe, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Physick Book of Deliverance Dane.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connie Goodwin is an expert on America&#39;s fractured past with witchcraft. A young, tenure-track professor in Boston, she&#39;s earned career success by studying the history of magic in colonial America--especially women&#39;s home recipes and medicines--and by exposing society&#39;s threats against women fluent in those skills. But beyond her studies, Connie harbors a secret: She is the direct descendant of a woman tried as a witch in Salem, an ancestor whose abilities were far more magical than the historical record shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a hint from her mother and clues from her research lead Connie to the shocking realization that her partner&#39;s life is in danger, she must race to solve the mystery behind a hundreds&#39;-years-long deadly curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flashing back through American history to the lives of certain supernaturally gifted women, &lt;i&gt;The Daughters of Temperance Hobbs&lt;/i&gt; affectingly reveals not only the special bond that unites one particular matriarchal line, but also explores the many challenges to women&#39;s survival across the decades--and the risks some women are forced to take to protect what they love most.&lt;/p&gt;" />
