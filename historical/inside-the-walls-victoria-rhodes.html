  <title>Inside the Walls - Victoria Rhodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is April 1892 in Polk County, Missouri, when a young man determined to escape his heritage sets out to find his calling and explore the world outside his Quaker community. Seventeen-year-old Daniel Frye is about to begin a journey away from his strict upbringing that leads him into the Oklahoma territory where his undeniable innocence and trusting nature soon sets the stage for unexpected hardships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daniels dream of becoming a news reporter becomes a reality when he is hired by the &lt;i&gt;Guthrie Weekly Press&lt;/i&gt; and is given the assignment of interviewing inmates at the local prison. His weekly column, Inside the Walls, entertains his readers with in-depth stories of the sordid lives of the outlaws that roam the territory during the rowdy days of cattle drives, bank robberies, and gunfights. But when Daniel becomes a victim of mistaken identity and is wrongly accused of a crime, he suddenly finds himself on the other side of the cell bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Daniel searches for purpose in his life, circumstances beyond his control force him to rely on his strong faith, family values, and most importantly, himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
