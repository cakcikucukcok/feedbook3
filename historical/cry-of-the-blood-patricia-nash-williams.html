  <title>Cry of the Blood - Patricia Nash-Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the mid 1800s legal immigrants entered the United States by the hundreds; the illegal slave trade flourished; and Native Americans discovered gold on their own lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1835, President Andrew Jackson signed an order that forcibly removed all Indians from their lands in Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, and the Carolinas; they were to be removed to the western frontier, leaving their homes and possessions behind. The order passed Congress by just one vote. Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Marshall objected; he demanded President Jackson rescind the order, but Jackson refused. In the spring of 1838, Jackson sent General Winfield Scott to Georgia with orders to build the stockades that would house the Indians awaiting their removal from the only land and life they had ever known. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first book in a planned trilogy, Cry of the Blood introduces an exciting and dramatic cast of characters beginning with the McCarrons from Australia, the Carvers from Germany, and the Kewahnees from West Africa. With its passions of love and hate, and agony and forgiveness, it offers a colorful adventure story put in a time frame of the early to mid 1800s in American history. &lt;/p&gt;" />
