  <title>Percival&#39;s Planet - Michael Byers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel of ambition and obsession centered on the race to discover Pluto in 1930, pitting an untrained Kansas farm boy against the greatest minds of Harvard at the run-down Lowell Observatory in Arizona &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1928, the boy who will discover Pluto, Clyde Tombaugh, is on the family farm, grinding a lens for his own telescope under the immense Kansas sky. In Flagstaff, Arizona, the staff of Lowell Observatory is about to resume the late Percival Lowell&#39;s interrupted search for Planet X. Meanwhile, the immensely rich heir to a chemical fortune has decided to go west to hunt for dinosaurs and in Cambridge, Massachussetts, the most beautiful girl in America is going slowly insane while her ex-heavyweight champion boyfriend stands by helplessly, desperate to do anything to keep her. Inspired by the true story of Tombaugh and set in the last gin-soaked months of the flapper era, &lt;i&gt;Percival&#39;s Planet&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of the intertwining lives of half a dozen dreamers, schemers, and madmen. Following Tombaugh&#39;s unlikely path from son of a farmer to discoverer of a planet, the novel touches on insanity, mathematics, music, astrophysics, boxing, dinosaur hunting, shipwrecks--and what happens when the greatest romance of your life is also the source of your life&#39;s greatest sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
