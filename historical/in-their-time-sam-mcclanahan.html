  <title>In Their Time - Sam McClanahan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Their Time revolves around the life and times of Harriet Arnold, mistress of Daffodil Hill. Tall, attractive, headstrong, auburn haired Harriet finds herself struggling to survive during the Union army&#39;s occupation of Murfreesboro, Tennessee. With her husband Edwin, away fighting under the command of Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, Harriet struggles to raise two teenage daughters and to protect her palatial home and property from Yankee soldiers who several time threaten to set her home ablaze. And if dealing with the Union soldiers were not enough, she also is forced to deal with Daffodil Hill&#39;s former revengeful overseer and a sex-crazed gambler bent on kidnapping her daughters and beautiful young house guests. Although this carefully researched, historically accurate novel brings a people, a place and a time alive again it goes beyond a portrayal of a particular people in a specific place while exploring the broader war, especially those battles that directly impacted Middle Tennessee. Although sorely tested, Harriet&#39;s early frontier training has prepared her well for the challenges she must face during the dark and difficult war years. Faced with events so shocking that she could never have imagined in her wildest dreams, Harriet somehow manages to courageously defend her household with grit and a fierce and indomitable spirit." />
