  <title>Escape from the Atomic Fallout - Capt. Gardner Martin Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author along with his wife and two young grandsons are stranded at his (almost bomb proof) hunting camp in Marion, Maine after a severe snow storm blocks the roads. 
Unknown to the fact that there has been a disaster and all are dead, the captain travels by snowshoes to investigate. Rather than join his neighbors in death he must get himself, his wife, and the two boys on a long and dangerous cruise. 
The spindrift spray slashed across the windows of the pilot house. The rugged boat built for such weather dove into the waves and up she rose higher and higher, then down to stop with a crash and shudder. 
Captain Kelley at the wheel watched the compass heading like a hawk keeping the vessel headed into the waves, was a must. If the boat rolled off course and got hit on the side by a wave it could be the end. The heavy ice coating aloft in the rigging would not allow a quick rise.
His tired eyes peered again at the compass and then looked ahead into the darkness. How anxiously he awaited daylight and the sun to melt off the ice from the rigging. 
What was he doing out here on the ocean in the winter storm? The answer to that question of course is the following interesting sea story: 
The Escape from the Atomic Fallout
The rugged sea captain with his wife and two young grandsons went on a visit to his Maine hunting camp in late November and are stranded by atomic bomb fallout. 
They must get from the frigid cold weather to the warmer climate further down south. The preparations and start in a boat must be made from Lubec, Maine to the east coast of North Carolina, near Cape Lookout Lighthouse." />
