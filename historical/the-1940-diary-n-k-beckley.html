  <title>The 1940 Diary - N. K. Beckley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book has been written for many of my friends and family especially Renee, Gwen, Bobbie, Susan, Toni, Jane Jean, Aunt Anna, Ruth Dixon, Aunt Manette, Paul, Fred, and especially my parents, Fred and Elizabeth. A large thank-you goes out to all my friends in Rose Valley, Pennsylvania, for without your help this book would have never been written.
A special thank-you goes out to all my students because you were a large part of this book. Some of the things in this book were actual experiences I had in my classroom, both as a student and as a teacher.
The names of the characters in this book have been changed to protect the real people either living or dead. 
There are two haunted housesone in Rose Valley and one in Wallingfordbut as for William, he is purely fiction.
I hope you will enjoy this book as much as I did writing it.
I hope my readers have had the time to read my other books: Peggy, The Three-Some: Book 2, The Writers Corner: Book 3, The Golden Nugget: Book 4, Emily (book 5), This Is As Good As It Gets (book 6), The 1940 Old Diary (book 7), and Pockets (book 8). Books 5, 6, 7, and 8 should be out very soon. They are all interactive books, and you can learn something from each one." />
