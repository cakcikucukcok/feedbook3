  <title>Aunt Jane&#39;s Nieces Abroad - L. Frank Baum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The follow-up to the smash hit Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces, Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces Abroad is the second in the series of ten novels that Wizard of Oz creator L. Frank Baum penned for young adults at the dawn of the twentieth century. This entry follows the travels of wacky baron John Merrick as he takes his three nieces on a grand tour of Europe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
L. Frank Baum (May 15, 1856 &amp;ndash; May 6, 1919) was an American author chiefly famous for his children&amp;#39;s books, particularly The Wonderful Wizard of Oz and its sequels. He wrote a total of 14 novels in the Oz series, plus 41 other novels, 83 short stories, over 200 poems, and at least 42 scripts. He made numerous attempts to bring his works to the stage and the nascent medium of film; the 1939 adaptation of the first Oz book would become a landmark of 20th century cinema. His works anticipated such century-later commonplaces as television, augmented reality, laptop computers (The Master Key), wireless telephones (Tik-Tok of Oz), women in high-risk and action-heavy occupations (Mary Louise in the Country), police corruption and false evidence (Phoebe Daring), and the ubiquity of advertising on clothing (Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces at Work)." />
