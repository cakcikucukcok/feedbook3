  <title>Which Way Did She Go? - Beth Perkovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the 1890s and Evie Logan is attempting to escape an arranged marriage to the arrogant and nasty William Douglas. A month after she dons a disguise, flees Philadelphia, and travels two thousand miles to begin anew as a chef in the Wild West, she has no idea that chance is about to lead her straight to a head-knocking encounter with Williams cousin, Jackson.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jackson, who is already aware William is offering a hefty reward for Evies return, quickly realizes her true identity. Intrigued by her red hair and natural beauty, Jackson offers her a chance to escape her lustful boss and become his personal cook. Seemingly left with no other choice, Evie accepts and begins a new chapter once again, this time in Ironton, where she and Jackson eventually stage a fake wedding in an effort to rid her of William once and for all. But there are just two little problems: William has not given up his pursuit of the feisty woman he intends to make his wife and Jackson is falling in love with Evie.&lt;p/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical romance, a rebellious young woman fleeing a marriage of convenience is led to a new destiny where she discovers that love always comes when one is least expecting it.&lt;p/&gt;" />
