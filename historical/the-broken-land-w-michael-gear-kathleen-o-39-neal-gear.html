  <title>The Broken Land - W. Michael Gear, Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A novel of North America&#39;s Forgotten Past &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twelve summers after the events of &lt;i&gt;The People of the Longhouse &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Dawn Country&lt;/i&gt;, the Iroquois nations remain locked in bitter warfare. Atotarho, the cannibal-sorcerer who leads the People of the Hills, schemes to set into motion a cataclysmic battle that threatens to destroy the Iroquoian world. His warriors spread fear and death wherever they go, taking captives and burning villages to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only five people are brave enough to challenge Atotarho. Odion, Wrass, Tutelo, Baji, and Zateri, kidnapped as children and sold into slavery, are now grown, and they have forged a desperate alliance that just might be strong enough to stop the madman. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odion, now a disgraced warrior known as Dekanawida or Sky Messenger, must convince his people that his visions of a great darkness will mean total destruction for all. His friend Wrass, who has become War Chief Hiyawento, and a powerful clan matron, Jigonsaseh, are his only hope. They must find a way to bring five warring nations together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning archaeologists and &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;USA Today &lt;/i&gt;bestselling authors Kathleen O&#39;Neal Gear and W. Michael Gear continue their retelling of the story of the Peacemaker, one of North America&#39;s most beautiful epics in &lt;i&gt;The Broken Land&lt;/i&gt;. Dekanawida&#39;s message of compassion and spiritual unity is as powerful today as it was six hundred years ago--perhaps even more so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
