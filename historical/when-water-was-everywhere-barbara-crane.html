  <title>When Water Was Everywhere - Barbara Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time in Los Angeles, water was everywhere--in rivers that rendered the vast plain a marsh; in underground streams that provided an abundance of water for people, cattle and crops. This is the lush landscape that the young Henry Scott encounters when he arrives, half-dead, in the pueblo of Los Angeles in 1843, during the waning days of Mexican rule. In this fertile place along the Los Angeles River, Scott&amp;#39;s fortunes begin to change. His story is intertwined with that of a wealthy rancher (inspired by the historical figure John Temple), whose kind will change life in California forever; a determined Tongva Indian woman, Big Headed Girl, whom Scott comes to love; and Padre Jos&amp;eacute;, a Franciscan friar who embodies the brutality of the mission system, yet tenderly cultivates the fragile beauty of his beloved passion flowers. As these stories unfold and converge, Barbara Crane&amp;#39;s precise and lyrical prose, and her deft weaving of historical fact and human drama, make for the richest of fictional tapestries--both epic and intimate in scale, infused with a sense of loss, but also with hard-won hope and the possibility of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
