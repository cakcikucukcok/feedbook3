          &lt;strong&gt;Even as Lady Polly rejected another proposal of marriage, her heart burned for the man she&#39;d rejected five years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d heard that in his misery, her beloved Lord Henry Marchnight had become a rogue and a gambler. But when he appeared before her on a deserted terrace and stole a kiss, Polly knew that her passion hadn&#39;t died. The man still knew how to steal her reason with one touch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But reason she needed as suspicions of criminal behavior hovered about Lord Henry. Should she return to her routine of spurning suitors? Or should she do what she should have done five years ago–trust her love and follow her heart…?&lt;/p&gt;
