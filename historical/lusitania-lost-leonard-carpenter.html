  <title>Lusitania Lost - Leonard Carpenter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Lusitania spy thriller&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lusitania Lost:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The author of the &lt;i&gt;Conan the Barbarian&lt;/i&gt; series turns his novelistic eye to real-life history of World War 1 in a “Titanic meets the Guns of August” spy thriller.
&lt;b&gt;A Lusitania spy thriller:&lt;/b&gt; History, romance, action. This is the final voyage of the Lusitania, the world&#39;s fastest luxury liner torpedoed by a German U-boat in the first year of the Great War. The story is told above and below decks, in the capitals and battlefields of Europe. We meet world leaders, the swank Broadway party set on shipboard, and the relentless submarine crew who fired the torpedo that launched America into war.
&lt;b&gt;Romance, intrigue and murder:&lt;/b&gt; Alma Brady is on the run from a New York mob boss. Desperate to escape Big Jim Hogan and his murderous gang, she joins a group of nurses bound for the Great War in Europe. Their ship is the Lusitania, the most celebrated luxury liner of 1915, with a passenger list of Broadway and Continental celebrities headed for certain doom. Aboard the Lusitania she meets Matthew Vane, a war correspondent who wants to find out what secret weapons may be hidden in the Lusitania cargo hold. During the one-week voyage, the characters are drawn into romance, intrigue and murder, culminating in a disaster whose full harrowing details have never been revealed in history or fiction.
&lt;b&gt;Lusitania horror and hope:&lt;/b&gt; Even with the threat of German U-boats and the too-recent Titanic disaster, who can guess that the passengers aboard Lusitania face dangers more horrifying than any on the war-torn battlefields across the Atlantic? Nor does Alma realize how relentlessly her past will pursue her. And, the lover she meets is a daredevil reporter intent on probing the Lusitania’s innermost secrets. His quest may lead them both into even greater peril, or give rise… just possibly… to hope." />
