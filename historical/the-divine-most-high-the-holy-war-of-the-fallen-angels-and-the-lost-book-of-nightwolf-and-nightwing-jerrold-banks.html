  <title>The Divine Most High:The Holy War of the Fallen Angels and the Lost Book of Nightwolf and Nightwing - Jerrold Banks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A poem of two Catholic priests that find themselves left behind as the Rapture takes place in a city that was taken over by giants. The world leaders unleash alien beings to lead the lost astray from knowing the truth.
Raphael and Elijah embark on an end-times journey, discovering hidden places and spiritual gifts that were kept away for a time such as this.
These two chosen vessels each have their own path that they follow. Raphael carries the gift of a lycan. His bloodline leads back to the hounds of God, a distinct supernatural race of werewolves led by God. Elijah, a new age prophet that has lucid visions and dreams, is visited by angels and demons.
The bottomless pit is opened up and releases ancient locust upon the earth that is led by the Angel Abaddon, who befriends Elijah.
Raphael and Elijah take on the roles of Batman and Robin and save the city in this end-times poem." />
