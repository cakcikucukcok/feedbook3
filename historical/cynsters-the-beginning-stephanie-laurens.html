  <title>Cynsters: The Beginning - Stephanie Laurens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Get the first three Cynster Novels in one boxed set from #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Stephanie Laurens! Fans of Regency-era historical romances with adventure and mystery will enjoy these stories of passionate alpha heroes and the ladies who bring them to their knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Devil&amp;#39;s Bride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Was he the husband of her dreams . . . or a devil in disguise? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Devil, Duke of St. Ives, and the most infamous member of the Cynster family, is caught in a compromising position with governess Honoria Wetherby, he astonishes the entire &lt;em&gt;ton&lt;/em&gt; by proposing marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Honoria, however, isn&amp;#39;t about to bend society&amp;#39;s demands and marry a man simply because they&amp;#39;d been discovered together unchaperoned. She craves adventure and longs to see the world&amp;#8212;and though she&amp;#39;s more than happy to assist Devil in solving the murder of a Cynster cousin, once the crime is put to rest she intends to bid Devil farewell forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she underestimates the seductive power of this daring, dangerous man and the scalding heat of her own unsated desire. Does she dare let passion carry her into Devil&amp;#39;s embrace . . . and into the most perilous adventure of all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Rake&amp;#39;s Vow&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He vowed he&amp;#39;d never marry &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vane Cynster knew the wind was blowing in a marrying direction. Other Cynster men might not mind stepping up to the altar, but Vane never wanted to be leg-shackled to any woman. Bellamy Hall seemed like the perfect place to temporarily hide from London&amp;#39;s husband-hunters. But when he encounters Patience Debbington, Vane realizes he&amp;#39;s met his match and soon he has more than seduction on his mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;She vowed no man would catch her &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patience wasn&amp;#39;t about to succumb to Vane&amp;#39;s attentions. Yes, his kisses left her dizzy and his caresses made her melt, but he was arrogant, presumptuous . . . and, despite his protests, bound to be unfaithful, just like every other man. Patience has promised herself that she will never become vulnerable to a broken heart. But is this one vow that was meant to be broken?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scandal&amp;#39;s Bride&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#34;He will father your children . . . &amp;#34;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Catriona Hennessy, Scottish Lady of the Vale, receives this prediction, she is aghast. How could she unite with a rake like Richard Cynster&amp;#8212;a masterful man with a scandalous reputation? More shocking still was her guardian&amp;#39;s will that decreed she and Richard be wed within a week! Though charmed by his commanding presence and wooed by his heated kisses, she would not&amp;#8212;could not&amp;#8212;give up her independence. So she forms a plan to get the heir she needs &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; taking wedding vows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard is just as stunned by the will&amp;#39;s command. Marriage hadn&amp;#39;t been on his agenda, but lately he&amp;#39;d been feeling rather restless. Perhaps taming the lady was just the challenge he needed. But can he have the rights of the marriage bed &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; making any revealing promises of love?&lt;/p&gt;" />
