      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sean Devaney takes his first breath in 1895 without any idea of the twists and turns his life will eventually take. As he grows up on a farm outside New York City, Sean learns that there is no substitute for character. It is only after he enters Columbia University that the rumblings of a World War begin in Europe, influencing the direction of Seans life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The day after his college graduation, Sean walks into a Marine Corps recruiting station, shakes destinys hand, and is soon transported to France where he must face death on a grand scale. Yet in the midst of the dark indescribable horrors of war, he finds a bright light in Lynn, a beautiful Red Cross nurse who seems destined to be his bride. But when tragedy intervenes and destroys his plans, Sean embarks on a revengeful journey with the power to destroy not only him, but also anyone else who crosses his path. As life comes full circle, Sean reflects on his life, with help from a new friend, as he contemplates the biggest decision he has ever had to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical saga, a young man struggles to finds himself through great adversity as a world war rages and teaches him the value of life, love, and loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
