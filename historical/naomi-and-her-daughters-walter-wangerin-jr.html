  <title>Naomi and Her Daughters - Walter Wangerin Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From master storyteller Walter Wangerin, Jr. comes this familiar biblical saga told in a fresh, transfixing way. You&amp;rsquo;ll feel you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard it before! Melding historical accuracy with imaginative detail, Wangerin uses the biblical books of Judges and Ruth to explore themes of love, faith, grief and community set against a backdrop of war and political instability. The widow Naomi grieves the deaths of her two adult sons after the shocking murder of a beloved adopted daughter, while pondering her responsibilities toward her Moabite daughters-in-law. Ancient Israel is in chaos. When her daughter-in-law, Ruth, begs to return to Israel with Naomi, events are set in motion that will change the course of history. But wait&amp;hellip;this isn&amp;rsquo;t the tame, flannel graph story you heard in Sunday School. In the tradition of Anita Diamant&amp;rsquo;s The Red Tent and Elissa Elliott&amp;rsquo;s Eve: A Novel of the First Woman, Wangerin imbues his tale with strong female characters and an earthy realism that gives the timeless Old Testament narrative so much power. You&amp;rsquo;ll find echoes of contemporary issues throughout: deceit, heartbreak, loss, war, and, of course, the power of love. Naomi&amp;rsquo;s combined strength and tenderness becomes the pivot upon which a nation turns; her decisions ultimately lead to the founding of the family lineage of Jesus Christ. Breathtaking descriptions, shocking violence, and inspirational courage make this spellbinding novel by a beloved award-winning author a story you won&amp;rsquo;t soon forget. It&amp;rsquo;s the perfect novel for your book group, and a satisfying read for those who love thoughtful biblical fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
