  <title>Counter Intelligence - Jim Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How did a baby-faced insurance agent wind up tracking Nazi Werewolf  saboteurs, leading raids behind enemy lines and wrecking havoc with the German war machine? Young Jimmie Miller saw World War II as a career opportunity and signed up for the Army Counter Intelligence Corps thinking he would ride out the war in style. Instead, he wound up fighting his way across North Africa, France, Germany and Austria. Along the way, he found adventure and the career he sought, but it came with endless nightmares and a deeply troubled soul.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book is inspired by whispered stories my father and his Counter Intelligence Corps buddies told each other. In the end, they took their secrets to the grave and I dont pretend this is an accurate account of WW II espionage but its a great story that covers many forgotten aspects of the war. The intrigue of North Africa, the southern D-Day invasion of France, raids on concentration camps, the recovery of stolen Jewish gold and the destruction of the Nazis last-ditch terrorist squads: these are the tales my father never told me." />
