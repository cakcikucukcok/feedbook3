  <title>The Lileth Gene - M. Cassol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vesna, a Serbian PhD student in Art History living in Tuscany, is a master rock climber. The only thing she can&#39;t get a grip on is her love life. Beset by terrifying panic attacks that strike every time she allows herself to be intimate with another woman, she strives to avoid the so-called mermaids in her life.  Olga is a widened-eye nurse trainee in Sarajevo. It’s 1912 and Olga is all too keen to document her life and the world changing around her in her diaries. Olga&#39;s passion for nursing is only rivalled by her love for her anguished boyfriend Gav. The arrival of the obscure Patient J.D. 347 at the hospital is about to change everything for Olga. Everything will change for Vesna too, when she meets the compelling art restorer Rafaella Guaritore. Rafaella holds the key to Vesna&#39;s research into influential women painters of the Renaissance and the metaphorical Lilith Gene that all the rebellious ladies in art are believed to share. Will Rafaella hold the key to solving Vesna&#39;s mysterious recurring dreams and find the root of all her anxiety? Or is the answer to Vesna&#39;s problems hidden in Olga&#39;s diaries?" />
