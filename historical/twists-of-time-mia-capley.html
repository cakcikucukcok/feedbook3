  Ashton Grayson is a prosperous computer analyst with a penchant for travel. For months he and Red Belle, his beloved old car, have traveled the highways and byways of the map looking for something he just can&#39;t seem to find until Red Belle stalls and a petite beauty named Sara McKenzie rescues him from disaster. 
  Sara has lived at Elizabeths Place for over a year but no one could consider the year a quiet and peaceful one. She has confronted mysteries throughout the house and on the acreage including the handsome ghost named William Alexander Cooper who has captured her heart as well as her imagination.
  Content with the addition of her new friend in her world of Crawdad, Sara never guessed that a bull with a zest for jumping fences could make twists of time in her life until she awakes one morning to find shes not in the twenty-first century anymore!" />
