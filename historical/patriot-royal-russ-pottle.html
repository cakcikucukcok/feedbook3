  <title>Patriot Royal - Russ Pottle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Patriot Royal takes you on a journey to the time of the American Revolution where you will relive the violent, miraculous birth of a nation as seen through the eyes of the representative central character -- Charles Royal -- who undergoes a personal revolution all his own. 
There are villains here as well as heroes; the bold, the occasionally bold, and the downright cowardly. And a few who will make you laugh right out loud. You will find love here -- unrequited and requited. Loyalty, betrayal, and redemption. 
There are formal set-piece military engagements involving thousands of soldiers in uniformed pageantry. There are bloody skirmishes too, and intensely personal battles that are waged within.
You will be expected to endure all the formidable allies of armed conflict: battle wounds, illness, starvation, bitter cold, blistering heat, loneliness and despair. You will meet the enemy, come to know him well -- but you will never learn to hate him.
Having said all this, you may be surprised to learn that this is not a tale of war, but of people. Some from the living past. Others imagined representatives of people whose lives and times beg for telling. They are all ready and anxiously waiting to escort you to a different, exciting, turbulent, history making, history shaping era. Let the journey begin" />
