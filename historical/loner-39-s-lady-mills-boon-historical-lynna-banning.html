          &lt;strong&gt;SHOULD SHE TRUST HIM?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a stranger turned up at her farm, in need of a place to rest, Ellen O&#39;Brian didn&#39;t have the heart to turn him away. He looked darkly dangerous, but she could handle herself; she had learned hard and fast when her husband upped and left.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jess Flint couldn&#39;t help but admire Ellen&#39;s courage and grit–even though he had to keep secrets from her. He showed her what it was like to feel like a woman again, to have a man to hold and rely on. With danger just around the corner, could their bond help them survive–or would his past tear them apart?&lt;/p&gt;
