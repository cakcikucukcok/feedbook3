  <title>If Ponies Rode Men - Sylvia Goodrum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Unable to find work in London in 1771, Samuel Daniels comes to America as an indentured servant to farmer Silas Weatherby. Although Weatherby is nothing but generous and kind, Samuel wants more in life than the lowly position of farmhand. But he will not repay Weatherbys kindness by breaking his agreement, and he stays on until his indenture is fulfilled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, rebellion rages through the colonies, and Samuel sees his chance to secure his future. He joins the Continental Army, and his fi rst day in camp
forms a friendship with a man named Spencer. A few days later, outside Hartford, Connecticut, he befriends a twelve-year-old orphan and forms another
lasting friendship. Th ough life as a soldier isnt what he thought it would be, Samuel savors his independence and earning his own income. But the reality of war intrudes as they struggle against the cold and the British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wounded at Saratoga, Samuel is cared for by the beautiful Mary Elizabethand
he cant help but fall in love with her. But she is promised to Samuels good
friend and fellow soldier, Jeptha Isaacson. Confused and tormented, Samuel
decides to return to his unit before he is fully healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark days lie ahead on the battlefield, and now, Samuel must fight for the birth
of a new nation, one where he will finally find true freedom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
