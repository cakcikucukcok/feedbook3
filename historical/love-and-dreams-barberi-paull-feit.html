&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Love and Dreams&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;by Barberi Paull Feit&lt;h3&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt; Love is a power. It can be elusive. And the characters of &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;LoveandDreams&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; are touchingly human. It is their reality as human beings  just as it is our own  to learn to protect the love they have and to respect its fragility. They are explorers who have set out on an expedition in search of love. They send us accounts of their discoveries, their experiences, and the creative solutions by which they have survived the adventure. They give the rest of us an advantage  they have alerted us. As a result, when we travel through that terrain, we will not lose time in finding our way or in bewilderment. We will not be slowed by a lack of courage, for they have given us guidance and inspiration.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;P align=left&gt;&lt;I&gt;Barberi Paull Feit has a view of the inner landscape, which is perceptive, profound and intelligent. She interprets what makes us human with sympathy and good humor. Throughout the many years of her practice in psychotherapy, thousands of patients have benefited from her insight and her vision. Now we have the advantage of sharing in her observations on the way of life and the way of love.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
			Mary-Leighton Land Smith&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt; In the story of &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;LoveandDreams&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;, the elegantly drawn characters filling the pages of the book are related by their privileged social circumstances. But their bond is not one of class. They are bound by their commitment to each other; by the responsibility they feel for each other - their love and their friendship.&lt;/P&gt;
 &lt;P align=left&gt; At the center of the story is Ogden Graves, a talented and complex man whose search for meaning takes him on an odyssey of years; Bandit and Charlotte Hutchins  charismatic, socially and professionally ambitious; Henley and Hayes Buchanan  renegade bluebloods whose genius keeps them on the edge of expulsion from The Social Register; Andy Morgan  scion of the Morgan dynasty in America, Alice Gonzalez  an impassioned and independent socialite, Vera Whitmore  quietly playing the role life had assigned her, and others.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=left&gt; I am confident that you will enjoy and learn from this book. It is both a compelling story of wonderfully multifaceted characters and a self-help book in the form of fiction to assist us  much more interestingly  in the struggle of understanding love.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P align=left&gt; &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;LoveandDreams&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; is published through our Illumina Imprint and by Xlibris. ISBN numbers: Hardcover #1-4134-0305-0; Paperback #1-4134-0304.&lt;/P&gt;
