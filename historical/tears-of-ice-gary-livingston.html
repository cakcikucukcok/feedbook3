  <title>Tears of  Ice - Gary Livingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;   Long before Hitler and the Holocaust, the Jews of Russia faced their own relentless terror from Czar Nicolas I thirty year (1825-1855) reign. His Rekruchina Decree of 1827 forced 60,000 Jewish children, some as young as ten years of age, into the Russian Imperial Army in hopes of erasing their Jewish religion.&lt;P&gt;   Tears of Ice is a poignant story following the forced conscription of twelve-year-old Poti Levin. Torn from his mothers arms by khappers, he was forced on a journey to a military camp in the eastern interior of Russia. This book delves into what happened to these boys along the route and when they arrived at the camps.&lt;P&gt;   Poti and the other boys are under the care of the brutal Sergeant Yuri Dominkov, a grizzled veteran of Russias many wars. On their long trip they are befriended by the story telling Private Gai Bosha. This is their story.&lt;P&gt;There have been many love stories,&lt;P&gt;but this is a story of love.&lt;/P&gt;" />
