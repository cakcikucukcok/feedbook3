  <title>The Balcony - Jane Delury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A &quot;breathtaking&quot; century-spanning portrait of the inhabitants of a French village  (Jennifer Egan), revealing the deception, despair, love, and longing beneath the calm surface of ordinary lives.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; What if our homes could tell the stories of others who lived there before us? Set in a small village near Paris, &lt;i&gt;The Balcony&lt;/i&gt; follows the inhabitants of a single estate-including a manor and a servants&#39; cottage-over the course of several generations, from the Belle v창poque to the present day, introducing us to a fascinating cast of characters. A young American au pair develops a crush on her brilliant employer. An ex-courtesan shocks the servants, a Jewish couple in hiding from the Gestapo attract the curiosity of the neighbors, and a housewife begins an affair while renovating her downstairs. Rich and poor, young and old, powerful and persecuted, all of these people are seeking something: meaning, love, a new beginning, or merely survival. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Throughout, cross-generational connections and troubled legacies haunt the same spaces, so that the rose garden, the forest pond, and the balcony off the manor&#39;s third floor bedroom become silent witnesses to a century of human drama.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In her debut, Jane Delury writes with masterful economy and profound wisdom about growing up, growing old, marriage, infidelity, motherhood - in other words, about life - weaving a gorgeous tapestry of relationships, life-altering choices, and fleeting moments across the frame of the twentieth century. A sumptuous narrative of place that burrows deep into individual lives to reveal hidden regrets, resentments, and desires, &lt;i&gt;The Balcony&lt;/i&gt; is brimming with compassion, natural beauty, and unmistakable humanity." />
