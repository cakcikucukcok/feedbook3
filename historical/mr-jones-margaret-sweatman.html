  <title>Mr. Jones - Margaret Sweatman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner, Margaret Laurence Award for Fiction&lt;br&gt;Shortlisted, McNally Robinson Book of the Year and Relit Award (Novel)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Award-winning author Margaret Sweatman has proven herself a virtuoso writer of historical fiction. Yet nothing she has written can prepare you for &lt;i&gt;Mr. Jones&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emmett Jones is adrift. Having firebombed civilians as a pilot during World War II, Emmett searches for something to cling to when life loses focus. Post-war, he becomes compulsively drawn to John Norfield, a former POW who has found his focus in communism.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set in a time of rampant paranoia, &lt;i&gt;Mr. Jones&lt;/i&gt; peels back the veneer of Canadian politics to reveal a nation willing to sacrifice its own. It is a fearful time, a time of &amp;#34;peace&amp;#34; at the onset of the nuclear age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Emmett&amp;#39;s existence comes under scrutiny. His relationship with Norfield makes him a target of security forces. His marriage, his job, even his child are the target of investigation. And as the nuclear arms race heats up, Mr. Jones sets himself on a path that will risk the lives of everyone he holds dear.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Evoking the classic works of le Carr&amp;#233; and Greene, Sweatman&amp;#39;s novel is a shattering exploration of a past where world governments threaten annihilation while training housewives in the proper techniques for sweeping up radioactive dust.&lt;/p&gt;" />
