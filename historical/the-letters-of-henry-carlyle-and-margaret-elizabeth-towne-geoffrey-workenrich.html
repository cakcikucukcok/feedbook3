  <title>The Letters of Henry Carlyle and Margaret Elizabeth Towne - Geoffrey Workenrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A man and a young woman meet at a boardinghouse in New York city. The year is 1873. Sharing similar wants and needs, they spend time together, engaging in honest and open discussions which provide for each of them both stimulation and revelation. Subsequently, they exchange letters. Through them, they record their hopes and dreams, their doubts and dilemmas, and too, events which contain both tragedy and death. An evolving and emotional bond is built that goes beyond what either of them could have imagined. 
This is the story of two people, the growth of their minds, the development of their personality and characters, and the opening and realization of opportunities for them. Though from different cultures and different backgrounds, different dispositions and expectations, they approach that harmony of mind and feeling, which, in human experience, is the ideal." />
