  <title>Malin and the Wolf Children - Skadi Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Germany 1945. A young girl finds herself alone in a vast forest, amid post-war turmoil. As the countryside is ravaged by the final clashes of retreating and advancing troops, Malin has one thought in mind: She must head east, to find her family. 
Winter is approaching and, as she begins the long trek, she encounters a group of Wolf Children, the orphans of Germany parents killed in the war. They have gone feral in the forest, scavenging for food and shelter in sub-zero conditions with barely enough clothes to protect them from the snow and ice. 
But who is Lubina, the strange young woman who accompanies a group of these children? Is she to be trusted? Many dangers, fears, loves and obsessions will both bind and divide them until journeys end. 
This is the second of Skadi Winters atmospheric and mysterious tales, set in the deep countryside of post-war Germany, amid a culture of ancient wisdom, the world of forest spirits, gods and superstitions." />
