  <title>The Last Casualty of the Great War - Gregory M. Galvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Alston quietly wonders what it is about his face that makes other people think he is someone else. Even though he looks nothing like his three siblings or anyone else in his family, in his eyes, he is just a normal middle-aged man trying to make his way in the world. But one day during a chance encounter with a German visitor at the World War I museum, everything changes.&lt;p&gt;
John is taken aback as he is introduced to a German man who shares the same features as him. It is as if he is peering into a mirror. Even more odd is that he shares the same first name with the man. After he eventually parts ways with the stranger and his family, John cannot shake his feelings of uneasinessespecially when he learns that his father has just received a letter in the mail, all penned in German. Inspired by the strange chain of events, John embarks on a quest to find answers that lead him to research his own family history, question everything he has ever known, and uncover a shocking truth.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Last Casualty of the Great War&lt;/i&gt; is the poignant tale of one mans journey through history as he attempts to discover his identity and the reality of his roots." />
