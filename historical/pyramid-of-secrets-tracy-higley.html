  <title>Pyramid of Secrets - Tracy Higley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Previously released as &lt;em&gt;City of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An unpredictable Pharaoh. An unprecedented pyramid. An unconscionable murder. When all the gods seem to be failing him, Grand Vizier Hemiunu must seek answers among a mysterious Egyptian sect who claim to worship only the One True God.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hemiunu, Pharaoh&amp;rsquo;s Grand Vizier, orders his life with justice, truth, and precision. In like manner he orders the unprecedented building project with which Pharaoh has entrusted him. But good order is about to be disrupted. When the Overseer of Constructions is found murdered in Pharaoh&#39;s slaughterhouse, a murderous spiral begins to unfurl around the pyramid. As the court swells with treachery and the body count rises, Hemiunu finds himself caught between his architectural legacy and his instinct for justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, troubling facts emerge linking Pharaoh&#39;s wife and the mysterious People of the One, a sect who &quot;worship only one god, whom they say has no name that man knows, yet is the only god, the creator of everything.&quot; When Hemiunu finds himself in the company of these strange people, his spiritual certainties begin to wither along with his professional dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As his long relationship with Pharaoh strains under the weight of his task and the tug of his conscience, Hemiunu faces a disturbing choice: follow the evolving spiritual philosophies that guide his life, or honor the Pharaoh whose friendship and nepotism control his fate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Higley gives readers a dose of biblical history set in King Nebuchadnezzar&amp;rsquo;s palatial gardens . . .&amp;nbsp;The author&amp;rsquo;s insights into a woman&amp;rsquo;s inner strength as she searches for the one true God will leave readers rejoicing.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;TOP PICK!
