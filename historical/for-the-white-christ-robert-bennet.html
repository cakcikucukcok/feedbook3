  <title>For the White Christ - Robert Bennet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Early of an April morning of the year 778, a broad-beamed Frisian trade-ship was drifting with the ebb-tide down the Seine estuary. Wrapped about by the morning vapors, the deeply laden little craft floated on the stream like a dreamship. The mists shut out all view of sky and land and sea. From the quarter-deck, the two men beside the steer-oar could scarcely see across the open cargo-heaped waist to where, gathered silently about the mast, a dozen or so drowsy sailors stood waiting for the morning breeze.&lt;br /&gt;
The remainder of the crew lay sprawled upon the casks and bales of merchandise, side by side with a score of Frankish warriors. All alike were heavy with drunken slumber. The shipmaster, a squat red-haired man of great girth, regarded the overcome wassailers with an indifferent eye; but the tall warrior beside him appeared far from pleased by the sight.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Is it so you rule your ship, Frisian?&amp;quot; he demanded. &amp;quot;You should have stopped the wassail by midnight. Here we swim on the treacherous sea, while our men lie in drunken stupor.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We are yet in the stream, lord count,&amp;quot; replied the shipmaster. &amp;quot;As to my Frisians, a dash of salt water will soon rouse them. If your landsmen are farther gone, what odds? Drunk or sober, they &amp;#39;ll be alike useless when we strike rough seas.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
