  <title>American Spirit - Roger Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stewart Andrew left Ireland for the Pennsylvania Colony with nothing but a few cobbler tools, a tattered Bible, and a dream. Despite many hardships, he and his descendants laid the foundation to make those dreams come true in the New World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His familys sons and daughters fought the Revolutionary War against the most powerful army on Earth, and two generations later refused to bow to their perception of a tyrannical Federal government that threatened to take away their newly found freedom during the Civil War. Stewarts dreams come full circle when his twin great-grandsons, Hiram and Martin, are faced with a heart wrenching dilemma: do they fight against the very country their ancestors established by supporting the Confederacy  or do they defend their families on the horrific home front in North Carolina?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Spirit&lt;/em&gt; tells the fascinating story of these early Americans through touching scenes of love, humor, sad farewells, and faith in God combined with action-packed and detailed descriptions of battles and home front dilemmas. Author &lt;strong&gt;Roger Smith&lt;/strong&gt; shares years of research along with maps, photographs, illustrations, and a detailed bibliography to create both a delightful story based on facts and a historically accurate portrait of a pivotal time in American history. In doing so, he poses an underlying, yet poignant question to the reader: Do the noble virtues our forefathers displayed in meeting the many challenges they faced still exist in American society today?&lt;/p&gt;" />
