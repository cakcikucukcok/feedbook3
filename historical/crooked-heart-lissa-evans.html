      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Paper Moon&lt;/em&gt; meets the Blitz in this original black comedy, set in World War II England, chronicling an unlikely alliance between a small time con artist and a young orphan evacuee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Noel Bostock&amp;#8212;aged ten, no family&amp;#8212;is evacuated from London to escape the Nazi bombardment, he lands in a suburb northwest of the city with Vera Sedge&amp;#8212;a thirty-six-year old widow drowning in debts and dependents. Always desperate for money, she&amp;#8217;s unscrupulous about how she gets it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noel&amp;#8217;s mourning his godmother Mattie, a former suffragette. Wise beyond his years, raised with a disdain for authority and an eclectic attitude toward education, he has little in common with other children and even less with the impulsive Vee, who hurtles from one self-made crisis to the next. The war&amp;#8217;s provided unprecedented opportunities for making money, but what Vee needs&amp;#8212;and what she&amp;#8217;s never had&amp;#8212;is a cool head and the ability to make a plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On her own, she&amp;#8217;s a disaster. With Noel, she&amp;#8217;s a team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, they cook up a scheme. Crisscrossing the bombed suburbs of London, Vee starts to make a profit and Noel begins to regain his interest in life. But there are plenty of other people making money out of the war&amp;#8212;and some of them are dangerous. Noel may have been moved to safety, but he isn&amp;#8217;t actually safe at all. . . .&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
