  <title>Strike of Venus - Rexford Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living in the Roman world of the fourth century could be very challenging. It was a time of change and danger. Barbarians were attacking the empire from all directions. At sea, no ship was safe from pirates. From the east, the Sasanian Empire from Persia was once more challenging the power of Rome. 
Even religion was changing. The new Christian religion was spreading throughout the empire. But which Christian beliefs were to be accepted? Constantine settled the problem by calling the Council of Nicaea. His mother, Helena, would contribute much to the new religion. 
The story is told by a large cast of characters that represent people from different backgrounds: soldiers, slaves, religious people, and beautiful women. The main character is Julia, the daughter of a retired Roman soldier whose estate in the south of Gaul produced grapes and olive oil. As a young girl, she got the Strike of Venus when playing the game of talus bones. This assured her of a charmed life. 
Then one day, she, her father, and her slave left by ship with wine for Constantines new city in the east. She met a handsome young officer of the Imperial Navy who was to protect her from pirates. 
Other characters include Antaios from Alexandria, who tried being a monk in Upper Egypt; Meirit, a beautiful Jewish woman who would steal his heart; Belisar the Manichaen, who fought the Sasanians; and Puglius, the slave, who would steal from his mistress, murder his family, and then become a Christian. 
Also included is how Helena found the tabulum, which was affixed to the cross of Jesus, and what she did with it. 
This and many more fascinating stories are included in the book." />
