  <title>Coronation of the White Rose - Vendens H. Pierre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Coronation of the White Rose is a story that follows my first novel. The true meaning of the story represents peace after the tragedy of the people in the spring town of Virgin Mary. The story also represents a new beginning at the end of an era. 
When Isabelwho is a mute rich blonde girlheard a bunch of rolling grains of precious stone making noise in the basement of her house on a dawn evening, she left her room and followed it to find out what it was. She discovered a bunch of rolling white pearls beads next to a white ballerina shoe with a long pink satin ribbon that holds the memories of a lost little girl. As she put her hand on the shoes ribbon, lightning strikes cast down from heaven through her dark vision, galloping horses hooves with heavy breaths and neighing noises, begging voices of a praying woman, and a sniffing noise of a crying little girl invaded her ears. She gasped and choked as she discovered a new world that evening. 
As she went to bed that night, she dreamed about a singing little girls shadow passing through the cathedrals stained glass windows in that town. The girl was singing and praying, and Isabel saw herself crowned as a new queen in front of the church. Without thought and doubt, she left the spring town of Virgin Mary in the morning to find out what her dream meant. And life arrived tracing its own path for her, used her as the gate of a new beginning, and crowned her as the new Madonna of the whole land. 
On the other side, wild, charming, and escape convict Badjo Badu was troubling the spring town and playing with the hearts of two beautiful women. Sandra Vedette, a beautiful, dark, fierce, mythical persona whom Badjo made a pact with to help her trace her way back to the flowering land, but instead of that, he found a girl in the spring town that he loved more: Anna Mariah, a beautiful Latina girl with long raven hair, red lips, and roses crowning her head, and gave all his attention to her instead of helping Vedette accomplish her mission. 
Read and find out about the game of these three lovely birds in the land of time." />
