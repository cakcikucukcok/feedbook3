  <title>Rust &amp; Stardust - T. Greenwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Greenwood&#39;s glowing dark ruby of a novel brilliantly transforms the true crime story that inspired Nabokov&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Lolita&lt;/i&gt;. Shatteringly original and eloquently written....So ferociously suspenseful, I found myself holding my breath.&quot; --Caroline Leavitt, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Pictures of You&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camden, NJ, 1948.  When 11 year-old Sally Horner steals a notebook from the local Woolworth&#39;s, she has no way of knowing that 52 year-old Frank LaSalle, fresh out of prison, is watching her, preparing to make his move. Accosting her outside the store, Frank convinces Sally that he&#39;s an FBI agent who can have her arrested in a minute--unless she does as he says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This chilling novel traces the next two harrowing years as Frank mentally and physically assaults Sally while the two of them travel westward from Camden to San Jose, forever altering not only her life, but the lives of her family, friends, and those she meets along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the experiences of real-life kidnapping victim Sally Horner and her captor, whose story shocked the nation and inspired Vladimir Nabokov to write his controversial and iconic &lt;i&gt;Lolita,&lt;/i&gt; this heart-pounding story by award-winning author T. Greenwood at last gives a voice to Sally herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
