  <title>The Lady and the Poet - Maeve Haran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set against the sumptuousness and intrigues of Queen Elizabeth I&#39;s court, this powerful novel reveals the untold love affair between the famous poet John Donne and Ann More, the passionate woman who, against all odds, became his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ann More, fiery and spirited daughter of the Mores of Loseley House in Surrey, came to London destined for a life at the court of Queen Elizabeth and an advantageous marriage. There she encountered John Donne, the darkly attractive young poet who was secretary to her uncle, the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. He was unlike any man she had ever met--angry, clever, witty, and in her eyes, insufferably arrogant and careless of women. Yet as they were thrown together, Donne opened Ann&#39;s eyes to a new world of passion and sensuality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But John Donne--Catholic by background in an age when it was deadly dangerous, tainted by an alluring hint of scandal--was the kind of man her status-conscious father distrusted and despised. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lady and the Poet &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of the forbidden love between one of our most admired poets and a girl who dared to rebel against her family and the conventions of her time. They gave up everything to be together and their love knew no bounds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
