  <title>A Prize for Princes - Rex Stout, John Gregory Betancourt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aline Solini--a beautiful Russian adventuress who has abandoned her Russian husband and is now in search of greater conquests in Europe--arrives in Marisi, in the decadent days on the eve of World War I. She has been rescued by Richard Stetton, the wealthy playboy son of an American millionaire, who is on a trip to Europe to discover himself. Instead, the somewhat dim-witted Stetton falls into Aline&#39;s clutches, and she uses him and his money to win her way into fashionable society. Once she is accepted by the elite, her schemes move her closer and closer to the throne. &quot;A Prize for Princes&quot; is a charming period piece, with a languid evocation of a long-lost Europe that will captivate fans of Stout&#39;s later works, as well as readers of historical novels." />
