  <title>Angus Wilson Mckinnon, a Confederate Soldier - Tom McKinnon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is based on the Civil War experiences of Private Angus Wilson McKinnon. Although he was from South Arkansas, he was sent to Virginia, where he was involved in virtually all the major battles. Angus was wounded at the Battle of Beaver Dam Creek, receiving a mini ball in the shoulder, which was never removed. 
This account seeks to give the view of the war from Anguss perspective. Historical documentation is rather sketchy. Since no one can know his specific feelings except for the actions he took, the author has fictionalized thoughts and words based on the true locations, battles, and his travels. One can only imagine the fear, excitement, and final disillusionment that Angus must have felt. True names of the individuals are cited, but again fictional tools are used to bring their personalities to life. Although this is a work of fiction, each chapter is preceded with corresponding historical accounts of the major events of the war, which were the settings of Anguss experiences." />
