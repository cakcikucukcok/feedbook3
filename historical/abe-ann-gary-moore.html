Homely and poor, but full of high ambition, the young Abraham Lincoln finds work in the village and courts the dazzling red-haired Ann Rutledge who comes into his life like a revelation.

Readers who enjoyed Doris Kearns Goodwin&amp;rsquo;s bestselling &lt;em&gt;Lincoln Team of Rivals&lt;/em&gt;, Steven Spielberg&amp;rsquo;s blockbuster film &lt;em&gt;Lincoln&lt;/em&gt;, and George Saunders&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Lincoln in the Bardo&lt;/em&gt; will marvel again at this very different and compelling tale of Lincoln as a young man. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Not a grand historical treatment but a lyrical telling of a deeply personal tale, &lt;em&gt;ABE AND ANN&lt;/em&gt; dares to give readers an earnest but untutored Lincoln whose humanity every reader can share, who was weak before he was strong, frightened before he was bold, and deeply in love with a woman who, despite their passionate encounters, would never be his&amp;hellip; or would she?&lt;/p&gt;" />
