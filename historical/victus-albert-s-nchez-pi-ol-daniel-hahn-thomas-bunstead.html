At 98, Mart&amp;#237; Zuvir&amp;#237;a ponders this question as he begins to tell the extraordinary tale of Catalonia and its annexation in 1714.

A prestigious military engineer in the early 1700s, he fought on both sides of the long War of the Spanish Succession between the Two Crowns&amp;#8212;France and Spain&amp;#8212;and aided an Allied enemy in resisting the consolidation of those two powers. Politically ambitious yet morally weak, Mart&amp;#237; carefully navigates a sea of Machiavellian intrigue, eventually rising to a position of power that he will use for his own mercenary ends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sweeping tale of heroism, treason, war, love, pride, and regret that culminates in the tragic fall of a legendary city, illustrated with battle diagrams, portraits of political figures, and priceless maps of the old city of Barcelona, &lt;em&gt;Victus&lt;/em&gt; is a magnificent literary achievement that is sure to be hailed as an instant classic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
