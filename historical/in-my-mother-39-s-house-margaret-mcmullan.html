  <title>In My Mother&#39;s House - Margaret McMullan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In My Mother&#39;s House&lt;/i&gt; is a beautiful, haunting, and elegantly crafted novel about a daughter&#39;s obsession to understand her mother&#39;s staunch commitment to silence about their family&#39;s experiences during World War II Vienna--and how they were able to escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told in alternating voices (Elizabeth and her mother Jenny), the story is remarkable for its fullness and rich details: the pieces of family silver the grandmother mails to the family, piece by piece, over the years; Jenny&#39;s war-time memories of her uncle&#39;s viola d&#39;amore lessons; the fragrant smell of the wood floors at the Hofzeile, the family&#39;s longstanding yellow home in Vienna.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Elizabeth begins to fill the gaps of Jenny&#39;s troubled memory, she stumbles upon a family secret that ultimately reveals how it is that we inherit the things we do, from one generation to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In My Mother&#39;s House&lt;/i&gt; is a poignant look at a family struggling to regain what took them generations to build and at what cost. It&#39;s an emotional, expertly told novel that proves that Margaret McMullan will soon join the ranks of writers such as Anita Shreve and Carol Shields.&lt;/p&gt;" />
