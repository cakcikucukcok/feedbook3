  <title>The Inheritance - Marianne Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Inheritance tells the story of a family disintegrating from conflicting loyalties in 1900 Calabria, Itlay. The region was subject to earthquakes and tsunamis; the land was harsh and poverty the norm. Superstition clashed with religion and a class system ruled the people. Calabria is the perfect backdrop for the tragedy the unfolds in &lt;i&gt;The Inheritance&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caterina is an atypical woman, and &lt;i&gt;The Inheritance&lt;/i&gt; chronicles her life from birth to young womanhood. Born with an inheritance of loss into a society that has predetermined what she can and cannot do, she vows to live a life of her choosing. Caterina refuses to allow the limits of her gender, the constraints of her class and the demands imposed by those in power to stand in her way. Caterina remains steadfast in her commitment to become the woman she imagines. Her decisions ignite conflicts and fuel a chain of events that result in dire consequences for all whose path she crosses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
