  <title>So Shines the Night - Tracy Higley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;In a city teetering at the brink of anarchy, Daria finds hope among people of The Way.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;She escaped a past of danger and found respite in beautiful Ephesus, a trading center on the Aegean coast, serving as tutor to Lucas, the wealthy merchant who rescued her.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;But the darkness she fled has caught up with her.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The high priests of Artemis once controlled the city, but a group of sorcerers are gaining power. And a strange group who call themselves followers of The Way further threaten the equilibrium. As Daria investigates Lucas’s exploits into the darker side of the city, her life is endangered, and she takes refuge in the strange group of believers. She’s drawn to Paul and his friends, even as she wrestles with their teachings.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When authorities imprison Lucas for a brutal crime, Daria wonders if even Paul’s God can save him. Then she uncovers a shocking secret that could change everything—Lucas’s fate, her position in his household, and the outcome of the tension between pagans and Christians. But only if she survives long enough to divulge what she knows.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“Meticulously-researched, spellbindingly written with luscious prose and compelling and complex characters.” —Tosca Lee, &lt;I&gt;New York Times&lt;/I&gt; best-selling author of &lt;I&gt;Havah: The Story of Eve&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
