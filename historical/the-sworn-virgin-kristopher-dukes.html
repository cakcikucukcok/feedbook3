  <title>The Sworn Virgin - Kristopher Dukes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dukes&#39;s gripping historical novel tells the tale of a desperate Albanian woman who will do whatever it takes to keep her independence and seize control of her future...even if it means swearing to remain a virgin for her entire life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When eighteen-year-old Eleanora&amp;#8217;s father is shot dead on the cobblestone streets of 1910 Albania, Eleanora must abandon her dream of studying art in Italy as she struggles to survive in a remote mountain village with her stepmother Meria.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Nearing starvation, Meria secretly sells Eleanora into marriage with the cruel heir of a powerful clan. Intent on keeping her freedom, Eleanora takes an oath to remain a virgin for the rest of her life&amp;#8212;a tradition that gives her the right to live as a man: she is now head of her household and can work for a living as well as carry a gun. Eleanora can also participate in the vengeful blood feuds that consume the mountain tribes, but she may not be killed&amp;#8212;unless she forsakes her vow, which she has no intention of ever doing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But when an injured stranger stumbles into her life, Eleanora nurses him back to health, saving his life&amp;#8212;yet risking her own as she falls in love with him...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s hard to believe that the culture Dukes describes was ever real, but the amount of research she put into this book definitely shines through.
