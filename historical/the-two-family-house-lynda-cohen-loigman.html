  <title>The Two-Family House - Lynda Cohen Loigman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;An emotional but dreamy novel that...will transport you far, far away from your next dreary Monday morning. You may do a lot of sobbing, but don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be smiling by the end.&quot; --Bustle, &quot;12 Spring Break Reads To Help You Escape Normal Life&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;**Buzzfeed, &quot;14 Of The Most Buzzed-About Books&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Popsugar, &quot;6 Books You Should Read&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A novel you won&#39;t be able to put down.&quot; --Diane Chamberlain, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brooklyn, 1947: In the midst of a blizzard, in a two-family brownstone, two babies are born, minutes apart. The mothers are sisters by marriage: dutiful, quiet Rose, who wants nothing more than to please her difficult husband; and warm, generous Helen, the exhausted mother of four rambunctious boys who seem to need her less and less each day. Raising their families side by side, supporting one another, Rose and Helen share an impenetrable bond forged before and during that dramatic winter night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the storm passes, life seems to return to normal; but as the years progress, small cracks start to appear and the once deep friendship between the two women begins to unravel. No one knows why, and no one can stop it. One misguided choice; one moment of tragedy. Heartbreak wars with happiness and almost, but not quite, wins. Moving and evocative, Lynda Cohen Loigman&#39;s debut novel &lt;i&gt;The Two-Family House&lt;/i&gt; is a heart-wrenching, gripping multigenerational story, woven around the deepest of secrets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
