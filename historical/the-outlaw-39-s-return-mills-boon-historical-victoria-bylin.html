  <title>The Outlaw&#39;s Return (Mills &amp; Boon Historical) - Victoria Bylin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Indulge your fantasies of delicious Regency Rakes, fierce Viking warriors and rugged Highlanders. Be swept away into a world of intense passion, lavish settings and romance that burns brightly through the centuries&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Victoria has a confession to make. She was driven to write romance by giant bugs and killer rabbits.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore,&quot; she says. &quot;My husband and sons would be camped in front of the television watching a movie about spiders the size of bowling balls, and I&#39;d be wondering when the handsome scientist would get around to kissing the spunky woman with the bug spray. When it didn&#39;t happen, I decided to write my own happy endings–without the giant bugs. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Victoria made that decision in January 1999 after a cross-country move from California, where she&#39;s ridden out earthquakes, to Virginia, where she and her family enjoy the history of Washington D. C. &quot;That move was difficult because it brought me face-to-face with regret,&quot; says Victoria. &quot;My husband and I both wish we had taken the kids to Yosemite or made another trip to Baja, but his career changed quickly and there wasn&#39;t time. As we made the long drive, I decided I didn&#39;t want any more empty dreams in my life. &quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For Victoria, that meant writing a book. As soon as she finished unpacking over a hundred cardboard boxes, she sat at her computer and wrote a sentence she considers to be the &quot;worst beginning ever. &quot; That manuscript is in a dusty box under the bed, but her second effort turned into Of Men and Angels, and she hasn&#39;t looked back. Writing takes up most of Victoria&#39;s free time, but she still enjoys an occasional giant-bug movie with her husband and two teenage sons. She&#39;s also &quot;mom&quot; to an elderly Chihuahua-corgi who barks too much.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;She enjoys hearing from readers. Email her at VictoriaBylin@aol. com.&lt;/em&gt;
