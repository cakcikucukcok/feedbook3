  <title>At the Back of the North Wind - George MacDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the Back of the North Wind is a children&amp;#39;s story about a good, sweet boy called Diamond who rides the North Wind as she travels her familiar routes. They do good and wreak havoc, though everything seems to work towards a happy end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George MacDonald (10 December 1824 &amp;ndash; 18 September 1905) was a Scottish author, poet and Christian minister. He was a pioneering figure in the field of fantasy literature and the mentor of fellow writer Lewis Carroll. His writings have been cited as a major literary influence by many notable authors, including W. H. Auden, C. S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, Walter de la Mare, E. Nesbit, and Madeleine L&amp;#39;Engle. C. S. Lewis wrote that he regarded MacDonald as his &amp;quot;master&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Picking up a copy of Phantastes one day at a train-station bookstall, I began to read. A few hours later&amp;quot;, said Lewis, &amp;quot;I knew that I had crossed a great frontier.&amp;quot; G. K. Chesterton cited The Princess and the Goblin as a book that had &amp;quot;made a difference to my whole existence&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elizabeth Yates wrote of Sir Gibbie, &amp;quot;It moved me the way books did when, as a child, the great gates of literature began to open and first encounters with noble thoughts and utterances were unspeakably thrilling.&amp;quot;" />
