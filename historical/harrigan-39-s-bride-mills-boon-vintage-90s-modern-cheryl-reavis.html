          &lt;strong&gt;Abiah&#39;s Heart Waged A Battle Of Its Own&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Abiah Calder had always loved Thomas Harrigan. Always. But the war had contrived to make them enemies. Now that same war had bound them as man and wife. Yet did Thomas&#39; heart&#39;s desire truly match her own?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Thomas Harrigan found Abby dying in an abandoned house, he risked everything to see her safe. No matter that he was a Yankee captain and she a loyal Rebel. She was all that had been good and true in his life - and he would claim her as his own; and damn the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
