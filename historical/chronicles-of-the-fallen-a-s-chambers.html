  <title>Chronicles of the Fallen - A.S. Chambers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Andrew Chambers is a bit of recluse. He prefers the solitude of his peaceful farm in the middle of nowhere just outside of Chicago. But being invited to a convention for newly published books and authors is exciting. Though Chambers knows traveling to New York City could be a crazy and frightening journey, he embarks on the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his first day out and about in New York, Chambers follows a path his father and grandfather before him took. He finds himself in Central Park at the Chess Pavilion sitting across the table from Connor MacCarith, a former Chicago policeman. MacCarith was known as one of the bravest policeman of his time, and unfortunately, he paid dearly while breaking up a speakeasy in the late 1930s. Chambers wants to hear the story of this heros life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MacCarith begins his tale when he was only nineteen years old and change in one of the unruliest cities in Chicago. What follows is a narrative filled with adventure and interesting characters, sharing a chronicle of friendship, death, justice, and passion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
