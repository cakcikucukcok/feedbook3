  <title>My Interview with Beethoven - L.A. Hider Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Named one of Kirkus Reviews Best Indie Fiction of 2017! It&amp;#39;s 1826, and young Virginia newspaperman George Thompson leaves his unhappy past for Vienna, &amp;quot;the city of music.&amp;quot; His mission: interview the famous composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. But George wants more than an interview. He wants to get close to Beethoven because he&amp;#39;s been told the musical genius is his natural father. George also needs to know what his mother, Hannah Bekker, had meant to Beethoven. While Beethoven tells George of his rise to fame, his tragic deafness, and the women he loved and lost, George wonders about Beethoven&amp;#39;s intimate relationship with Hannah&amp;mdash;and how he is to confess his real reason for interviewing the moody composer. What transpires turns George&amp;#39;s life inside out, and forces Beethoven to reveal a disturbing, personal secret. Inspired by true events, &amp;quot;My Interview with Beethoven&amp;quot; is about a young man&amp;#39;s journey that leads him to right wrongs, find love in unexpected ways, and heal the deep wounds of those he touches.&lt;/p&gt;" />
