  <title>Revenge of the Rose - Nicole Galland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Welcome to a world of intrigue of the most intriguing kind, where emperors and popes desperately vie for power, even as their subjects and servants engage in behind-the-scenes machinations of their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Holy Roman Empire circa 1200 A.D.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Impoverished young knight Willem of Dole believed he would spend his life in rural Burgundy, struggling to provide for his widowed mother and younger sister, Lienor. And so it&#39;s with surprise&amp;#8212;and apprehension&amp;#8212;that he obeys a summons to the magnificent court of Konrad, Holy Roman Emperor, whose realm spans half of Europe. Willem&#39;s mischievous friend Jouglet, Konrad&#39;s favorite minstrel, is no doubt behind it somehow . . . but what&#39;s in it for Jouglet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court life is overwhelming to the idealistic young Willem, who is shocked by the behavior of his fellow knights, for whom chivalry is a mere game. Yet under Jouglet&#39;s witty, relentless tutelage, the na&amp;#239;ve knight quickly rises in Emperor Konrad&#39;s esteem&amp;#8212;until suddenly his sister, Lienor, becomes a prospect for the role of Empress. This unexpected elevation of the sibling &quot;nobodies&quot; delights Jouglet, but threatens three powerful&amp;#8212;and dangerous&amp;#8212;men at the court: the Emperor&#39;s brother, Cardinal Paul, who has in mind a different bride for Konrad; the Emperor&#39;s uncle, Alphonse, Count of Burgundy, who would keep secret certain things that only Willem can reveal; and most especially the Emperor&#39;s own steward Marcus, who is hopelessly in love with Konrad&#39;s cousin Imogen. For if Willem&#39;s star keeps rising, Imogen will be betrothed to the knight by royal decree&amp;#8212;and Willem&#39;s star will surely continue to rise, unless Marcus figures out a way to stop it. But that would entail outscheming clever Jouglet, ablest of schemers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gossip, secrets, and lies are the fuel of daily life in Konrad&#39;s court. As Konrad edges closer to proclaiming Lienor his bride, those around Willem play a perilous game of cat-and-mouse as they attempt to secure their own fortunes, knowing that even the slightest move can shift the playing field entirely. And through it all, Jouglet remains Willem&#39;s most maddening yet staunchest ally. But what, really, does Jouglet stand to gain . . . or lose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transporting the reader to the brilliant, conniving heart of the largest empire of medieval Europe, &lt;em&gt;Revenge of the Rose&lt;/em&gt; is a novel rich in irony and tongue-in-cheek wit, and reveals all the grit and color, politics and passion, of court life in the Holy Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
