  <title>Children of Paradise - Fred D&#39;aguiar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Acclaimed novelist, playwright, and poet Fred D&amp;#8217;Aguiar has been short-listed for the T.S. Eliot Prize in poetry for &lt;em&gt;Bill of Rights&lt;/em&gt;, his narrative poem about the Jonestown massacre, and won the Whitbread First Novel Award for &lt;em&gt;The Longest Memory&lt;/em&gt;. In this beautifully imagined work of literary fiction, he returns to the territory of Jim Jones&amp;#8217;s utopian commune, interweaving magical realism and shocking history into a resonant story of love, faith, oppression, and sacrifice in which a mother and daughter attempt to break free with the help of an extraordinary gorilla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joyce and her young daughter, Trina, are members of a utopian community ruled by a magnetic preacher. When Trina, plays too near to the cage holding the commune&amp;#8217;s gorilla, Adam, the ape attacks and kills the child. Or so everyone believes. That night, the preacher dramatically &amp;#8220;revives&amp;#8221; her&amp;#8212;an act that transforms Trina into a symbol of its charismatic leader&amp;#8217;s God-like power. Desperate to save her daughter from the preacher&amp;#8217;s control, the outspoken Joyce attempts a daring escape, a run for freedom aided by another prisoner&amp;#8212;the remarkable Adam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told with a sweeping perspective in lush prose, shimmering with magic, and devastating in its clarity, &lt;em&gt;Children of Paradise&lt;/em&gt; is a brilliant and evocative exploration of oppression&amp;#8212;of both mind and body&amp;#8212;and of the liberating power of storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
