  <title>The Gods of Venice - Alan J. Shannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout its history, enchanting and mysterious Venice has attracted seekers. Some travel to the city to experience its storied charms, while others look for something else. This is the story of vastly different seekers whose lives unexpectedly intersect over six decades in a city shrouded in mystery.&lt;p&gt; 
In the Venice of pre-WWII, Costanza, a talented baker, and her husband Piero Agostino, a glass blower, are blessed with a daughter, Breva. She is the love of their life until the waters of Venice snatch her from them. Bereaved, their lives are lost to them.&lt;p&gt;
In present-day Venice, Claudia Baggi, the diffident daughter of a countess, and Louis Howard, an unemployed expatriate from Chicago, have become good friends in the last year. Together, they concoct a plot that will allow Claudia to remain in Venice instead of returning home with her pious and controlling mother, Countess Baggi. Claudia and Louis restore a crumbling palazzo and convert it into a hotel. But the burning of the old La Fenice opera house triggers a series of unforeseeable events.&lt;p&gt;
In this saga of love and redemption, Claudia, Louis, Costanza, Piero, and the Countess come to realize that rebirth is possible from the ashes of devastation." />
