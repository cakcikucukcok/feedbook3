  <title>Hap and Hazard and the End of the World - Diane DeSanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;Diane DeSanders writes the sort of prose that gives that telltale tingle down the spine, prose that paints vivid pictures in the mind and presents an entire, unique world: the Lone Star State, the state of America, the state of childhood, the state of a traumatized father, and the state of being a girl, of being wonderfully and truly alive.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Sheila Kohler&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Becoming Jane Eyre&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Once We Were Sisters&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For Dick and Jane, Dallas after World War II is a place of promise and prosperity: the first home air conditioners are making summertime bearable and Dick&amp;#8217;s position at his father&amp;#8217;s business, the Cadillac dealership, is assured. Jane has help with the house and the children, and garden parties and holiday celebrations are spirited social affairs. For the oldest of their three daughters, however, life is full of frustrating mysteries. The stories the adults tell her don&amp;#8217;t make sense. Too curious for comfort, she finds her questions only seem to annoy them. Why won&amp;#8217;t they tell the truth about Santa? What is that Holy Spirit business, and what is the difference between an angel and a ghost? Why is her mother often so tense and sad? And why does her father keep flying into violent rages?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Hap and Hazard and the End of the World&lt;/I&gt; is an intimate, finely crafted novel about the innocence and vulnerability of childhood and the dangers posed by adults who cannot cope with life&amp;#8217;s complexities. It is also about the ingenuity born of loneliness and neglect, and the surprising, strange beauty of the world.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;br&gt;A fifth-generation Texan, &lt;B&gt;Diane DeSanders&lt;/B&gt; is a history buff, theater lover, poet, mother, and grandmother. Between careers as a history teacher and antiques dealer, she has worked in regional theater in almost every capacity. She now writes, gardens, and sings in Brooklyn, New York. This is her first novel.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
