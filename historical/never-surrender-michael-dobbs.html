  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Never Surrender - Michael Dobbs</i></b> | Michael Dobbs has a great imagination to envision the dialogue and feelings of players in Never Surrender. If you are a WWII buff, the Churchill series by Dobbs is a great read to understand the war from one of England's most well known Prime Minister.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Never Surrender: A Novel of Winston Churchill ...</i></b> | Never Surrender was an intelligent, perceptive novel which I thoroughly enjoyed. Dobbs really captured the atmosphere in London and France from Churchill’s appointment as Prime Minister to the fall of France. Dobbs also succeeded marvelously at capturing the complex, awesome personality of Churchill.<br /><b><i>Never Surrender (Winston Churchill, #2) by Michael Dobbs</i></b> | Winston's War.
