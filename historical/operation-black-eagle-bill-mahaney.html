  <title>Operation Black Eagle - Bill Mahaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is September, 1940, and the Battle of Britain is not going well for the Germans. The RAF Spitfire, powered with a high performance carburetor made with platinum parts, is outperforming the Messerschmitt. Gold and platinum, smuggled out of the Andes in 1939 by a German elite force, lies at the bottom of the Caribbean Sea off Margarita Island. Retrieval of this strategic ore will allow the Germans to refit their fighters with a new ignition system and reverse their declining fortunes. Adolph Hitler himself authorizes a mission, code named Black Eagle, to recover the sunken gold and platinum from the sea bottom and return it to Germany. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the aid of the IRA and an Irish marine recovery vessel and specialists, the German mission, comprising an armed tender and two U-boats, play a game of blind mans bluff with British and American forces, the Germans intent on recovering the sunken cargo, the Allies intent on stopping it.  Professor Jack Ford, a group of British commandoes and a patched-together Allied naval force of subs and surface craft are all that stand in the way of a successful German mission. The challenge on both sides is filled with twists of events making it uncertain who to trust and which way to turn.  Anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
