  <title>Song of the Red Sparrow, Book Two - Rory Shane Riggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;So much has happened in the twenty years following the Civil War, the most shocking event
to stun the country to date. As a young nation fights for survival and identity, its citizens seek their own purpose and understanding. In Prairie Gulch, a hidden town in Texas, what seems on the surface like the innocent arrival of four singers puts in motion a series of events that could alter history itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the young entertainers could be the key to unlocking a mystery a local myth discussed only in hushed tones that has captivated the attention of locals for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the puzzle begins to come together,
the townspeople may learn that some legends are better left unproven, and some secrets are better left buried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Song of the Red Sparrow Book Two&lt;/i&gt; is the second installment in a trilogy that traces an epic American story. From the end of the Civil War to a small, isolated frontier town in Texas two decades later, guarded secrets are about to be revealed, lives changed, loves lost  and history itself could be rewritten.&lt;/p&gt;" />
