&lt;p&gt;Inside a barn in a tiny Florida town, the last ?ght of the night is about to take place. Andy, a traveling prize ?ghter, enters the ring to jeers from onlookers.

No one is waiting to whisk him to safety. Andys life is about to change forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Andy is brutally beaten by an angry town mob that includes the local sheri? , he is unjustly jailed and sentenced to a work farm.

Against all reason, Andy and Oquilla fall in love and begin planning their escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way out is through foreboding and perilous swamps. As Andy and Oquilla em-bark on a dangerous journey to freedom, bounty hunters relentlessly pursue the couple. Only time will tell if Andy and Oquilla will be able to outrun an evil sheri? and his lackeys.&lt;/p&gt;" />
