  <title>A Logger&#39;s Dream - Richard Etheredge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aging logger Daniel Hobgood looks back on a life lived in pursuit of a dream. Born the son of a struggling pulpwooder, he fought against the odds to rise above the path that folks thought he ought to follow. Always looking for a better way, young Daniel&#39;s thinking was always outside the box. He would try any idea that would help him in pursuit of his dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life in post-World War II Alabama was a time of hard work, poverty, sorrow, humor, and joy. The church is a big part of the culture, providing the backdrop against which lives were lived. Daniel&#39;s life is no exception. Work, church, coon hunting, and family are all he knows. The more he learns, the more he realizes he has yet to learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did Daniel achieve his dream? Was the dream worth the struggle? If you have ever had a dream, join Daniel as he remembers his six decades of living &lt;I&gt;A Logger&#39;s Dream&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
