The magazine where Willa worked has folded; the college where her husband had tenure has closed. Their dubious shelter is also the only option for a disabled father-in-law and an exasperating, free-spirited daughter. When the family&amp;#8217;s one success story, an Ivy-educated son, is uprooted by tragedy he seems likely to join them, with dark complications of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another time, a troubled husband and public servant asks, &lt;em&gt;How can a man tell the truth, and be reviled for it?&lt;/em&gt; A science teacher with a passion for honest investigation, Thatcher Greenwood finds himself under siege: his employer forbids him to speak of the exciting work just published by Charles Darwin. His young bride and social-climbing mother-in-law bristle at the risk of scandal, and dismiss his worries that their elegant house is unsound. In a village ostensibly founded as a benevolent Utopia, Thatcher wants only to honor his duties, but his friendships with a woman scientist and a renegade newspaper editor threaten to draw him into a vendetta with the town&amp;#8217;s powerful men.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unsheltered&lt;/em&gt; is the compulsively readable story of two families, in two centuries, who live at the corner of Sixth and Plum in Vineland, New Jersey, navigating what seems to be the end of the world as they know it. With history as their tantalizing canvas, these characters paint a startlingly relevant portrait of life in precarious times when the foundations of the past have failed to prepare us for the future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
