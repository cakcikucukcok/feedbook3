  <title>The House of Many Windows - John Robert Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is a mastermind?  The House of Many Windows is a story of one man&#39;s life and his journey to become a millionaire.  Wallace Paine was born in the late 1800s.  His grandmother led a psychotic life that ultimately affected the entire family. From Wallace&#39;s early childhood to his death in 1919, he maneuvered his way at a young age into owning a newspaper company called the Weekly Page.  He had a keen way of working with Eastman Kodak Company, Ford Motor Company, Standard Optical Company, and founded the first Wire Wheel Company.  Being impressed with Frank Lloyd Wright, Wallace built a prototype prairie style home in the Finger Lakes Region of New York State.  Wallace used his sociopathic personality to have those around him enter into sex, deceit, greed, murders, and wealth.  From the shooting of President William McKinley at the Pan-American Exposition in 1901 to the last years of Mr. Paine&#39;s life in the Finger Lakes, The House of Many Windows is a glimpse into the corrupt business dealings in the Orient to life in a small city.  Architecture, money, and dishonesty drive the characters to his unknown past when Wallace Paine suddenly dies of pneumonia shortly after the 1918 influenza epidemic." />
