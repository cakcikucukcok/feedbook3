  <title>Hooman - Fereidoun “Farley” Gharagozlou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At first, the people of Ariana were little more than nomads with a few tricks for continuing their survival. Eventually, however, they developed agriculture and began to settle down, advancing as a society. As they progressed from small farming communities into a thriving civilization, they evolved in other ways as well. They developed a military composed of professional soldiers and a written language to act as a medium for complex messages. In this predecessor of ancient Persia, three generations of rulers fostered this change, beginning with a man called Hooman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a son of an influential family, Hooman started at the bottom and rose to greatness, advancing to the rank of general at a surprising rate. Even so, he is surprised to find himself crowned successor to the throne of Ariana. A man of genuine character and remarkable kindness, he seemed the best choice. But can he handle this much responsibility? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A young man, Hooman is only learning the ways of the world.  He must navigate love, hate, tradition and deceit all within the boundaries of his culture.  He must embrace tragedy and hold happiness at bay in order to become the man who can lead and protect a fledgling nation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
