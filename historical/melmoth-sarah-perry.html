In Prague, working as a translator, she has found a home of sorts&amp;#8212;or, at least, refuge. That changes when her friend Karel discovers a mysterious letter in the library, a strange confession and a curious warning that speaks of Melmoth the Witness, a dark legend found in obscure fairy tales and antique village lore. As such superstition has it, Melmoth travels through the ages, dooming those she persuades to join her to a damnation of timeless, itinerant solitude. To Helen it all seems the stuff of unenlightened fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, unaware, as she wanders the cobblestone streets Helen is being watched. And then Karel disappears. . . . &lt;/p&gt;" />
