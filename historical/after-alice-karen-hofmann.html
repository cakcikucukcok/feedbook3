  <title>After Alice - Karen Hofmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;After retiring from the heady world of academia, Sidonie von T채ler has returned to the small Okanagan Valley town she escaped in her youth for the lights of the big city. The family orchard has since gone to seed, and even decades later Sidonie still finds herself living in the shadow of her deceased older sister Alice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As she gets down to work sifting through the detritus of her family&#39;s legacy, Sidonie is haunted by memories of trauma and triumph in equal measure, and must find a way to reconcile her past and present while reconnecting with the family members she has left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Hofmann&#39;s debut novel blends a poetic sensibility with issues of land stewardship, social stratification and colonialism, painting the geological and historical landscape of the Okanagan in vivid and varied colours.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
