  <title>Dangerous Journey - Joseph W. Myer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After years of self-destructive behavior and hard luck, former publicist James J.R. Cronyn finds love with the talented and graceful Kate Winfield. Her support and his newfound faith in God give him the strength to reunite with his estranged daughter, Elizabeth, and his son, Bobby, the owner and CEO of a successful computer company. As J.R. builds bonds with his children, things are finally looking up in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bobby tells J.R. that God has asked him to give a percentage of his money away, J.R. knows exactly what Bobby should do. He convinces Bobby to buy a large quantity of a particular drug that cures women and babies who are stricken with the HIV/AIDS virus. Bobby consents and agrees to join his father on a humanitarian mission to South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Father and son journey through the startling, yet beautiful landscape of South Africa with two fully equipped mobile clinics and two highly trained and experienced medical teams. Together, they deliver medical aid to hundreds, even thousands, of women and children. Often, when J.R. and Kaila, an extraordinary native woman, visit neighboring villages in search of women and babies in need of HIV/AIDS testing, they are confronted by angry young males who - because they refuse to accept the truth about the dreaded disease - curse and threaten them with physical harm. On his journey, J.R. meets Natasha, a beautiful and talented orphan, whom he wants to adopt, but they all face great danger when she is kidnapped and held ransom for $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J.R. never dreamed he and his son would venture down such a  hazardous path, but he will do whatever it takes to save Bobby and Natasha, even if it costs him his own life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
