  <title>One Night in Winter - Simon Sebag Montefiore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inspired by a true story, prize-winning historian and acclaimed novelist Simon Sebag Montefiore explores the consequences of forbidden love in this heartbreaking epic of marriage, childhood, danger, and betrayal that unfolds in Stalin&#39;s Moscow during the bleak days after World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Moscow celebrates the motherland&#39;s glorious victory over the Nazis, shots ring out on the crowded streets. On a nearby bridge, a teenage boy and girl&amp;#8212;dressed in traditional nineteenth-century costumes&amp;#8212;lie dead. But this is no ordinary tragedy, because these are no ordinary teenagers. As the son and daughter of high-ranking Soviet officials, they attend the most elite school in Moscow. Was it an accident, or murder? Is it a conspiracy against Stalin, or one of his own terrifying intrigues? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Stalin&#39;s instructions, a ruthless investigation begins into what becomes known as the Children&#39;s Case. Youth across the city are arrested and forced to testify against their friends and their parents. As families are ripped apart, all kinds of secrets come spilling out. Trapped at the center of this witch-hunt are two pairs of illicit lovers, who learn that matters of the heart exact a terrible price. By turns a darkly sophisticated political thriller, a rich historical saga, and a deeply human love story, Montefiore&#39;s masterful novel powerfully portrays the terror and drama of Stalin&#39;s Russia.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Jerusalem: A Biography (see review) was my first Montefiore nonfiction and One Night in Winter (2013) is his second novel, and my first Montefiore novel.<br /><b><i>One Night in Winter (Moscow Trilogy #3) by Simon Sebag ...</i></b> | He reanimates historical figures to unsettling effect, from Stalin himself to his dissolute son Vasily, and Beria. But ONE NIGHT IN WINTER is more than a recreation of history: by turns engrossing and upsetting, Montefiore makes his cast of children both hopelessly romantic and hopelessly moving.’ THE OBSERVER ‘Gripping and cleverly plotted.<br /><b><i>One Night in Winter - Simon Sebag Montefiore</i></b> | The plot is sometimes melodramatic, but it is gripping. The great strength of the novel is the the depiction of the danger of life under Stalin even for the Party Elite and their families. Simon Sebag Montefiore knows the period well, so his novel complements the many academic accounts which are available.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>One Night in Winter - Simon Sebag Montefiore</a> </h3></p><hr/>
