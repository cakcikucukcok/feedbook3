  <title>Chris and Louisa - Ralph P. Vander Heide, Judith H. Vander Heide</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The novel spans the years from early Mormonism in nineteenth-century Nauvoo, Illinois, to the 1960s, chronicling changes in moral values. Louisa, a fictional plural wife of Joseph Smith, matures through the hardships of the founding years and treks to Utah.&lt;br /&gt;
Chris, Louisas great-granddaughter, caught up in the turmoil of the 1960s, researches her ancestry in New York. She rejects Mormonism, enters a polygamous marriage, and contends with opposition and murder.&lt;br /&gt;
The novel explores the hostility against Mormons, and their conflicted mixture of piety and lust. In its chronological and geographical sweep, the plot moves from coast to coast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vander Heides have extensive firsthand experience with their subject matter. Ralph, a former Mormon, holds a PhD in Germanic and Hispanic studies and has taught in colleges and high schools. He studied writing under Brewster Ghiselin at the University of Utah. &lt;br /&gt;
Judy earned both BA and MA degrees. She studied writing with Wallace Stegner at Stanford University. Judy has worked as a history and English teacher in high schools and as a guidance counselor. The couple has lived in the regions covered in the novel, and they are now both retired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judy plays tennis. Ralph skis and runs. Together they travel and do volunteer work in the arts and humanities, but advise against spouses jointly writing a novel. They continue to consult each other but write separately.&lt;/p&gt;" />
