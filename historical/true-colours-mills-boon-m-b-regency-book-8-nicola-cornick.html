          &lt;strong&gt;The first person the Marquis of Mullineaux chanced to meet upon his return to England was the very last person he wanted to see–&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lady Carberry, the woman who had scandalized the haute ton by breaking off their engagement. She was just as displeased to meet him. He had, after all, sacrificed her reputation to save his pride. Thrown together by circumstance, Alicia and James found themselves constantly at war with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;James was determined to discover the truth about their past. Only then would he also discover that behind their anger lay a passion that had never died.&lt;/p&gt;
