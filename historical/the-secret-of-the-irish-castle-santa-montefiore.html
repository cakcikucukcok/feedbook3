But more surprises are in store for her after she discovers that her mother comes from the same place as JP, sealing her fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bridie Doyle, now Countess di Marcantonio and mistress of Castle Deverill, is determined to make the castle she used to work in her home.

But then Jack O&#39;Leary, the love of her life, returns to Ballinakelly. And this time his heart belongs elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long-held secrets come to light, the Deverills will have to heal old wounds and come to terms with the past if they hope to ensure their legacy for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
