  <title>Swift Currents - David Bruce Grim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-three year old Callie has lived in bondage at Oakheart Plantation since her birth. She has become a valuable asset to her cruel master, Daniel Bowen, but Callie, her two brothers, and her young daughter struggle to cope with the outrages of enslavement.  
Change occurs suddenly on November 7, 1861, 
when the Union Navy attacks Port Royal Sound in South Carolina.  Slavery ends across the surrounding sea islands after the planters flee.  Ten thousand newly freed people, like Callie and her family, begin life under the authority of the US government.
A historical novel based on actual events from 1861 to 1863, Swift Currents describes the slaves transition from bondage to freedom through the lens of Callie and her two brothers.  As they and others pursue education, work for wages, fight for freedom, and become landowners, their lives intersect with civilian and military authorities.  Callies story seeks to help the nation come to terms with its racial history and serves to provide a greater understanding of shared stories, thus lessening the inherited prejudice of generations." />
