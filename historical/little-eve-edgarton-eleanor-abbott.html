  <title>Little Eve Edgarton - Eleanor Abbott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;But you live like such a fool&amp;mdash;of course you&amp;#39;re bored!&amp;quot; drawled the Older Man, rummaging listlessly through his pockets for the ever-elusive match.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, I like your nerve!&amp;quot; protested the Younger Man with unmistakable asperity.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do you&amp;mdash;really?&amp;quot; mocked the Older Man, still smiling very faintly.&lt;br /&gt;
For a few minutes then both men resumed their cigars, staring blinkishly out all the while from their dark green piazza corner into the dazzling white tennis courts that gleamed like so many slippery pine planks in the afternoon glare and heat. The month was August, the day typically handsome, typically vivid, typically caloric.&lt;br /&gt;
It was the Younger Man who recovered his conversational interest first. &amp;quot;So you think I&amp;#39;m a fool?&amp;quot; he resumed at last quite abruptly.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, no&amp;mdash;no! Not for a minute!&amp;quot; denied the Older Man. &amp;quot;Why, my dear sir, I never even implied that you were a fool! All I said was that you&amp;mdash;lived like a fool!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Starting to be angry, the Younger Man laughed instead. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re certainly rather an amusing sort of chap,&amp;quot; he acknowledged reluctantly.&lt;br /&gt;
A gleam of real pride quickened most ingenuously in the Older Man&amp;#39;s pale blue eyes. &amp;quot;Why, that&amp;#39;s just the whole point of my argument,&amp;quot; he beamed. &amp;quot;Now&amp;mdash;you look interesting. But you aren&amp;#39;t! And I&amp;mdash;don&amp;#39;t look interesting. But it seems that I am!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
