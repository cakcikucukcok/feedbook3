&lt;p&gt;Validus witnessed Christs fabled and momentous Sermon on the Mount and became a secret Christian, embarking on an astounding journey that puts him in close proximity to other monumental historical figures, including Christs devoted apostle, Peter. He encounters the young and demented Emperor Gaius Caligula, his unlikely successor and uncle; the stuttering, physically crippled, and oft ridiculed but kindly Emperor Claudius; and Claudiuss lifelong friend, the illustrious King Herod Agrippa. &lt;/p&gt;
