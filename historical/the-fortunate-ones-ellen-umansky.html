  <title>The Fortunate Ones - Ellen Umansky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A BOOKLIST BEST DEBUT NOVEL OF THE YEAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One very special work of art&amp;#8212;a Chaim Soutine painting&amp;#8212;will connect the lives and fates of two different women, generations apart, in this enthralling and transporting debut novel that moves from World War II Vienna to contemporary Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is 1939 in Vienna, and as the specter of war darkens Europe, Rose Zimmer&amp;#8217;s parents are desperate. Unable to get out of Austria, they manage to secure passage for their young daughter on a kindertransport, and send her to live with strangers in England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six years later, the war finally over, a grief-stricken Rose attempts to build a life for herself. Alone in London, devastated, she cannot help but try to search out one piece of her childhood: the Chaim Soutine painting her mother had cherished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years later, the painting finds its way to America. In modern-day Los Angeles, Lizzie Goldstein has returned home for her father&amp;#8217;s funeral. Newly single and unsure of her path, she also carries a burden of guilt that cannot be displaced. Years ago, as a teenager, Lizzie threw a party at her father&amp;#8217;s house with unexpected but far-reaching consequences. The Soutine painting that she loved and had provided lasting comfort to her after her own mother had died was stolen, and has never been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This painting will bring Lizzie and Rose together and ignite an unexpected friendship, eventually revealing long-held secrets that hold painful truths. Spanning decades and unfolding in crystalline, atmospheric prose, &lt;em&gt;The Fortunate Ones&lt;/em&gt; is a haunting story of longing, devastation, and forgiveness, and a deep examination of the bonds and desires that map our private histories.&lt;/p&gt;" />
