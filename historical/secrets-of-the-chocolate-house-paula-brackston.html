Soon after, she has an upsetting vision of Samuel in great danger, compelling her to make another journey to the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time she&#39;ll meet her most dangerous adversary. This time her ability to travel to the past will be tested. This time she will discover her true destiny. Will that destiny allow her to return home? And will she be able to save Samuel when his own fate seems to be sealed?&lt;/p&gt;" />
