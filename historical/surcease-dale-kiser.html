  <title>Surcease - Dale Kiser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Surcease: The End and the Beginning is somewhat of a sequel to Top Secret: Eleven Years of Blood Sweat and Tears.  Most of the main character from Top Secret show up once again in Surcease as leading characters.  This is the story of a few people working to uncover and stop a very insidious operation designed to take down the leaders of many of the countries of the world.  The ultimate aim is to take over all these countries.  It is the story of the CIA versus The Russian Federations FSB, the successor to the infamous KGB.  It is a story of some deception, assassinations, double agents, and a bit of intrigue.  The writing contains some fact and some fiction. It is based loosely on the fact that the Soviets had a group named Group Nord which was composed of the chief of each of the KGB&#39;s Directorates. Group Nord was formed in the mid 1970&#39;s by the then director of the KGB, Yuri Andropov.  It&#39;s main function was to plan ways the old Soviet Union could take over the US and some other countries through peaceful means primarily. And it seems to have been designed to conduct political and psychological operations directed at undermining the will of the West and NATO.   Needless to say it did not succeed although the group functioned for years.   I took some liberties when writing about some of the factual things." />
