  <title>To Cast an Iron Shadow - Muneer Barkatullah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="December 18, 1973, was the most important day in Mohammed Ahmeds life, but it did not come without warning. Mohammed was the master planner for the growing city of Karachi, Pakistan. In the tumultuous time of his life, corruption ruled his country. As Pakistan came to terms with greed, Mohammeds attempts to build libraries and schools were often thwarted. What was a moral man to do?
Through Mohammeds childhood, he often fought for what was right. Beyond battles with greedy landlords and sudden family moves, he found his way to a prestigious school in the United States, where he not only earned an education but a drive to clean up his corrupt homeland. Along his journey, he also found time for love and children, striving to raise his offspring with similar upright values and ambitions.
Along his path, Mohammed Ahmed made many friendsbut he also made many enemies. As the most important day of his life approaches, he must answer to both. The decisions he has made will come back to haunt him; lesser evils will threaten to tear him down. Written by his grandson, &lt;i&gt;To Cast an Iron Shadow&lt;/i&gt; is the true life story of a man who did just that. He fought corruption and greed, but did it lead to glory or defeat?" />
