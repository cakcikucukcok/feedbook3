  <title>Joseph of Arimathea - Brian Mellor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="History seems to have placed Joseph of Arimathea too far back in the shadow of Jesus. It is my belief that it was he who influenced Jesuss life the most. This is a story of that man, whose relationship, mentoring, and guiding Jesus, led to his greatness. Joseph as Jesuss uncle very likely took over as head of the family upon the death of Jesuss father. Joseph had all the credentials and means, a wealthy merchant with great influence in Rome and in his own community. A member of the assembly of high judges, which made the laws and meted out punishment, appointed Minister of Mines to Rome, a man who must have associated with the likes of Caesar, Pontius Pilate, and Herod. He placed his career, his life and that of his family in jeopardy by his close association with Jesus. He and Jesus had much to lose for the ideas and beliefs they projected. I believe that their message was much more than spiritual belief in an all-powerful, all-knowing God. I believe the message had much to do with liberty and freedom, which was suppressed under both Rome and the religious establishment of the time, all this, is not unlike the issues we are witnessing in Asia today." />
