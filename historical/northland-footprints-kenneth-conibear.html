  <title>Northland Footprints - Kenneth Conibear</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a realistic novel of the Canadian Northwest, situated on Little
Bent Tree Lake in Canada&#39;s  Northwest Territories, in which animals are the
chief characters. It describes with humour, drama and pathos a whole
community of animals and birds and their unceasing struggle to live. It is
neither a fantasy nor a treatise. It is fiction, with creatures of the
world playing the main parts in the drama- the beaver, the muskrat, the
silver fox, the whiskey-jack, wolverine and many others. Along with all the
emotions that make any story worth reading- love, hate, fear, envy- here are
such animal/human qualities as heroism, devotion, mother love, fidelity,
cunning, all portrayed through the lives of the book&#39;s characters. Their
loves, hunger, feasts, fights, sadness, gladness, deaths, their
interrelations, the part played in their lives by winter, summer, the
snows, the winds, the buildings of the beaver, the introduction of fear
into their lives because of the introduction of man, the
hunter/trapper- these are combined into a unified plot which draws to an
exciting climax." />
