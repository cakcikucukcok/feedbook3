  <title>The Laird&#39;s Promise - Cassidy K. O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As Lady Margaret Ferguson&amp;rsquo;s twin brother, Gavin, lay on his deathbed, a plan of deception was set in motion. The Ferguson clan had always governed their land differently than most. Appointing Margaret as the new Laird upon her brother&amp;rsquo;s death wasn&amp;rsquo;t a stretch, and her people willingly accepted her. Disguised as her brother, her clan is committed to keeping Margaret&amp;rsquo;s identity hidden from outsiders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
None of them accounted for invites to the Kings court. After Margaret declines all invitations, Sir Keelan MacDougall is directed to ensure the clan&amp;rsquo;s loyalty to the King during wartime. Keelan meets both Laird Gavin and his sister, Margaret, and the resemblance is uncanny. Exhausted after days of switching back and forth between her two personas&amp;rsquo;, Margaret is torn between wanting Keelan to leave and begging him to stay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Margaret was promised she would be able to marry for love. When word gets out that she is acting as Laird of the Ferguson clan that privilege may be taken from her. But she won&amp;rsquo;t go down without a fight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
