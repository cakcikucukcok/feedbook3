  <title>Mothers and Daughters - Rae Meadows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A rich and luminous novel about three generations of women in one family: the love they share, the dreams they refuse to surrender, and the secrets they hold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Samantha is lost in the joys of new motherhood--the softness of her eight-month-old daughter&#39;s skin, the lovely weight of her child in her arms--but in trading her artistic dreams to care for her child, Sam worries she&#39;s lost something of herself. And she is still mourning another loss: her mother, Iris, died just one year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a box of Iris&#39;s belongings arrives on Sam&#39;s doorstep, she discovers links to pieces of her family history but is puzzled by much of the information the box contains. She learns that her grandmother Violet left New York City as an eleven-year-old girl, traveling by herself to the Midwest in search of a better life. But what was Violet&#39;s real reason for leaving? And how could she have made that trip alone at such a tender age?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In confronting secrets from her family&#39;s past, Sam comes to terms with deep secrets from her own. Moving back and forth in time between the stories of Sam, Violet, and Iris, &lt;i&gt;Mothers and Daughters&lt;/i&gt; is the spellbinding tale of three remarkable women connected across a century by the complex wonder of motherhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was later published under the title &lt;i&gt;Mercy Train. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
