  <title>Full Moon over Elkhorn - J. W. Harlan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the late 1800s, when the average prospector carries months of provisions, whiskey, a rifle, and, should he somehow become bored, a deck of cards. As Peter Wys travels across the United States in search of fortune, he falls victim to a fatal tragedy. But as soon as he departs the earth, Wys is replaced by new fortune seekers just as eager to find wealth within the Elkhorn silver mine.&lt;/p&gt;
Nathan Craig discovers Wys has left him money in gratitude for a past good deed, and he and his family head toward the mine with the hope of finding work and a new beginning. As Craig settles near the mine, he soon realizes that life is not easy for those who toil in the mine. When injury befalls the workers, theres only one man who can sew them up. But Doc Wellman is about to receive his biggest challenge when logger Mick OHare is struck down by a treeor so he thinks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Full Moon over Elkhorn&lt;/i&gt; is a richly crafted tale sprinkled with historical facts that details life on a mountain that remains forever eternal and forever changed by those who worked its silver mine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
