  <title>The Sisters Weiss - Naomi Ragen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; Powerful, page-turning and deeply moving, Naomi Ragen&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Sisters Weiss&lt;/i&gt; is an unforgettable examination of loyalty and betrayal; the differences that can tear a family apart and the invisible bonds that tie them together. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1950&#39;s Brooklyn, sisters Rose and Pearl Weiss grow up in a loving but strict ultra-Orthodox family, never dreaming of defying their parents or their community&#39;s unbending and intrusive demands. Then, a chance meeting with a young French immigrant turns Rose&#39;s world upside down, its once bearable strictures suddenly tightening like a noose around her neck. In rebellion, she begins to live a secret life - a life that shocks her parents when it is discovered. With nowhere else to turn, and an overwhelming desire to be reconciled with those she loves, Rose tries to bow to her parents&#39; demands that she agree to an arranged marriage. But pushed to the edge, she commits an act so unforgivable,  it will exile her forever from her innocent young sister, her family, and all she has ever known.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Forty years later, pious Pearl&#39;s sheltered young daughter Rivka suddenly discovers the ugly truth about her Aunt Rose, the outcast, who has moved on to become a renowned photographer. Inspired, but nave and reckless, Rivka sets off on a dangerous adventure that will stir up the ghosts of the past, and alter the future in unimaginable ways for all involved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
