  <title>Wagon Tracks - George Edward Moon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wagon Tracks: Across Kansas is a continuation of The Tennessee Mountain Man saga. Abel Strawn, one of Jack Leffingwells sharpshooters, has an opportunity to acquire land in the western Kansas Territory. On the surface, it seems like a good opportunity for him and his wife, Amanda. At the moment, they live with the senior Strawns in the Methodist Ministers parsonage. Abel functions as assistant minister. Settling in Kansas would give them land and a home of their own.
Trusting in the wisdom of Jack Leffingwell and encouraged by his friends approval, Abel and Amanda began the arduous journey in a prairie schooner. The year was 1869, in the midst of the Indian wars. It is a life-changing adventure for all concerned.
A host of interesting characters intertwine with the young pioneers, most of whom grow into a lifelong influence. Falling Water, a Cheyenne Indian chief; his sister, White Dove; and a troubled hero by the name of Zachary Wheat become a part of the story and keep the pages turning." />
