  <title>The Wicked City - Beatriz Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the first book of a breathtaking new trilogy by bestselling author Beatriz Williams, two generations of women are brought together inside a Greenwich Village apartment &amp;#8212;a flapper hiding an extraordinary past, and a modern-day Manattanite forced to start her life anew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she discovers her banker husband has been harboring a secret life, Ella Gilbert escapes her SoHo loft for a studio in Greenwich Village. Her charismatic musician neighbor, Hector, warns her to stay out of the basement after midnight, when a symphony of mysterious noise strikes up&amp;#8212;laughter, clinking glasses, jazz piano, the occasional bloodcurdling scream&amp;#8212;even though the space has been empty for decades. Back in the Roaring Twenties, the basement was home to one of the city&amp;#8217;s most notorious speakeasies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1924, Geneva &amp;#8220;Gin&amp;#8221; Kelly, a quick-witted flapper from the hills of western Maryland, is a regular at this Village hideaway. Caught up in a raid, Gin lands in the office of Prohibition enforcement agent Oliver Anson, who persuades her to help him catch her stepfather, Duke Kelly, one of the biggest bootleggers in Appalachia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gin is nobody&amp;#8217;s fool. She strikes a risky bargain with the taciturn, straight-arrow Revenue agent, and their alliance rattles Manhattan society to its foundations, exposing secrets that shock even this free-spirited redhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Ella unravels the strange history of her new building&amp;#8212;and the family thread that connects her to Geneva Kelly&amp;#8212;she senses the Jazz Age spirit of her exuberant predecessor invading her own shy nature, in ways that will transform her existence in the wicked city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
