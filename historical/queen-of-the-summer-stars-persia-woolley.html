  <title>Queen of the Summer Stars - Persia Woolley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Once again we are captivated by the magic of the legend that has long fed our appetite for pageantry and romantic adventure.&quot;&lt;br&gt; -Washington Post&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a country still reeling from the collapse of the Roman Empire, the young King Arthur and his wife Guinevere struggle to keep the barbarians at bay even as they establish the Fellowship of the Round Table. The spirited and outspoken Guinevere skillfully combats an accusation of planning to poison Arthur in a country simmering with unrest and scandal. But Guinevere&#39;s greatest battles are dangers Arthur cannot see-ones she&#39;ll have to fight on her own. And all the while, she must reconcile her thirst for freedom with her duties as queen, and her growing love for Lancelot with her loyalty to her husband.
