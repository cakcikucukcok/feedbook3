  <title>Without Mercy - Jefferson Bass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the most suspenseful installment of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; nestselling Body Farm series to date, forensic anthropologist Dr. Bill Brockton investigates a bizarre murder&amp;#8212;and confronts a deadly enemy he thought he&amp;#8217;d put behind bars for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forensic anthropologist Bill Brockton has spent twenty-five years solving brutal murders&amp;#8212;but none so bizarre and merciless as his latest case: A ravaged set of skeletal remains is found chained to a tree on a remote mountainside. As Brockton and his assistant Miranda dig deeper, they uncover warning signs of a deadly eruption of hatred and violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the shocking case is only the beginning of Brockton&amp;#8217;s trials. Mid-case, the unthinkable happens: The deadliest criminal Brockton has ever foiled&amp;#8212;the sadistic serial killer Nick Satterfield&amp;#8212;escapes from prison, bent on vengeance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But simply killing Brockton isn&amp;#8217;t enough. Satterfield wants to make him suffer first, by destroying everything he holds dear: Brockton&amp;#8217;s son, daughter-in-law, grandsons; even Miranda, his longtime graduate assistant, now on the verge of completing her Ph.D. and launching a forensic career of her own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dangers from all directions force Brockton to question two things on which he&amp;#8217;s based his entire career&amp;#8212;the justice system, and the quality of mercy&amp;#8212;and to wonder: can the two co-exist? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If not, which will Brockton choose in his ultimate moment of truth?&lt;/p&gt;" />
