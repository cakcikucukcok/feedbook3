      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Brett Tanager is the writer/producer of a hit TV detective show until the mistakes of one dreadful night send her life skidding out of control into a downward spiral that takes her job, family, savings and self-respect.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At her lowest ebb she is approached by Julia, her sixteen-year-old former stepdaughter whose best friend Caleigh has disappeared. Seems Julia&#39;s classmates, young daughters of Hollywood&#39;s elite, were &quot;partying&quot; with high rollers for a thousand bucks a night, and now Caleigh is missing, her parents are lying, and Julia is terrified. But not as terrified as Brett when Caleigh&#39;s naked corpse turns up and Julia goes missing.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brett&#39;s attempt to find Julia plunges her into a dark, disturbing journey through moneyed Hollywood and its sinister undersides. Now she must find resources other than drink to overcome her fears, as she is pitted against cunning of a ruthless killer, and a web of deceit in which the darkest secrets may be her own.&lt;/div&gt;" />
