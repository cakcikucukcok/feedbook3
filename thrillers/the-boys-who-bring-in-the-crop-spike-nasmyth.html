  <title>The Boys Who Bring in the Crop - Spike Nasmyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;THE BOYS WHO BRING IN THE CROP is a mostly true story about a group of amateur marijunana smugglers who operated out of Florida in the mid seventies. These guys really had some cajones, they did their thing right under the noses of the law. They made seven flights to Colombia and back and never got caught, partly because they were smart and planned well, partly because of dumb luck.
&lt;p&gt;
The book is fast paced, it all takes place in less than one year. Along the way there is plenty of adventure, not everything goes as planned. There is some romance thrown in, these guys knew how to enjoy life with the piles of money they accumulated." />
