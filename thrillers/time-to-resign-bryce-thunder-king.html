      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In TIME TO RESIGN, the third volume in a series of Jamie Paige thrillers, Jamie and Angie take a break from fighting crime to tackle an even bigger problemthe United States Congress.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;While watching a political rally on television, Jamie and Angie cant help but be intrigued by the young red-haired man prancing across the screen, urging the entire United States Congress to resign. When the man shows up at their doorstep a few days later asking for protection, they realize it is their duty as Americans to help him. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;His name is Ben Jefferson, and he has a plan to restore the United States to its former glory. He is organizing a protest in which millions of patriots will descend upon the U.S. Capitol to demand that Congress resign. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;But those in power will do everything they can to stop the march. Because of his incendiary message, Bens life is in constant peril. The fate of the nation may depend on whether Jamie and Angie can protect Ben from his powerful enemies. The events that unfold will forever alter the course of history. &lt;/p&gt;" />
