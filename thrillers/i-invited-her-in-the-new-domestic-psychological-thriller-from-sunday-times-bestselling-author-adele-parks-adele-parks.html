  <title>I Invited Her In: The new domestic psychological thriller from Sunday Times bestselling author Adele Parks - Adele Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;‘Packed with secrets, scandal and suspense, this is Adele Parks at her absolute best.’ &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;‘really REALLY good…absolutely brilliant’ Marian Keyes&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A gripping story of friendship and betrayal from international best-selling author Adele Parks&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;‘I invited her in… and she took everything.’ &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Mel hears from a long-lost friend in need of help, she doesn’t hesitate to invite her to stay. Mel and Abi were best friends back in the day, sharing the highs and lows of student life, until Mel’s unplanned pregnancy made her drop out of her studies.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, seventeen years later, Mel and Abi’s lives couldn’t be more different. Mel is happily married, having raised her son on her own before meeting her husband, Ben. Now they share gorgeous girls and have a chaotic but happy family home, with three children.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Abi, meanwhile, followed her lover to LA for a glamorous life of parties, celebrity and indulgence. Everything was perfect, until she discovered her partner had been cheating on her. Seventeen years wasted, and nothing to show for it. So what Abi needs now is a true friend to lean on, to share her grief over a glass of wine, and to have some time to heal. And what better place than Mel’s house, with her lovely kids, and supportive husband…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This dark, unsettling tale of the reunion of long-lost friends is thoroughly gripping exploration of wanting what you can’t have, jealousy and revenge from&lt;em&gt; Sunday Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller Adele Parks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
