  <title>Blood Virus - L. A. Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thousands are dying and many more sickened as an unknown virus runs rampant through Western Africa. Its victims experience a violent death within a few days of exposure, so the CDC jumps in before the virus can become a global pandemic. They send their best man, Dr. Lennox Richards of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, to ground zero in Benin.&lt;p&gt; 
Lennox heads up an international team of top specialists with the intent of identifying and possibly developing a vaccine to halt the viruss progress. However, theres a problematic variable: the virus is ethno-specific, killing only blacks and leaving others with nothing more than a common cold. As an African American, the stakes have suddenly changed for Dr. Lennox Richards. &lt;p&gt;
The good doctor has yet to realize a more sinister plot is being waged, with Benin as the initial test site for the bioengineered killer. A lethal plan is in effect to expose the worlds ethnic groups to a virus specific to their particular racein other words, the implementation of an ethnic bomb. &lt;p&gt;
With time running out and no cure in sight, will Dr. Lennox Richards be able to stay alive and halt the doomsday scenario that looms close at hand?" />
