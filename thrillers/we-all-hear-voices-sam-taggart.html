  <title>We All Hear Voices - Sam Taggart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Albert Lawrence Moon is a small-town guy with big-time dreams that never quite materialize. His only real asset is Moon&#39;s Bar and Grill in Gum Ridge, Arkansas. Even that business is struggling despite the busy racetrack across the street. But things at Moon&#39;s start to pick up after an odd fellow named Jack starts cooking for the joint.&lt;p&gt; 
Jack&#39;s inexplicable ability and his passion for flavors and smells turn even the most ordinary dishes into magnificent creations and soon turns Moon&#39;s into the hottest eatery in town. But Jack is plagued by voices only he can hear, and when he takes medicine to make the voices go away, he can no longer cook.&lt;p&gt; 
Owner and co-workers bond as their stories unfold against the backdrop of a little Southern greasy spoon. Mary Ann, the waitress who befriends Jack, is waiting for a tall-cotton cowboy to sweep her off her feet and far away from this town. Moon&#39;s newest get-rich-quick scheme threatens the cafe&#39;s business, and Jack sinks further into madness as the murmurs in his mind turn into loud, angry roars.&lt;p&gt; 
Brimming with Southern flavor and peppered with quirky characters with their own unique challenges, &lt;I&gt;We All Hear Voices&lt;/I&gt; serves up a tale of unlikely friendships and the human desire for happiness." />
