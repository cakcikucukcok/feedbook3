Pakistan&amp;#39;s chief investigator into US Operation Neptune Spear concluded Bin Laden was betrayed by Al Qaeda itself, fooling the CIA and gaining the US president&amp;rsquo;s bounty on their ailing leader&amp;rsquo;s head: $25,000,000, which may have given birth to deadly ISIS.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Loner, Agent Ben Markstein, betrayed and primed for retribution by his obsession with the Pakistani beauty at the dark heart of HARD ACT, an unsanctioned covert black operation planned by former US Senator Wendell Strachan to save the president and regain the $25,000,000 held in a Liechtenstein bank account by Saudi Prince Faisal bin Sharif, CEO of a billion-dollar Islamic charity trust and secret terrorist money-launderer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Markstein learns that Serena Lashari, the beautiful, clever, successful Geneva-based fund-manager is Prince Faisal&amp;rsquo;s lover and has the account codes. He acts ruthlessly, manipulating Wendell Strachan and the black operation to win Serena and the money for himself.?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Against a background of political conspiracy and escalating violence across Europe, culminating in potential catastrophe at a nuclear-armed U.S.A.F air-base in England, Ben Markstein plays HARD ACT&amp;rsquo;s ruthless game to win &amp;ndash; even at the cost of the lives of all who stand in his way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
