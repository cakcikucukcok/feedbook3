  <title>Myself - Leigh Santoro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Doctor Theodore Teddy Thyme is one of the best in his field. He finds his professional work both industrious and enjoyable. Raine Justice Liverboardman will prove to be the ultimate challenge of Dr. Thymes entire career.  Raine has been charged with attempted capital murder. Dr. Thyme is the psychiatrist chosen to examine Raine to determine if Raine is fit for trial.
The case itself is hazy at best. No body had been discovered; yet Raine confessed to the murder. When Dr. Thyme meets Raine, he finds a person infected by evil and genius in equal quantities. He questions Raines family members and finds a history of bizarre, ghastly, and probably abusive people. Which may explain the murderous behavior of his patient.
However, as the case goes to trial Dr. Thyme wonders if Raine is up to something more macabre. Some sort of sick joke, of sorts. Raine is certainly intelligent enough to undermine the United States judicial system. Yet there is a full confession from Raine on record.  Haunted by Raine, Dr. Thyme might soon discover that the proximity to madness has severe consequences.
These characters make the Jukes look like the Brady Bunch. Trying to understand the family tests even Thymes superlative skills.
Blueink Review
In Myself, Leigh Santoro tackles the viewpoints of multiple characters in the examination of a man who has been charged with attempted capital murder. The plot itself is interesting. Those who enjoy psychological intrigue may find this book fascinating. Readers who enjoy weighty psychological mysteries will be intrigued by Santoros premise.
Foreword Reviews
Santoros novel is a scrupulously detailed narrative. She unflinchingly delves into Raines psyche but handles the story with competence and finesse. The interviews Thymes conducted help the reader understand diagnoses like paranoid personality disorder, afflicting both Raine and Warren. The story in general is baffling, but the docs examination of an eccentric protagonist is enthralling.
