  <title>The  Birch  Tree - Tami L. Massaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graduation day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;June 7, 1961&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Three best friends, Molly Barr, Judy Woods, and Lee Kellerman, are happy to be leaving their indistinguishable high school years behind and are looking forward to what the future holds for them. Little do they know that before the night is over, their lives will be changed forever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Held up at a nearby construction site, the girls are late to the graduation celebration being held along the river. The party is already in full swing when they arrive and alcohol is freely being passed around. Not accustomed to drinking, Molly soon gets sick and heads back to the car, leaving her friends behind. There she is accosted by four popular jocks from the football team. Once Joe Flynn understands the intentions of the other three, he tries to help Molly. Outnumbered, Joe eventually does the unthinkable . . . he walks away. By the end of the night, one jock is dead and his body is buried at the construction site down the road.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the next forty-nine years, Molly and Lee have their own businesses to run and Judy is involved in charity work. As for the jocks, Bill Clark is sole owner of his family&amp;rsquo;s lucrative construction company and John Sheldon is a best-selling author. Most importantly, all five of them are rich.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After his experiences in Vietnam, Joe Flynn struggles to hold his life together.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As they are contemplating their retirement years, the body from that night is finally discovered. Once again, lives are turned upside down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
