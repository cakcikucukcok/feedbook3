  <title>The Light - Reginald J. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The City of Angels is under siege. Lil G Henderson, a charismatic and totally ruthless street gang leader from Inglewood has his sights set on becoming number one on the drug scene in Southern California. To make matters worse, he has been recruited and given almost limitless powers by the forces of evil whose soul purpose is to create as much havoc and devastation in the southland as possible.
Opposing Lil G and his posse of evil doers; Los Angeles has three new heroes. These three were strangers to each other until thrown together by the powers which have battled these evil forces since the beginning of time.
Thelma Johnson, a feisty middle-age community activist, James Pettigrew III a Harvard educated financial lawyer from a well-known, heavily connected black political family, and Paul Floatin Logan a white superstar basketball player, just drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers are now on the front line standing between Lil G and the innocent and unsuspecting Angelinos.
Along with Inglewood Homicide Detective L.Z. Anderson, who has been tasked with figuring out just whats happening with all the murder and mayhem that suddenly broke out in the city; are all now involved in a dangerous game of intrigue and subterfuge. As the battle rages, more and more individuals are drawn into the fray exposing deep dark family secrets which reach as far back as World War II; secrets which reveled could bring down the citys most powerful and well-respected citizens. 
This age old battle between Good and Evil means Life and Death for so many." />
