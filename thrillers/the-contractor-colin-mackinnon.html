  <title>The Contractor - Colin MacKinnon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rick Behringer is an outside contractor working for the Central Intelligence Agency. He owns a small company that, in the light of day, provides communications security for government offices, including the CIA. In the shadows, though, Rick&#39;s a spy. He runs overseas agents for the CIA and, through his firm, buys foreign military technology that the Agency wants to inspect but can&#39;t be seen purchasing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The divorced father of two little girls, Rick carries on a cold war with his ex, Liz, and a hot romance with his sexy girlfriend, Frannie. He still broods over the mysterious death of his father, a high-level CIA officer during the Vietnam War, who committed suicide when Rick was thirteen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through contacts in what he calls the &quot;Black World,&quot; Rick hears of a mysterious Pakistani Islamist, a rogue nuclear physicist, who is trying to acquire highly-enriched uranium in order to construct &quot;an Islamic bomb&quot; - a scheme that is all too credible. In tracking him down, Rick encounters a host of characters, some willing to help, many more willing to take his life. And in the explosive conclusion, he struggles in a deadly game of wits with Russian gangsters and the terrorist who is plotting nuclear mass murder in America.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Contractor&lt;/i&gt;, Colin MacKinnon shows once again his rare ability to turn real-world facts into riveting spy fiction. &lt;i&gt;The Contractor&lt;/i&gt; could happen...could be happening now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
