  <title>The Business Of Strangers (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Kylie Brant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A WOMAN WITHOUT A PAST&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She didn&#39;t know her name, didn&#39;t know her nationality. The newly manufactured &quot;Rianna Kingsley&quot; only knew that her martial-arts skills and weaponry and assassination techniques went far beyond the average person&#39;s….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A MARK THAT BECAME A DEATH WARRANT&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The men who&#39;d tried to assassinate her all shared one common trait: a tattoo of a winged horse, exactly like the one on her ankle. Where had it come from–and what did it mean to her survival?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A MAN WHO WAS MORE THAN A STRANGER&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was dangerous for Rianna to share too much with anyone–much less the criminal hired to kill her–but she couldn&#39;t resist Jake Tarrance&#39;s arms, his bed. With her shadowy past hot on her heels, would Rianna&#39;s business with Jake be passionate…or deadly?&lt;/p&gt;
