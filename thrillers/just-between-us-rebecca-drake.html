Four friends living the suburban ideal. Their jobs are steady, their kids are healthy. They&#39;re as beautiful as their houses.  But each of them has a dirty little secret, and hidden behind the veneer of their perfect lives is a crime and a mystery that will consume them all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything starts to unravel when Alison spots a nasty bruise on Heather&#39;s wrist. She shares her suspicions with Julie and Sarah, compelling all three to investigate what looks like an increasingly violent marriage. As mysterious injuries and erratic behavior mount, Heather can no longer deny the abuse, but she refuses to leave her husband. Desperate to save her, Alison and the others dread the phone call telling them that she&#39;s been killed. But when that call finally comes, it&#39;s not Heather who&#39;s dead. In a moment they&#39;ll come to regret, the women must decide what lengths they&#39;ll go to in order to help a friend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Just Between Us&lt;/i&gt; is a thrilling glimpse into the underbelly of suburbia, where not all neighbors can be trusted, and even the closest friends keep dangerous secrets. You never really know what goes on in another person&#39;s mind, or in their marriage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
