        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Chosen to be the ultimate secret operative, Helen Roston has become the most dangerous woman in the world.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two years of training and she&#39;s now ready for the final phase–a risky combination of virtual reality and a mind-altering serum. When her mysterious and faceless &quot;trainer&quot; syncs his mind to hers using the program, she&#39;s amazed at her sizzling response to his virtual touch. But Helen likes to be in control. She&#39;s not going to beg for more.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Helen&#39;s final test is a challenging mission, picked by the other government agencies whose candidates lost out to her. To succeed, she has to put herself completely in the hands of her trainer, a man she&#39;s not sure she can trust. But all of COS Command are counting on her. She cannot fail.&lt;/p&gt;
