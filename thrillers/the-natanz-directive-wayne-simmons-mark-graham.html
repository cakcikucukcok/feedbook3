      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A former operative in the CIA&#39;s most clandestine division is pulled back in to help prevent Armageddon in the Middle East&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unexpected phone call from the Pentagon propels &quot;superpatriot&quot; Jake Conlan back into the deadly world of international espionage and &quot;black ops&quot; he thought he had left behind him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake is asked to mount an emergency, highly dangerous mission inside Iran. His mission: to develop intel that can indisputably prove that Iran has nuclear-launch capabilities and bring down the current Iranian regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traveling from Paris to Amsterdam and then undercover into Iran itself, Jake connects with the Iranian covert opposition only to discover there is a traitor on his team. With a ticking clock counting down, Jake has to risk his mission, and his life, to uncover the traitor, and stop an imminent attack on Israel, for it will be full-scale world war if he fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fans of Alistair Maclean, Adam Hall, and Brad Thor will find themselves held hostage by &lt;i&gt;The Natanz Directive&lt;/i&gt;, an action-packed thriller from former CIA agent Wayne Simmons and coauthor Mark Graham.&lt;/p&gt;" />
