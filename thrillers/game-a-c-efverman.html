  <title>GAME - A. C. Efverman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three women are found naked and brutally murdered in central parts of Sydney - and DS Morgan Callaghan is assigned to lead the investigations of what seems to be the work of a serial killer.
One of the murder victims is a young Danish citizen - and as Sydney is hosting the World Cup in a few weeks&#39; time, Morgan has added pressure from his superiors and FIFA to find the killer before more people from all over the world descend on Sydney to watch the World Cup games.
At the same time, Morgan&#39;s mother is dying, and Morgan is torn as his family doesn&#39;t understand how much time he has to spend at work.
GAME is a dark thriller that takes you on a journey through Sydney: where you will get to know Detective Sergeant Morgan Callaghan and the people in his life. You will also follow the murder investigations closely - all the way to the twisted end." />
