  <title>Firstborn (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Lindsay McKenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Jason Trayhern wore his father&#39;s glorious military legacy like a thorny crown. Though a skilled fighter pilot himself, Jason&#39;s rebel tactics didn&#39;t sit well with his commanding officers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;They expected more from Morgan Trayhern&#39;s son, which was why they gave Jason another chance. But that chance felt like a death sentence. For Jason was going into combat with a new partner. And she was all too…&lt;em&gt;female.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A handsome, arrogant daredevil was the last thing Annie Dazen needed in her cockpit. But once she saw the wounded heart beneath Jason&#39;s tough-guy facade, she longed to heal him. And once she discovered the passion in this brooding soldier&#39;s touch, she longed to hold him tight. Now the stakes were higher. Because if she hoped to see a future with her would-be hero, they needed to survive their dangerous mission first!&lt;/p&gt;
