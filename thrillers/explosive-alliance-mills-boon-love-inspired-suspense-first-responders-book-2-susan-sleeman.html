        &lt;p&gt;RACE AGAINST TIME&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The last thing Krista Curry expected to find in a soccer stadium was a time bomb. When she alerts explosives expert Cash Dixon, she becomes a local hero. But the attention could expose her real name–and the infamous past she fought to escape. Cash promises Krista protection from the bomber&#39;s retaliation. Yet she hesitates to trust him as she sees his suspicion about her grow with every question she dodges. She can&#39;t expect Cash to continue to safeguard her unless she tells him the truth. Now Cash must decide if she&#39;s an innocent woman or guilty accomplice. But the clock is ticking down–and the real bomber is still on the loose…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First Responders: Brave men and women alert and ready for danger and love.&lt;/p&gt;
