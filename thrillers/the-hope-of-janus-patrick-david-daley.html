  <title>The Hope of Janus - Patrick David Daley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pope Paul VII has just reluctantly abdicated. Dante Sabatini, head of the feared Praetorian Order, is preparing to seize control of the Vatican and install Cardinal Charles Ambrosia on the papal throne. In a move to cripple those who oppose him, Sabatini commissions his private assassin, Angelica, to eliminate, through a deadly solution, the problems posed by the island nation of Janus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As turmoil overtakes the peaceful islanders, they must reconcile their commitment to understanding and tolerance against the harsh realities threatening to destroy their centuries-old way of life. While fear and tension stalk Janus, the resulting chaos and violence finally force Sean Brennan to decide the future he wants. As events spiral far beyond his control, Sean is left with two choices: to work with the Spirit to take the islands message to the world and achieve global reconciliation or return to his former life in London, forever ending any possibility of a future on Janus with his fiance, Diane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing tale, peaceful islanders attempt to overcome a brutal tragedy and further retribution instigated by a corrupt Vatican while Sean faces an agonizing decision whether to let hope in the future be his guide or accept that not all dreams are destined to become reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
