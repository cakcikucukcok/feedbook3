  <title>The Lemur - Benjamin Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new thriller from the Booker Prize-winning and Edgar-nominated author of &lt;i&gt;Christine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; Falls&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Silver Swan&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;John Glass&#39;s life in New York should be plenty comfortable. He&#39;s given up his career as a journalist to write an authorized biography of his father-in-law, communications magnate and former CIA agent Big Bill Mulholland. He works in a big office in Mulholland Tower, rent-free, and goes home (most nights) to his wealthy and well-preserved wife, Wild Bill&#39;s daughter. He misses his old life sometimes, but all in all things have turned out well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when his shifty young researcher--a man he calls &quot;The Lemur&quot;--turns up some unflattering information about the family, Glass&#39;s whole easy existence is threatened. Then the young man is murdered, and it&#39;s up to Glass to find out what The Lemur knew, and who killed him, before any secrets come out--and before any other bodies appear.Shifting from 1950s Dublin to contemporary New York, the masterful crime writer Benjamin Black returns in this standalone thriller--a story of family secrets so deep, and so dangerous, that anyone might kill to keep them hidden.&lt;/p&gt;" />
