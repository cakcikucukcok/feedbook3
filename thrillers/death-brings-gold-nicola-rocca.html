  <title>Death Brings Gold - Nicola Rocca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if morning brought something other than gold?&lt;br /&gt;
Milan. The body of a man is found in his apartment. He is lying on the floor in an unusual position, with both his hands on his heart.&lt;br /&gt;
No blood, no cuts. No gunshot wounds. Only a golden necktie perfectly knotted around the victim&amp;rsquo;s neck. Inspector David Walker of the Police Homicide squad is called to the murder scene.&lt;br /&gt;
The first clues indicate a crime of passion, but a couple of days later a similar incident occurs. Another man is found dead. Same position; same necktie around his throat.&lt;br /&gt;
In his mouth, a gold tag with some symbols engraved on it. Walker has no doubts: they are dealing with a serial killer. The one who the press will later refer to as &amp;lsquo;The Necktie Killer&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
This is where the seemingly impossible task of catching a killer begins.&lt;br /&gt;
The investigations fail to produce any results and the killing continues...&lt;br /&gt;
