  <title>The Ides of March - Ron Cutler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As punishment for disobeying his superiors and bringing a Serbian killer to justice, McCord, an experienced intelligence officer with the NSA, is sent to investigate a mysterious disturbance on the Ugandan border. What he discovers is a camp manned by Russian scientists who once worked for Bio-preparat, the top secret Soviet bio-weapons facility. Using the cover of the civil war, the scientists have been monitoring the experimental use of a strange new weapon being used to destroy the native population. But before McCord can get there, the camp is attacked by terrorists who manage to hijack the weapon.  
&lt;p&gt;A sole terrorists survives the attack, which reveals the weapon&#39;s devastating effect for which there is no known cure. Ironically, it is the surviving terrorist who carries the genetic code for a possible treatment. A man McCord must find before he accomplishes the horror of his deadly mission.  
&lt;p&gt;In a race against time, McCord is aided by Dr. Kate Atwood, a researcher at the Army&#39;s top secret bio-weapon facility at Fort Detrick. McCord and Kate are propelled on an intensive journey that takes them from Africa to Moscow, South America, London, Washington and finally, New York, where they discover the true nature of the weapon itself and the ultimate aim of the terrorist&#39;s mission. A holocaust that will destroy millions." />
