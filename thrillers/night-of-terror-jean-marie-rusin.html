  <title>&quot;Night of Terror&quot; - Jean Marie Rusin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;At point, you have tolet go and trust your kids to take care of themselves-what&#39;s theworst that can happen.right? So, when Tom and his wife leave their daughters to fend for themselves while they go out for nice dinner alone, their worst fear is that girls will burn their pizza rolls, or eat too much junk food. It&#39;s not what the girls are eating that should have them worried - but what might eat them....&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Liz and Janetand Kelly think their biggest problemwill be getting along with each other and keeping themselves amused,but when their dog &quot;Lucky&quot; begins barking furiously at thewindow, they get their first clue that this night may harbor something sinster, Little do they know the nightof terror which lies ahead of them.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Now with the Police on amanhunt for killer cannibals and a freak chemical spill in the area, the forces of horror are about to descend upon the town. Unimaginable nightmares are gathering on the streets . Eerie sounds- and far-off screams give the girls scant warning that they are in for the night - and the fight- of their lives.&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Fan ofhorror will turn a new page of action, adventure andterror as author Jean Rusin treats them to her grisly take on &quot;home alone&quot;in her newest tale &quot;Night of Teror&quot;! Lock your doors, turn on the nightlight and pray that you live to see the morning sun...&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
