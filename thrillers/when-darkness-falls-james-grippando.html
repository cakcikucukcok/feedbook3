  <title>When Darkness Falls - James Grippando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the latest novel from the bestselling author whom critics have called &quot;the thriller writer to watch,&quot; lawyer Jack Swyteck tackles a case in which the life of his best friend hangs in the balance&amp;#8212;and in which nothing is as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miami criminal defense attorney Jack Swyteck isn&#39;t looking for a new client, at least not one who is homeless and in jail for threatening to jump off a bridge. But from the moment Jack is called to defend the man, who goes by the name Falcon, something is amiss. For one thing, Falcon comes up with the $10,000 bail&amp;#8212;in cash. Then the body of a brutally murdered woman is found in the trunk of the abandoned car in which he is living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panicked and on the run, Falcon takes Jack&#39;s best friend, Theo, hostage. They end up barricaded in a motel room, and Theo isn&#39;t the only one at Falcon&#39;s mercy. Jack must work with the cops and their crackerjack negotiator to free Theo and the other captives before Falcon decides he has nothing to lose by killing them all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Jack doesn&#39;t know is that Falcon has a much bigger agenda, and that there are people behind the scenes who will stop at nothing to keep their dangerous secrets. Thus unfolds a riveting, lightning-paced story, as only James Grippando can tell it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
