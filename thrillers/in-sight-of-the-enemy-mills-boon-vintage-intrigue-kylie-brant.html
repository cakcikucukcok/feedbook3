        &lt;p&gt;Subject: Mother-to-be Cassie Donovan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Family History: Her true heritage won&#39;t be found on her Texas ranch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deepest Secret: She can see into the future.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the future she sees is her own–filled with murder! For Cassie, her power was frightening. To Dr. Shane Farhold, it was a curse, and his skepticism had dampened their torrid affair, leaving Cassie with a broken heart and a baby on the way. But someone saw her ability as a gift worth killing for. When battle-scarred Shane rescued her from a kidnap attempt, Cassie was thrust into his arms once again as they ran for their lives. Determined to protect Cassie and their child at all costs, Shane stayed close–and they soon shared rekindled passion and new understanding. But with danger at their heels, not even Cassie could predict a happy ending….&lt;/p&gt;
