It&#39;s claimed he found a backdoor to the Afterlife, that he looked into the Mind of God and escaped with a secret so powerful it could change all humanity...bring wars to a standstill...end forever the age-old hatreds between races, creeds and cultures.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six days later as Merton prepared to announce his discovery at a religious conference, he suffered a horrific death under mysterious circumstances.

Angela, an agnostic, wants to help Ian heal the wounds of a traumatic childhood plane crash that took the lives of his parents.  Ian, a defrocked priest, no longer trusts in religion&#39;s promise of eternal life.
