  <title>Three Days in August - Mike Holst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This story is a tale of a cynical and brutal outsider, who holds a small town in Iowa hostage for three days. Billy Joe, an incorrigible red neck crook, was fresh from being booted out of the army when he befriended a run away teen, and a nave, Iowa boy named Teddy, whose father happened to own the local bank, back in Teddys hometown. After a short crime spree across the desert southwest Billy hatches a plan to rob the bank and Teddy is caught in the middle. The robbery is botched and ends up in a standoff situation.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Enter Clem, the proud local sheriff, unwilling to call in outside help, confident he can weather the storm and bring Billy to justice and free the hostages. Clem is under terrible pressure to bring the incident to a conclusion, yet unwilling to risk the lives of innocent people by swarming the bank or doing something foolish.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is a story full of small town characters, blended together into a tale that will have you running the gambit from laughter to anger. From fear and apprehension to enjoying the down-to-earth love and camaraderie, amongst people, that you find only in small town America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
