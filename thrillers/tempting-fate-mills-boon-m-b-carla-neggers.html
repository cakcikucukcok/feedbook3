  <title>Tempting Fate (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Carla Neggers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;In a town of flamboyance, wealth and family feuds, a mystery of the past is about to resurface.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite her success as a young entrepreneur, Dani Pembroke is a haunted woman. Long ago her mother vanished without a trace, leaving Dani to live with her wealthy relatives, who have their own questionable pasts. Although the residents of Saratoga, New York, gossip that Lilli Pembroke&#39;s disappearance will never be solved, Dani is confident that she will find the truth one day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That day draws near when security expert Zeke Cutler arrives in Saratoga. The two join forces in an effort to find out what really happened to Lilli Pembroke. But Dani is unaware that her fearless partner has his own reasons for uncovering the truth…and that their search is putting them on track to collide with a killer who will do anything to keep that secret buried.&lt;/p&gt;
