  <title>Killing Season Part 3 - Faye Kellerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the final installment of &lt;/em&gt;New York Times&lt;em&gt; bestselling author Faye Kellerman&amp;#8217;s three-part series, the serial killer whom Ben has been searching for targets once again someone he loves&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Ro&amp;#8217;s stint working part time at a hotel where scientists frequently stay, she manages to hack into their computer and retrieve a list of scientists&amp;#8217; and other lab employees&amp;#8217; names. When she gives the data to Ben, he&amp;#8217;s floored that she&amp;#8217;s gone to such lengths for him. Though the ice between them has melted, he knows he can&amp;#8217;t get involved with Ro or anyone else again until he finds Ellen&amp;#8217;s killer. He can&amp;#8217;t afford the distractions. But he doesn&amp;#8217;t realize just how close he&amp;#8217;s come to the killer&amp;#8212;or that the killer knows Ben is on to him&amp;#8212;until he finds all of the tires on his car slashed after leaving the prom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Ben knows no one he loves is safe&amp;#8212;not Ro, not his parents, not his teenage sister Hayley, or her best friend Lily who has a huge crush on him. With the stakes dangerously high, Ben knows he&amp;#8217;s running out of time&amp;#8212;and that his next chance at apprehending the killer may very well be his last&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;" />
