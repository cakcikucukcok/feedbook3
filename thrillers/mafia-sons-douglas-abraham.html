  <title>Mafia Sons - Douglas Abraham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mafia Sons traces the evolution of a son who becomes a don. A devoted, kind, and gentle husband transforms into a ruthless murderer when he takes the mantle and becomes the don, the ruler of the family. Ellen and Antonio fly to Venice and Rome on a buying trip, spending millions for jewelry and haute couture fashions. Antonio is caring, loving, and giving. They fly on to Sicily where he deposits by bank transfers hundreds of millions of dollars in numbered accounts. He also arranges for protection for his father, the Don, who is escaping New York before his pending indictments. Ellen, a beautiful, loving, and caring wife, learns of her husbands involvement with the Mafia. During their six-year idyllic, wonderful marriage, she has been told Antonio was an investment banker. When she learns of his ascension as the don and of the cruel, murderous acts committed after he became the head of the family, she struggles to find a way to escape with her young son, Joey. She realizes he will be faced with the same personality and morals changes if he is allowed to remain a son in that household. Ellen secretly vows Joey will not become a don and tries to find a way to escape with him. Dan, a handsome FBI Agent, meets her to tell of Antonios murderous deeds. He reveals Antonio is in collusion with Al Qaeda to bomb the Security Exchange building in New York. When Antonio becomes aware Ellen knows all about him and his involvement, he sets out to stop her from taking Joey and to keep her from revealing his traitorous plans. Ellen had always been told Antonios mother died when he was very young. She meets her in Central Park. She is the lady who always comes to visit with Joey and his nursemaid. Ellen realizes it is Joeys grandmother. Ellen hears of Antonios mothers experiences with Antonios father when he became the don. She had escaped, taking another identity, hoping to take her young Antonio with her, but she was prevented from doing so. When Antonio learned Ellen knows of his murderous acts and traitorous plans, he sets out to do away with her. There are numerous spellbinding chase and escape scenes with Antonios men, who are in pursuit of Ellen. She alone and with the help of Dan manages to escape Antonio and his force of men on eight suspenseful occasions, each time barely escaping. Ellen is caught by Antonio when she tries to slip into their condo to take Joey. He forces her to go to the wharf where he is to meet with two members of Al Qaeda. Antonio is to deliver a truck with tons of explosives. In exchange, he is to receive a huge monetary payment. Using James Bondlike devices furnished to her by Dan and the FBI, Ellen manages to kill Antonio just as he is about to kill her. This is a novel of twenty chapters, each written to become part of a series for TV or a movie after its initial publication. Ellena beautiful, young, caring mother and wife who discovers, after six years of marriage, her husband is a member of the Mafia and is soon to be the don. Antonio Jr.Ellens husband. At first a loving, gentle husband, he becomes a monster when he assumes the murderous authority and becomes the don.
