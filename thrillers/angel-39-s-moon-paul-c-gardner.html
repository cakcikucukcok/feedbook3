  <title>Angel&#39;s Moon - Paul C. Gardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Al Garcia takes his special operations team into southeastern Arizona, he uncovers massive corruption leading right back to Washington DC. Garcias probe of cross-border drug smuggling and brutal drug related murders of innocent American citizens exposes a network of criminals and terrorists entwined with corrupt border protection agents and members of Congress.
Cartel enforcers viciously beat a man to death in full view of dozens. The only witnesses brave or foolish enough to come forward are themselves eliminated. A retired couple, doing research for a book, are savagely murdered for what they saw in the desert. Those crimes terrify a family with first-hand information of a drug smuggling operation possibly protected by Americas own border patrol officials. Fearful, not knowing if local law enforcement can be trusted, they turn to a Washington connection. Arrests are followed by savage retaliation and intimidation by the drug alliance. Eventually the president orders the elimination of the cartels leaders in their protected Mexican compounds. But it is not over; the terrorists are still here  ." />
