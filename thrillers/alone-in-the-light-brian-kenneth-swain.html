  <title>Alone in the Light - Brian Kenneth Swain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;In Chechnya, a terrible mistake costs a
brilliant young engineer his family.&lt;p&gt;
In Istanbul, an oil tanker on its maiden voyage sinks for no apparent reason.&lt;p&gt;
In Moscow, an astonishing new weapon threatens to upset the balance of world power.&lt;p&gt;
And in Sochi, a cutting-edge energy facility opens for business.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Movlady Saidov is a young man struggling to navigate a tightrope between rage and love, embroiled in a complex web of conspiracy only partly
of his own making. His story is fiction, but the technology, the politics, and the tension are as real as the headlines of yesterdays newspaper. This is Swains most compelling thriller yet, drawing
together the seemingly unrelated worlds of cryogenic fuel technology and directed energy weaponry and placing them at the center of a high-stakes game of global geopolitics.&lt;p&gt;
It will keep you guessing. It will keep
you thinking. It will keep you engrossed
until the final climactic moments." />
