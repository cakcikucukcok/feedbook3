  <title>Sandstorm - James Rollins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nationally bestselling author James Rollins has transported readers to the dark heart of the Amazon, the bowels of the earth, far below the ocean, and the top of the world. Now he embarks upon his most gripping and terrifying adventure yet: to a nightmare buried beneath a treacherous desert wasteland.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;An inexplicable explosion rocks the antiquities collection of a London museum&amp;#8212;a devastating blast that sets off alarms in clandestine organizations around the world, as the race begins to determine how it happened, why it happened, and what it means.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lady Kara Kensington&#39;s family paid a high price in money and blood to found the gallery that now lies in ruins. And her search for answers is about to lead Kara and her friend Safia al-Maaz, the gallery&#39;s brilliant and beautiful curator, into a world they never dreamed actually existed. For new evidence exposed by the tragedy suggests that Ubar, a lost city buried beneath the Arabian desert, is more than mere legend . . . and that something astonishing is waiting there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two extraordinary women and their guide, the international adventurer Omaha Dunn, are not the only ones being drawn to the desert. Former U.S. Navy SEAL Painter Crowe, a covert government operative and head of an elite counterespionage team, is hunting down a dangerous turncoat, Crowe&#39;s onetime partner, to retrieve the vital information she has stolen. And the trail is pointing him toward Ubar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the many perils inherent in a death-defying trek deep into the savage heart of the Arabian Peninsula pale before the nightmarish secrets to be unearthed at journey&#39;s end. What is hidden below the sand is more than a valuable relic of ancient history. It is an ageless power that lives and breathes&amp;#8212;an awesome force that could create a utopia or tear down everything humankind has built during millennia of civilization. Many lives have already been destroyed by ruthless agencies dedicated to guarding its mysteries and harnessing its might. And now the end may be at hand for Safia, for Kara, for Crowe, and for all the interlopers who wish to expose its mysteries, as it prepares to unleash the most terrible storm of all . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
