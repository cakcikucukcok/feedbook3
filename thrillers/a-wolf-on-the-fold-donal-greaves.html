      <meta name="description" content="Captain Scholland an instructor in the Royal Marines and a member of the U.N. Force spends his leave with his wife Candida in the area of Israel near the Lebanese border. A skirmish between a gang of terrorists and the Israeli border force results in the death of Candida and the Captain is wounded. After recovering from his wounds he resigns his commission and eventually offers himself for hire as a hard man among the criminal fraternity, abandoning his school girl daughter to the care of her aunt. He had assumed the name of Candor as a tribute to his wife. Eventually he is hired to destroy the Knesset in Jerusalem and having a hatred of the Israelis who he blamed for the death of his wife he travels to Israel and with help from the Palestinians attempts to carry out his task. He is thwarted by two Mossad agents and a British police officer and his own daughter who, not recognizing him prevents Scholland from killing her husband, one of the Mossad agents, by shooting him, not being aware that he is her father as it is years since he left her with her aunt. The assassin is later murdered whilst in hospital recovering from his wounds, by another hit man also hired by the people who had recruited him as revenge for his having killed one of their own men." />
