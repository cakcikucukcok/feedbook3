  <title>Hahrper &amp; the Thing - Jeff Hylton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Steven Isaac Hahrper has devoted his life to the absurdly romantic pursuit of women he barely knows. What Hahrper doesn&#39;t know, is that he is haunted by a terrible monster...an ancient Thing which feeds on Hahrper&#39;s senseless, fathomless lust.  
When Hahrper tires of hollow affairsand meets a woman with whom he could share true lovethe Thing refuses to let Hahrper go. True love contains no nourishment for the Thing. And It will not lose Its fantastic meal-ticket Hahrper.
And, oh, what high jinks ensue...Terrifying visions. Devastatingly erotic visions. A full-length pornographic, yet moralistic Dr.Seuss-style story. Trips to fully-realized personal hells for Hahrper and all his friends. More naked women than even Hahrper could shake a stick at. And, of course, a climactic battle fought atop a fifteen hundred foot replica of Hahrper&#39;s own medium-sized pink penis.
All this pulse-pounding, boob-filled action is accompanied by such timeless Steve Hahrper-penned songs as:  &quot;Scrumdillyicious Poontang&quot;, &quot;Magnet Face&quot;, &quot;Why There Must Be Titty-bars In Heaven:&quot;, &quot;On The Slopes Of Sarah&quot;, and &quot;All Roads Lead To My Dick&quot;...to name a few.
A modern fable about the triumph of true love...and the boundless idiocy of the human male." />
