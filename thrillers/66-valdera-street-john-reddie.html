  <title>66 Valdera Street - John Reddie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Doug Croft lost his parents to a drunk driver as a child, his uncle Harold took him in. Years later, Doug has grown to adulthood when Harold passes away and leaves everything to his nephew, including a sizeable property and home at 66 Valdera Street. Doug now has a house and a good job at the local shipyard. He just needs someone to share his life with.
By chance, he meets twenty-two-year-old Lurene Stafford, a beautiful, single waitress at the diner where Doug goes for lunch every day. Hes immediately drawn to her, soon finding himself in love. Although Lurene doesnt really love Doug in return, she accepts his marriage proposal, looking for financial security. 
Before too long, things begin take a nose - dive for Doug. He loses his shipyard job due to a lay-off and his tenants move out along with other setbacks. Lurene meets Steve Hobbs at her work and rents their vacant apartment to him. Lurene falls hard for Steve not knowing that he is a criminal with dangerous associates and is planning a major theft. Dougs enviable life begins to crumble with truly unexpected results." />
