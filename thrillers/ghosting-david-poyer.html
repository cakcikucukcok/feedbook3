  <title>Ghosting - David Poyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jack Scales, a prominent neurosurgeon, is at the peak of his career. To celebrate, he decides to make up for lost time and buys a sailing yacht christened Slow Dance, for a family cruise to Bermuda. But the family is strained: Jack&#39;s wife Arlen is secretly considering leaving the marriage; Rick, their bipolar twenty-year-old son, may need to be committed to a group home; Haley, a rebellious teenager, would rather be anywhere but trapped on a boat with her family; and Jack himself is not prepared for the challenge of the open sea. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Day by day, the Scales face mounting dangers. A lightning storm nearly destroys the boat, Rick&#39;s unstable condition worsens, and both Arlen and Haley realize that Jack is in over his head. Still, emerging from the storm, they find a fragile unity...until a man adrift on a raft leads them into danger against a terrifying gang of smugglers, who will stop at nothing to gain control of Slow Dance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with an expert seaman&#39;s knowledge and driven by conflicted characters, &lt;i&gt;Ghosting &lt;/i&gt;is a new direction for an established author: a thrilling adventure as unpredictable as the sea itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
