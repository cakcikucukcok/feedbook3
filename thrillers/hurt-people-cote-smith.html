  <title>Hurt People - Cote Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Summer of 1988. Leavenworth, Kansas: a town with four major prisons, gripped by the recent escape of a convict. Yet for two young brothers, all that matters is the pool in their apartment complex. They spend their blissful days practicing dives while their divorcée mother works her day shift at the golf course and their policeman father patrols the streets.  But when a mysterious stranger appears poolside and creates a rift between the brothers, the younger one wonders just what these visits to the pool might ultimately cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Cote Smith&#39;s well-received short story of the same name, &lt;i&gt;Hurt People&lt;/i&gt; will hold you in its grip to the very last page. Eerily atmospheric, lean, and forceful, this is a debut from a slyly talented new writer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
