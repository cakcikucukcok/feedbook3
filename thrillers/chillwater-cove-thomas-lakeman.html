  <title>Chillwater Cove - Thomas Lakeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;FBI special agent Peggy Weaver was ten years old when her best friend was abducted while they were riding their bikes through their small hometown in Tennessee. Peggy ran and escaped, but Samantha didn&#39;t. She was eventually found and brought home, but her rescue came only after something so terrible happened that she could never speak about it, even to Peggy. And the kidnapper was never caught.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Samantha&#39;s family forgave Peggy for running and her father admitted that she had done the smart thing, she&#39;s always wished that she could have helped Samantha. Terrified at the time, Peggy couldn&#39;t remember much besides the make of the car--not the license plate, not what the man looked like. She never has remembered anything else, and she&#39;ll never forgive herself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, twenty-five years later, pornographic photos of ten-year-old Samantha have turned up as evidence in one of Peggy&#39;s cases, a clear message from a man who&#39;s never paid for what he did, and Peggy knows that this time she isn&#39;t going to run.&lt;br&gt;With his riveting debut, &lt;i&gt;The Shadow Catchers&lt;/i&gt;, Thomas Lakeman proved himself to be one of the best new crime writers, and he follows that up with &lt;i&gt;Chillwater Cove, &lt;/i&gt;a heart-stopping sequel in his Mike Yeager and Peggy Weaver series. Loyalties may run deep but secrets can run even deeper...&lt;/p&gt;" />
