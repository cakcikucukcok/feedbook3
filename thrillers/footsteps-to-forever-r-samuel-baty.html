  <title>Footsteps to Forever - R. Samuel Baty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Footsteps&lt;/i&gt;, like Hemingway&#39;s &lt;i&gt;For Whom the Bell Tolls&lt;/i&gt; and Wouk&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Winds of War&lt;/i&gt;, is a story filled with suspense, romance, and sudden violence. It is 1941, only days after the infamous attack at Pearl Harbor. Two young army lieutenants-Jennifer, a beautiful nurse, and Jonathan, who falls in love with her almost immediately-are sent to rescue a world-famous physicist from behind German lines in Norway. The physicist had been dispatched by Roosevelt to spy on German atomic energy progress.&lt;/p&gt;
Chased by the enemy, hampered by the physicist&#39;s deteriorating health, impacted by a blossoming romance, and faced with harsh winter conditions, the two young Americans struggle to avoid disaster. An epic battle occurs-with results that echo throughout the novel.&lt;/p&gt;
The explosive action of &lt;i&gt;Footsteps&lt;/i&gt; soon expands to include the whole war-torn world, with action scenes involving the doomed Allied raid at Dieppe, the Russian Front, the Normandy D-Day invasion, and ferocious air battles in the Pacific. Fictional characters with significant roles include an American fighter pilot, a British Special Operations officer, overworked medical personnel, and a pair of German officers-one cruel, the other surprisingly tender-hearted.&lt;/p&gt;
World War II rages, and human emotions smolder, clouded by issues of conscience and morality. Survivors meet again-enemies as well as friends-in ways both dreamed of and quite shocking." />
