Released from the hospital, still weak from her ordeal, Katie took a taxi to her remote farmhouse on Black Lake. Darkness had already fallen. There was only the wind in the trees to greet her...and the cold and empty house. But the house was not quite empty. Something awaited her, upstairs in her bedroom. Something with cold, dead eyes" />
