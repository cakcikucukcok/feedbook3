  <title>The Donor - Frank M. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;You&#39;ve heard the urban legend about a man who wakes up in a tub of ice in a hotel room with a kidney missing. In fact, organ thefts are a real phenomenon and the occurrence of the crime is on the increase. The legend comes to life in this dramatic and scary story ripped from the headlines of tomorrow&#39;s newspaper.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis, a college-age young man and an adoptee, wakes up in a small private hospital in San Francisco after a minor car accident to discover that one of his organs is missing. He&#39;s an involuntary transplant donor. He flees to a municipal hospital, only to learn that this is the second organ to be harvested from him.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He runs for his life.  Clearly someone, somewhere, is a close match for him, needs his organs, and knows his every move. The next time, he might lose his heart or lungs. He won&#39;t wake up after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis heads home to Boston to confront his adoptive father, who seems to have forged his name to a donor card.  And so the hunt is on: Dennis must find his harvester before the harvester finds him again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;This is a gripping tale, extremely well told. &quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
