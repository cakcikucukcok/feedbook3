  <title>The House of Brides - Jane Cockram</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jane Cockram makes her thrilling debut with this page-turning tale of psychological suspense in which a young woman whose life is in tatters flees to the safety of a family estate in England, but instead of comfort finds chilling secrets and lies.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Miranda&amp;#8217;s life and career has been a roller-coaster ride. Her successful rise to the top of the booming lifestyle industry as a social media influencer led to a humiliating fall after a controversial product she endorsed flopped. Desperate to get away from the hate-spewing trolls shaming her on the internet, she receives a mysterious letter from a young cousin in England that plunges her into a dark family mystery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miranda&amp;#8217;s mother Tessa Summers, a famous author, died when Miranda was a child. The young woman&amp;#8217;s only connection to the Summers family is through Tessa&amp;#8217;s famous book &lt;em&gt;The House of Brides&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;a chronicle of the generations of women who married into the infamous Summers family and made their home in the rambling Barnsley House, the family&amp;#8217;s estate. From Gertrude Summers, a famed crime novelist, to Miranda&amp;#8217;s grandmother Beatrice, who killed herself after setting fire to Barnsley while her children slept, each woman in The House of Brides is more notorious than the next. The house&amp;#8217;s current &amp;#8220;bride&amp;#8221; is the beautiful, effervescent Daphne, her Uncle Max&amp;#8217;s wife&amp;#8212;a famed celebrity chef who saved Barnsley from ruin turning the estate into an exclusive culinary destination and hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about this legendary family she has never met, Miranda arrives at Barnsley posing as a prospective nanny answering an advertisement. She&amp;#8217;s greeted by the compelling yet cold housekeeper Mrs. Mins, and meets the children and her Uncle Max&amp;#8212;none of whom know her true identity. But Barnsley is not what Miranda expected. The luxury destination and award-winning restaurant is gone, and Daphne is nowhere to be found. Most disturbing, one of the children is in a wheelchair after a mysterious accident. What happened in this house? Where is Daphne? What darkness lies hidden in Barnsley?&lt;/p&gt;" />
