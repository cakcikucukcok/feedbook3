  <title>You&#39;re Next - Gregg Hurwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mike Wingate, abandoned by his father at four and raised in foster care, is finally living the life he always dreamed of--he&#39;s happily married with a precocious 8-year-old daughter, and his construction company is about to finish a &quot;green&quot; housing development that will secure a solid future for them all. But then something from his own past, a past he doesn&#39;t even remember, comes back to visit terror upon him and his family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shady characters begin threatening Mike and, when he reports them, the police seem more interested in Mike&#39;s murky past than in protecting him. Now, with Mike, his wife Annabel and daughter Kat suddenly under attack from all sides, Mike turns to Shep, a dangerous man--and Mike&#39;s only true friend-- from his childhood days in foster care. Together they will do whatever it takes to protect Mike&#39;s family against the hidden men behind the terrifying warning, &quot;You&#39;re Next.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
