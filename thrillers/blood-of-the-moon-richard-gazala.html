  <title>Blood of the Moon - Richard Gazala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Rivers is a second-generation oilman.  From Houston he runs the multinational oil company built by his father, former Apollo astronaut Michael Rivers, one of the last men alive to walk on the moon.  Michael now spends his days confined to an assisted-living facility, his mind succumbing to the ravages of Alzheimers disease.  Somewhere in Michaels crumbling memory is a devastating secret he has revealed to no one in over forty years, not even to his sole surviving child.  The secret is the location of a small capsule Michael brought back from the moon in 1972 containing proof that conventional wisdom is a deliberate lie.&lt;P&gt; &lt;BR&gt;
With the cryptic aid of an anonymous benefactor deep within the ancient and powerful secret society of the Hostmen of Newcastle, David races to unravel the mysteries shrouding his fathers legacy while wars, terrorism, and riots over dwindling oil reserves enflame the planet, and a corrupted American presidential election teeters in the balance.  David finds himself confronting the same crisis of conscience his father faced decades before.  Should he risk his life and company to expose the Hostmens lies?  Or will he bury what he uncovers and let the world burn?&lt;P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Blood of the Moon&lt;/I&gt; won Honorable Mention in its category (Mystery/Suspense/Thriller) at the Los Angeles DIY Book Festival, and won third place in the Santa Fe Trail Creative Arts Guild Book Competition in the same category.  &lt;i&gt;Blood of the Moon&lt;/i&gt; has also been named a Finalist the Next Generation Indie Awards for 2010." />
