  <title>Goliath Fell - S. M. Atwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After experiencing nightmares of the Nazi invasion of Poland, Jozef Pokoj and his bride Ana, emigrate to the United States. At the start of the Twentieth century, the Pokoj&#39;s settle in Hamtramck, Michigan, become American citizens, and change their name to Powell. Jozef eventually finds work at the Ford Motor Company.      Edward, their eldest child, is introduced to the world of photography by a family friend, Trevor Humphries. After surviving the devastating Crash, Edward convinces Humphries to expand their business. 
     Edward marries Sandra Latham, and they have a son, Christopher. When Christopher suffers a relapse of Chicken Pox  at college, and almost dies, he learns he cannot have children of his own. 
     As the photographic industry reaches it&#39;s boom, in the 1970&#39;s Powell Photographic takes it&#39;s place as one of the biggest photographic plants in the country. 
     Christopher marries a Vietnam widow, Anne Thompson, who has a son, Ben, who turns out to be of questionable character. 
     When new employee Vicki Brennan, meets Anne, a bond forms between the two, and Ben becomes threatened. 
     &quot;Goliath Fell&quot; is a story not only of human survival, financial success, civil rights, and the right to die; it is also a story of animal instinct, and why some people go to the lengths they do, not just to survive, but to succeed." />
