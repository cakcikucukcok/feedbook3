  <title>Elevator Pitch - Linwood Barclay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;One hell of a suspense novel.&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;A Noise Downstairs&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;No Time for Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; returns with an edge-of-your-seat thriller that does for elevators what &lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt; did for showers and &lt;em&gt;Jaws&lt;/em&gt; did for the beach&amp;#8212;a heart-pounding tale in which a series of disasters paralyzes New York City with fear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It all begins on a Monday, when four people board an elevator in a Manhattan office tower. Each presses a button for their floor, but the elevator proceeds, non-stop, to the top. Once there, it stops for a few seconds, and then plummets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right to the bottom of the shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It appears to be a horrific, random tragedy. But then, on Tuesday, it happens again, in a different Manhattan skyscraper. And when Wednesday brings yet another high-rise catastrophe, one of the most vertical cities in the world&amp;#8212;and the nation&amp;#8217;s capital of media, finance, and entertainment&amp;#8212;is plunged into chaos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clearly, this is anything but random. This is a cold, calculated bid to terrorize the city. And it&amp;#8217;s working. Fearing for their lives, thousands of men in women working in offices across the city refuse to leave their homes. Commerce has slowed to a trickle. Emergency calls to the top floors of apartment buildings go unanswered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is behind this? Why are they doing it? What do these deadly acts of sabotage have to do with the fingerless body found on the High Line? Two seasoned New York detectives and a straight-shooting journalist must race against time to find the answers before the city&amp;#8217;s newest, and tallest, residential tower has its ribbon-cutting on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With each diabolical twist, Linwood Barclay ratchets up the suspense, building to a shattering finale. Pulsating with tension, &lt;em&gt;Elevator Pitch&lt;/em&gt; is a riveting tale of psychological suspense that is all too plausible . . . and will chill readers to the bone.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
