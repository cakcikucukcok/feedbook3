    &lt;p&gt;
        Nickolas Landry; Martial Arts instructor, model citizen, and former Navy SEAL. Years ago, after leaving the Navy, he was confronted by an ancient
        little man from Japan, who claimed that Nick was destined to serve as the Guardian of mankind. His duty, until the end of times, is to safeguard
        humanity from the forces of darkness. This destiny came with a warning, explained by Masamoto that this duty would destroy the life Nick knows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        When the time came, after years of training, Nick learned first hand how true the warning was. He believed that he possessed the strength and ability
        to protect his life and the loved ones in it. On the eve of his wedding, he was shown how wrong he was, when his bride to be was taken from him, along
        with Masamoto, losing her life because of his destiny.
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;
        How does a man give his life to save the rest of mankind? Sure, he could&#39;ve walked away and denied his destiny. But, how could he carry on with his
        life knowing that the future of mankind is doomed on Earth? Nickolas Landry is not that kind of man, but with the end of times near, he will soon learn
        the extent of this so-called destiny that has consumed his life, and what it will truly cost him. Allies have been made, with more to come to fight at
        his side, on this eve of doom. It is then that Nick will discover what the ultimate sacrifice is to save the word.
    &lt;/p&gt;
