Enter Jake Stevens: wealthy, arrogant, and interested in buying Lynda&amp;rsquo;s beloved Piper. Together he and Lynda embark on a test flight that ends in disaster&amp;mdash;hurling them into a terrifying sequence of events. One thing becomes clear: Someone is out to get Lynda . . . someone who will not be satisfied until she is dead. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;Justifiable Means&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;A violent criminal with a knack for evading justice. A beautiful victim with a secret to hide. Between them stands one good cop, torn between justice and the law. This rape case is an exception: The victim is more than willing to testify. And there&amp;rsquo;s abundant evidence to put the suspect behind bars. Just one thing bothers Detective Larry Millsaps. Young and beautiful Melissa Nelson seems to know almost too much about the evidence needed to convict her attacker. The unfolding investigation unearths a brutal track record on the part of the suspect . . . and a stunning revelation of Melissa&amp;rsquo;s own haunting past that could do far worse than destroy her credibility.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;Ulterior Motives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family: Calibri;&quot;&gt;Louis Dubose, international art dealer, has been murdered.

Except that one person isn&amp;rsquo;t convinced&amp;mdash;someone who knows Ben well. Knows that he&amp;rsquo;s quite capable of trashing human lives but not of taking them. Now that person is about to gamble her own well-being on his innocence . . . when her personal indictment against him may be almost as bitter as murder.

Someone else is hot on Beth Wright&amp;rsquo;s trail&amp;mdash;someone who wants to make sure her story never sees the press. Between them stands Nick Hutchins, a social worker who finds his own gut hunches about the children&amp;rsquo;s home increasingly confirmed, first by Beth&amp;rsquo;s investigation . . . then by a high-speed attempt on her life . . . and finally, by an intruder&amp;rsquo;s startling confession.&lt;/p&gt;" />
