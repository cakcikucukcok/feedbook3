  <title>The Journey to Justice - Easha Nasir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is about two women who loved the same man: Sam. His undeniable charm and kind gestures made them fall in love with him, but unfortunately, he later became their biggest mistake. Sam was an ordinary man with an extraordinary sense of crime, and he knew how to play with lives. 
As a young man, he was really handsome with a lean build. As soon as Macy was introduced to him, she just fell for him, and frequent meetings continued. During their meetings, Sam confided in Macy and told her about the abuse he suffered as a teenager and how the gruesome abuse affected his mental health, but he made sure that Macy knew that he was totally fine and eligible to marry her. 
Her mind said something else, but her heart was totally filled with Sams love, and living without him for even a second felt like years. She decided to talk to her dad about their marriage. 
As a protective father, he put a lot of thought into this big decision and finally agreed upon the proposal, which meant that the first step to Sams master plan was successful. He was not deeply in love with Macy, but he rather fell for the money offered in this relationship. He was very greedy and selfish and didnt make any true commitments. 
He joined the business and was soon made the CEO of the company while Mr Anderson blindly trusted him for everything and came to the company for random visits. 
But one fateful evening, he was gruesomely murdered by none other than Sam. Unfortunately, the police was too late to stop this from happening, so Sam happily lived with his wife, Macy, who now had the power and property in her hands. 
Sam devised a plan to destroy her completely and flee to Melbourne where he lived a posh life and impressed another woman, Helena. This time, he just wanted to play with lives and scar them slowly and steadilyhis old disgusting pleasure. Everything was going smoothly until Chloe knocked on Sams door and became his ultimate dream. She was bold, sexy, and professional. 
What could attract his senses more? Now he had a mission, and it was to destroy Helenas life. 
He began by having an affair with Chloe and started abusing Jenny, Jack, and Anna every day for about a month, which scarred their lives forever. Jenny finally opened up, and her mother was on the hunt for clues when she met Chloe, Sams biggest mistake from the past. 
Mysteries began unfolding, and they got together with the most hardworking officers and embarked on a journey of justice and hope." />
