  <title>Waiting - Frank M. Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the author who brought us the distinguished spy thriller&lt;i&gt; Death of a Marionette&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Towering Inferno&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most popular films of the &#39;70s, comes &lt;i&gt;Waiting&lt;/i&gt;, an intense novel of contemporary menace, in the mode of Robinson&#39;s 1950s classic,&lt;i&gt; The Power&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are people living among us, who look just like normal human beings. They&#39;ve been here for a long time--waiting. But they aren&#39;t exactly like us at all. Some of them can read minds, and in subtle ways take over what your are thinking, control you for a while.&lt;br&gt;They can make you love. &lt;br&gt;They can make you die.&lt;br&gt;One ordinary man in San Francisco, Arthur Banks, begins to find them out, and immediately his life and his family are in danger. It&#39;s a paranoid&#39;s worst nightmare. But that&#39;s just where it starts. He may well be fighting for the survival of the entire human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&#39;ve always maintained that Frank M. Robinson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Power&lt;/i&gt; was one of the best terror tales ever told. &lt;i&gt;Waiting &lt;/i&gt;is even better, rich with character, suspense and constant surprise. This is one of the best chillers of the entire decade. It is guaranteed to give you nightmares. Reading this book was a pure pleasure.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Mystery Scene&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
