  <title>Chain of Custody - Scott I. Zucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Chain of Custody, Matt Taggart is a hard working young associate attorney at a prestigious Washington, D.C. litigation firm. He is married with a one year old daughter. Matts day to day life is unremarkable until his father, a U.S. Senator, is killed in a small plane crash. Was his death a suicide or was he killed?  Assisted by a woman investigator from the National Transportation and Safety Bureau, Matt begins his quest to learn the reason for his fathers death. During his investigation, Matt finds himself drawn into the corrupt world of defense contractors and the inter-workings of the Pentagon. As Matt gets closer to the answer, Matt must balance the work of his law firm, the ethical dilemmas of defending a large pharmaceutical company in a wrongful death case and his feelings for his wife as he becomes emotionally closer to the woman that is sharing his adventure. 
Throughout the story the reader is pressed to answer some questions. What would you do if a death was ruled to be a suicide but you didnt believe the report? How hard would you look to find the truth? What would you do if you discovered a lie? Would your answer change if along the way anyone who knew the truth ended up dead?" />
