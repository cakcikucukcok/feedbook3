  <title>The Edge of Normal - Carla Norton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&#39;&#39;Norton has given us living, breathing characters that we know and understand . . . and who inhabit our imaginations after we&#39;ve finished this book.&quot; --Jeffery Deaver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Reeve LeClaire looks like a typical twenty-two year old girl. She&#39;s finally landed her own apartment, she waitresses to pay the bills, and she wishes she wasn&#39;t so nervous around new people. She thinks of herself as agile, not skittish. As serious, not grim. But Reeve is anything but normal. &lt;br&gt;Ten years ago, she was kidnapped and held captive. After a lucky escape, she&#39;s spent the last six years trying to rebuild her life, a recovery thanks in large part to her indispensable therapist Dr. Ezra Lerner. But when he asks her to help another girl rescued from a similar situation, Reeve realizes she may not simply need to mentor this young victim--she may be the only one who can protect her from a cunning predator who is still out there, watching every move.&lt;br&gt;From the author of the #1 non-fiction bestseller &lt;i&gt;Perfect Victim: The True Story of the Girl in the Box&lt;/i&gt; comes a novel that draws you into a chilling and engrossing world. With masterful plot twists and shifting points of view that make it as irresistible as &lt;i&gt;Gone Girl,&lt;/i&gt; Carla Norton&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Edge of Normal&lt;/i&gt; is a stunning debut thriller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
