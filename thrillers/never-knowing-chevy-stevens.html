  <title>Never Knowing - Chevy Stevens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Still Missing&lt;/i&gt; comes a psychological thriller about one woman&#39;s search into her past and the deadly truth she uncovers.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All her life, Sara Gallagher has wondered about her birth parents. As an adopted child with two sisters who were born naturally to her parents, Sara did not have an ideal home life. The question of why she was given up for adoption has always haunted her. Finally, she is ready to take steps and to find closure.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But some questions are better left unanswered. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After months of research, Sara locates her birth mother---only to be met with horror and rejection. Then she discovers the devastating truth: Her mother was the only victim ever to escape a killer who has been hunting women every summer for decades. But Sara soon realizes the only thing worse than finding out about her father is him finding out about her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if murder is in your blood? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Never Knowing&lt;/i&gt; is a complex and compelling portrayal of one woman&#39;s quest to understand herself, her origins, and her family. That is, if she can survive. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
