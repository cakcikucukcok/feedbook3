  <title>The German Task - Thorvald Lygum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We write 1977. The cold war is raging, but master instructor Lars Steensen has enough to do with his own war. A war against creditors. 
After a serius riding accident it seems he has lost the battle, but in the hospital he receives an unexspected visit. Two officers from NATO intelligence ask him do do a job for them. 
A rather simple task. So it seems, and he is not in a situation, that invite to refuse. 
The assignment brings him around on the north German competitions camps, but the simple task turns out to be a lot more complicated than assumed. 
And a lot more dangerous.

An exellent thriller.
