  <title>Nightbirds - Lawrence M. James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nightbirds is the graphic and violent story of a serial killer and two FBI agents who are trying to stop him before he becomes the most prolific serial killer in United States history. Driven by events that occurred many years before and a perspective that requires his own form of brutal redemption, the killer quickly targets and murders each victim, leaving behind a body and a signature in the trophy he takes from each of them. The principal characters include Lou Mark (a relatively young FBI agent with a unique gift), Tom Anglen (an experienced FBI agent who has worked in the Serial Killer Division for twenty years), their families, the victims, and the killer. Mark and Anglen track the serial killer from one city to another through the women he chooses, all of whom are strikingly similar in age and appearance. At each crime scene, as Mark and Anglen see what appears to have been consensual sex, followed almost immediately by a savage murder, they realize that they have to understand the legend of the nightbirds to catch the killer. The author is working on a sequel to Nightbirds, which should be available later this year." />
