  <title>The Ghost Between Us - Pete Nunweiler, Wilkinson Laura</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#39;ll quickly connect with the characters in this captivating paranormal thriller. &amp;nbsp;With a cliff hanger at the close of every chapter, you won&amp;#39;t want to put it down.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toby and Anna Miller were a perfect couple. Romantic, passionate and truly best friends. When he loses her after a car accident, he takes a leave of absence from work to carry out his promise to Anna and moves to the &amp;quot;Forever House&amp;quot; in the mountains of Tennessee. It&amp;#39;s their dream come true carried out by one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Soon after he settles in, he hears strange noises in the house but brushes them off until his realtor, Alex, shares a dark secret with him and he learns of her heartbreaking connection to the house. Over time, Toby and Alex become closer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a paranormal enthusiast, Toby no longer dismisses the strange noises and tries to connect with the entity in the house. His research begins with simple closed-ended questions and progresses to full conversations through EVPs and a Spirit Box. Toby&amp;#39;s increasing obsession with the paranormal builds an obsession with the ghost, sparking a forbidden love triangle.&lt;br /&gt;
Will the entity keep Toby and Alex apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Ghost Between Us is where paranormal romance meets suspense thriller. It will grab you from the very first page and won&amp;#39;t let go until the last.&lt;/p&gt;" />
