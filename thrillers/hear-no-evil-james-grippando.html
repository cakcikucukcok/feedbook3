  <title>Hear No Evil - James Grippando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Miami attorney Jack Swyteck is involved in the most explosive criminal trial of his career -- a case that starts with a murder on a military base and concludes with a shocking surprise that will change Jack&#39;s life forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautiful woman comes to see Jack and begs him to represent her. She says she&#39;s about to be arrested for the murder of her husband, an officer stationed at Guantanamo Bay. Having no expertise in military law and sensing that the woman isn&#39;t telling him the entire truth, Jack turns her down. Then she drops a bombshell: She claims she&#39;s the adoptive mother of Jack&#39;s biological son -- a child he&#39;s never met. Either Jack must represent her or he&#39;ll never see the boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Jack agrees, but with great foreboding. He has an unreliable client -- a blackmailer who just might be a murderer -- and he has to travel to Gitmo and on to Havana to tussle with people who clearly have a lot to hide. This is a case with as many twists and turns as it has unanswered questions, and the personal toll on Jack won&#39;t end until he&#39;s forced to confront the ultimate surprise witness in a trial that rocks the city of Miami.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In signature Grippando style,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Hear No Evil&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is an intricate, fast-paced, and captivating thriller that will keep you guessing until the very end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
