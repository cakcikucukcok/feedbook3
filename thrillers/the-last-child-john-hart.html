  <title>The Last Child - John Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winner of the 2010 Edgar Award for Best Novel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heralded by the &lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt; as a &lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;/b&gt;a magnificent creation, Huck Finn channeled through &lt;i&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/i&gt;&quot;&lt;b&gt;, &lt;/b&gt;John Hart&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Last Child &lt;/i&gt;is his most significant work to date, an intricate, powerful story of loss, hope, and courage in the face of evil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thirteen year-old Johnny Merrimon had the perfect life: a warm home and loving parents; a twin sister, Alyssa, with whom he shared an irreplaceable bond. He knew nothing of loss, until the day Alyssa vanished from the side of a lonely street. Now, a year later, Johnny finds himself isolated and alone, failed by the people he&#39;d been taught since birth to trust. No one else believes that Alyssa is still alive, but Johnny is certain that she is---confident in a way that he can never fully explain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to find his sister, Johnny risks everything to explore the dark side of his hometown. It is a desperate, terrifying search, but Johnny is not as alone as he might think. Detective Clyde Hunt has never stopped looking for Alyssa either, and he has a soft spot for Johnny. He watches over the boy and tries to keep him safe, but when Johnny uncovers a dangerous lead and vows to follow it, Hunt has no choice but to intervene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then a second child goes missing . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undeterred by Hunt&#39;s threats or his mother&#39;s pleas, Johnny enlists the help of his last friend, and together they plunge into the wild, to a forgotten place with a history of violence that goes back more than a hundred years. There, they meet a giant of a man, an escaped convict on his own tragic quest. What they learn from him will shatter every notion Johnny had about the fate of his sister; it will lead them to another far place, to a truth that will test both boys to the limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traveling the wilderness between innocence and hard wisdom, between hopelessness and faith, &lt;i&gt;The Last Child&lt;/i&gt; leaves all categories behind and establishes John Hart as a writer of unique power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now with an excerpt from John Hart&#39;s next book &lt;i&gt;The Hush&lt;/i&gt;, available in February 2018.&lt;/p&gt;" />
