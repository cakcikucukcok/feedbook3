  <title>Fatal Impeachment - Wayne Beyea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Back Cover Text: A tenacious young State Police Investigator develops circumstantial evidence identifying a suspect in a rape/murder case. Incredibly, that suspect is the President of the United States. The murder was committed while he was a student in college and went unsolved for 25 years.
President Thurston Winslow is an extremely powerful and popular president, and when he realizes that State Police Investigator Ron Keston is investigating him, wields his power and has Keston assassinated. Lieutenant Richard Miranda, Kestons supervisor, commences an investigation and survives a diabolical attempt to destroy his career and, later, an attempt at assassination because of intuition, intelligence, skill and lots of luck.
Miranda utilizes his own brand of diabolical skill to develop prima facie evidence against the President, but is unable to cause his arrest and flounders in frustration. The President seems above the law and too powerful for prosecution. By fate or divine intervention, Miranda connects with the rape/murder victims brother and sister who, over the course of years since their sisters death, entered careers which provide them access to the President.
A race begins to destroy the most powerful man in the world before he destroys them. Who wins? The excitement mounts and climaxes in a crescendo of irony. Author Bio: Wayne Beyea is presently Juvenile Justice Coordinator, Clinton County, New York." />
