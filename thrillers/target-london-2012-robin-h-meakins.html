      <meta name="description" content="Secret agent Ian Shaw dreamed of bombs destroying the London Olympics stadium to start a new Fire of London not knowing if it was
a premonition or a warning. He forgot it until he overheard a plot to destroy the Eurostar inside the Channel Tunnel that eventually he
stopped by reluctantly killing two bombers. Then he retired to forget his wifes murder. He was recalled to translate Arabic documents
so saving the London Barrage and starting the hunt for Abdullahs &lt;i&gt;Death to the Infidels&lt;/i&gt; and his wifes murderer. Was there a link? He
returned to Saudi Arabia to search among the Bedouin for Abdullah to trace him to France, England and Florida. It was a fight against a
giant octopus with tentacles everywhere funded by drug money. He and his colleagues had to solve a jigsaw puzzle to find the terrorists
before they attacked football stadiums and the London Olympics to kill or maim thousands. It was a race against time to destroy those
people apparently living normal lives while waiting to wreak mayhem. Until they were eliminated no one was safe as all around death lurked killing everyone who opposed terrorism." />
