  <title>Dead Souls - Angela Marsons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;The truth was dead and buried&amp;#x2026; until now.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a collection of human bones is unearthed during a routine archaeological dig, a Black Country field suddenly becomes a complex crime scene for &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the bones are sorted, it becomes clear that the grave contains more than one victim. The bodies hint at unimaginable horror, bearing the markings of bullet holes and animal traps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forced to work alongside Detective Travis, with whom she shares a troubled past, Kim begins to uncover a dark secretive relationship between the families who own the land in which the bodies were found. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But while Kim is immersed in one of the most complicated investigations she&amp;#x2019;s ever led, her team are caught up in a spate of sickening hate crimes. Kim is close to revealing the truth behind the murders, yet soon finds one of her own is in jeopardy - and the clock is ticking. Can she solve the case and save them from grave danger &amp;#x2013; before it&amp;#x2019;s too late?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt; An addictive, sinister crime thriller that will have readers on the edge of their seat.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about Dead Souls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Hooked&lt;/b&gt; from the very first page ...
