  <title>Under the Influence - Richard Uhl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Roger Franklin is caught in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and survives, he seizes the opportunity to disappear, relocate, and reinvent himself. It seems to be a better option than staying in New York, where a horrifying accident two years before ruined his marriageand his life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Reinventing himself as Rex Franklin, he finds happiness and success in San Diego, California, where he remarries and enjoys a second career. Working for a political big shot definitely has its perks. Twenty years later, however, ghosts from his past reenter his life, turning his world upside down. The man responsible for the accident all those years ago is back, and his ex-wife has found out hes alive.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Fighting to protect his family and save his business, he is forced to make choices that could very well destroy everything hes worked so hard to build. But if he doesnt do something, and fast, he might not have anything left to live for.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Gritty and fast-paced, &lt;i&gt;Under the Influence&lt;/i&gt; is an action-packed novel that speaks to the power of tragedy and redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
