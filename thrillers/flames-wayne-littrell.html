  <title>Flames - Wayne Littrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After his brother dies, Sam Forest is traumatized when the cremation goes horribly wrongbut the bad times have only just begun. Without knowing why two professional killers are after him, Sam saves his cousins from certain torture and death in a staged home invasion. When others involved are murdered in heinous ways, Sam is framed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Innocent and on the run, he is forced to seek refuge with a mysterious road dogs biker family while the only cop that believes in his innocence is the first detective that questioned him. Unexpectedly, Sam finds love with Betsy, who is soon fighting for her life as Sam and his friends face off against outlaw bikers, serial killers, corrupt lawmen, and a secret smuggling organization that will do anything to protect itself from discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All seems hopeless as Sam and his brothers-of-the-wind mix with old-school bikers, moonshiners, pot growers, and ruthless killers while chasing leads across the southeast. Together, they must risk all to prove Sams innocence by finding the actual killers and uncovering their deadly secrets and motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lone Wolfs Run put me on my motorcycle and took me on a tour that had me stopping only for fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
