  <title>Two Lives Unconnected - Simoneux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The life of a woman gets turned around when she finds her husband is not who she thought he was. She engages her childhood friend, who is a private investigator, to help her unravel what has happened to her husband.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As children they read mystery books. They graduated to working for the people in town. Then they expanded to working around the country. As they step into this latest episode, they interview many people, and they become victims of an attacker who sends their van rolling over and off the road.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Hospitalized, they are befriended by a doctor who helps them elude their enemy. In the course of their mystery, they have to go into dark caves with guards throughout. There are also creatures in the caves that keep them on their toes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The duo does such an outstanding job that the Federal Bureau of Investigations hears of their exploits and hires them to trap the gang, which is operating around the country. They go back into the caves where the gang is based to gather information about the gang&amp;rsquo;s operations and its leaders. The FBI trains the couple and gives them lightweight equipment, plus bugs to enlighten them more about the illicit activities.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They are led on an ever-escalating adventure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
