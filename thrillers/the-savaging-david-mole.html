  <title>The Savaging - David Mole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The greatest scientific leap in history has been made... unleashed in one tiny, little &amp;ldquo;remedy&amp;rdquo;. Its creator, billionaire playboy Dr. Fabian Fichtinger, is set to become a global superpower with his new &amp;ldquo;Trinity Therapy&amp;rdquo;, soon to be released. The government, the church, and the good scientists at Harvard University can do nothing to stop him from creating superhuman... addicts. They might even be involved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tes is one such scientist, with his own special research in genetics. Although the ultimate 23-year-old thoroughbred &amp;ndash; intellectually, psychically, athletically &amp;ndash; he&amp;rsquo;s always known there was something just not right inside. When Fichtinger becomes obsessed with him, he knows he&amp;rsquo;s in great danger.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No country is safe, no market prepared, no hospital ready. What is to come will bring modern civilization to its knees. Everything rests with Tes, and his secret. Luckily, he&amp;rsquo;s not alone. Help comes in the form of a drunk, PTSD-suffering ex-soldier called Royce, who was once part of an elite secret troop: The Savage Seven.&lt;br /&gt;
Can he get his former squad back together? Can this ragtag bunch of once-great fighters get clean, get organized and get tough? Are they too late? Is anything what it seems?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;History&amp;rsquo;s greatest deception is soon to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
