  <title>Blood Lines - Angela Marsons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;h2&gt;How do you catch a killer who leaves no trace?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A victim killed with a single, precise stab to the heart appears at first glance to be a robbery gone wrong. A caring, upstanding social worker lost to a senseless act of violence. But for &lt;b&gt;Detective Kim Stone&lt;/b&gt;, something doesn&amp;#x2019;t add up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a local drug addict is found murdered with an identical wound, Kim knows instinctively that she is dealing with the same killer. But with nothing to link the two victims except the cold, calculated nature of their death, this could be her most difficult case yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Desperate to catch the twisted individual, Kim&amp;#x2019;s focus on the case is threatened when she receives a chilling letter from &lt;b&gt;Dr Alex Thorne&lt;/b&gt;, the sociopath who Kim put behind bars. And this time, Alex is determined to hit where it hurts most, bringing Kim face-to-face with the woman responsible for the death of Kim&amp;#x2019;s little brother &amp;#x2013; her own mother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the body count increases, Kim and her team unravel a web of dark secrets, bringing them closer to the killer. But one of their own could be in mortal danger. Only this time, Kim might not be strong enough to save them&amp;#x2026;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;A totally gripping thriller that will have you hooked from the very first page to the final, dramatic twist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;Blood Lines&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;My heart didn&amp;#x2019;t beat right the whole way through this one! &lt;b&gt;I actually had to read this on the floor as the edge of my seat was too uncomfortable!&lt;/b&gt; It is a real rollercoaster of a ride &amp;#x2026; this is one book you do NOT want to miss!&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Emma the Little Book Worm (5*)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;With no let up in pace, the author &lt;b&gt;doesn&#39;t give you time to catch your breath before she hits you with another shocking twist.&lt;/b&gt; I can honestly say &lt;i&gt;Blood Lines&lt;/i&gt; &lt;b&gt;kept me guessing right up to the last nail biting chapter&lt;/b&gt;, don&#39;t you just love it when a book does that?&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;The Book Review Caf&amp;#xe9; (5*)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;this character is &lt;b&gt;the best nemesis to any character since Hannibal Lecter tormented Clarice Starling&lt;/b&gt; &amp;#x2026; the Detective Inspector Kim Stone books are &lt;b&gt;nothing short of brilliant.&amp;#x2019;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Nigel Adams Book Worm (5*)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;I love this series, and &lt;b&gt;Angela Marsons has joined the ranks of authors I would drop anything else I was doing to read&lt;/b&gt;, and whose books I put on pre-order without even stopping to read the blurb.&amp;#x2019; &lt;i&gt;Jen Med&amp;#x2019;s Book Reviews (5*)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;Gripping &amp;#x2026; so many twists and turns&lt;/b&gt;, as you try to fathom who is responsible for the murders; it&#39;s going to keep you guessing all the way through that&#39;s for sure! &amp;#x2026; fast paced with plenty of &lt;b&gt;psychological mind games that will leave you reeling.&amp;#x2019;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Chapter In My Life (5*)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;It is a gripping, emotional and addictive read.
