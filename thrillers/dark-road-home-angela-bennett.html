  <title>Dark Road Home - Angela Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Victor Simone, head of a hit man organization, murdered Belle McBains corrupt father. Following in her dads career footsteps, Belle becomes an attorney, but she cant seem to move beyond the whispers of her crooked fathers corruption or his failures to his family. Instead of building a career in law, she escapes to a life of drugs and lives off her trust fund. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to cope, Belle attempts suicide and is soon admitted into a rehab clinic where she tries to heal. However, her wounds run deep, so the healing takes time. Once released and three years sober, Belle begins a new life as a private investigator in Jersey City with the help of a friend in law enforcement. Sixteen years have passed  until everything changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of Victor Simones cronies is in FBI custody and makes a deal. He says hell tell where the fugitive Simone is hiding if Belle agrees to meet with him. When she does, she begins to wonder if her father was ever a dirty attorney at all. As she searches for answers, Belle discovers more than she bargained for, including something more unbelievable than she could have imagined.&lt;/p&gt;" />
