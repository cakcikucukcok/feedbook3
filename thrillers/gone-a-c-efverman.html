  <title>GONE - A. C. Efverman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three teenage boys disappear from an exclusive suburb in Sydney.
The kidnappers contact the boys&#39; families - but two of the boys&#39; dead bodies are found floating in the harbour before any ransom sums have been paid.
DS Morgan Callaghan has taken time off work for personal reasons, but now he&#39;s called in to lead the investigations of the kidnappings and the murders - and once again, Morgan must face cruelty and violent deaths...
During the course of the investigations, it becomes known that inner organs have gone missing from bodies at the city morgue - have the boys been killed so their organs can be sold on the black market for organ transplants?
This story will take you on a journey through Sydney - where you will encounter incredibly wealthy people, complicated relationships, illegal drugs, and violent murders.
You will also get to follow the police investigations closely - all the way to the disturbing end..." />
