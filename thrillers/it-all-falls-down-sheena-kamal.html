  <title>It All Falls Down - Sheena Kamal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The brilliant, fearless, deeply flawed Nora Watts&amp;#8212;introduced in the &quot;utterly compelling&quot; (Jeffery Deaver) atmospheric thriller &lt;em&gt;The Lost Ones&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;finds deadly trouble as she searches for the truth about her&amp;#160;late father in this immersive thriller that moves from the hazy Canadian Pacific Northwest to the gritty, hollowed streets of Detroit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Nora Watts only knew one parent&amp;#8212;her father. When he killed himself, she denied her grief and carried on with her life. Then a chance encounter with a veteran who knew him raises disturbing questions Nora can&amp;#8217;t ignore&amp;#8212;and dark emotions she can&amp;#8217;t control. To make her peace with the past, she has to confront it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finding the truth about her father&amp;#8217;s life and his violent death takes her from Vancouver to Detroit where Sam Watts grew up, far away from his people and the place of his birth. Thanks to a disastrous government policy starting in the 1950s, thousands of Canadian native children like Sam were adopted by American families. In the Motor City, Nora discovers that the circumstances surrounding Sam&amp;#8217;s suicide are more unsettling than she&amp;#8217;d imagined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet no matter how far away Nora gets from Vancouver, she can&amp;#8217;t shake trouble. Back in the Pacific Northwest, former police detective turned private investigator Jon Brazuca is looking into the overdose death of a billionaire&amp;#8217;s mistress. His search uncovers a ruthless opiate ring and a startling connection to Nora, the infuriatingly distant woman he&amp;#8217;d once tried to befriend. He has no way to warn or protect her, because she&amp;#8217;s become a ghost, vanishing completely off the grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Focused on the mysterious events of her father&amp;#8217;s past and the clues they provide to her own fractured identity and that of her estranged daughter, Nora may not be able to see the danger heading her way until it&amp;#8217;s too late. But it&amp;#8217;s not her father&amp;#8217;s old ties that could get her killed&amp;#8212;it&amp;#8217;s her own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
