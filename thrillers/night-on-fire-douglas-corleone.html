  <title>Night on Fire - Douglas Corleone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kevin Corvelli---a hotshot New York defense attorney who packed up his bags and hung his shingle in Hawaii to dodge the spotlight---is deep in his mai tais at a resort when an argument erupts down at the other end of the bar. It&#39;s a pair of newlyweds, married that very day on the beach. And since Corvelli doesn&#39;t do divorces, he all but dismisses the argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s at least until the fire breaks out later that night, and he barely escapes his hotel room. Most weren&#39;t so lucky, including the new husband. His wife, Erin, becomes not only the police&#39;s prime suspect for arson and murder but also Corvelli&#39;s newest client, and she has a lot working against her, like motive and opportunity, not to mention a history of starting fires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heat gets turned all the way up in Douglas Corleone&#39;s scorching legal thriller &lt;i&gt;Night on Fire&lt;/i&gt;, his second following the MB/MWA&#39;s First Crime Novel Competition winner, &lt;i&gt;One Man&#39;s Paradise&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
