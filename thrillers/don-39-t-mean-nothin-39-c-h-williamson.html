  <title>Don&#39;t Mean Nothin&#39; - C.H. Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fasten your seat belt, lock and load, and get ready to read about the most secret unit of the Vietnam War. Discover why and how it was formed, how it planned and conducted its actual operations, and how both its US and indigenous elements fought and died in a covert war that never made the headlines because their actions and employment locations were too classified. Get an insiders look into the most sensitive and classified operation of the entire Vietnam War; a covert raid into mainland China; a Top Secret mission that never came to light, either during or after that conflict! Find out who authorized it and why, and  discover how it was planned and executed; and why China never acknowledged that it actually happened. Tag along with a Green Beret Team as they recruit and train 350 Nung Chinese mercenaries to successfully conduct it, and defying off the chart odds when they actually accomplish it! Lastly, uncover why the raid itself was essential in preventing a major escalation of the War; one so dangerous it threatened all of Southeast Asia. And discover why its success prevented a superpower confrontation where all options, including the nuclear one, were on the table!" />
