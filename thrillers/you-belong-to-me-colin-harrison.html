  <title>You Belong to Me - Colin Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The long-awaited new novel by &quot;the class act of the urban thriller&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YOU BELONG TO ME . . . Paul Reeves is a successful immigration lawyer, but his passion is collecting old maps of New York, tangible records of the city&#39;s rich history in an increasingly digital world. One afternoon he attends an auction with his neighbor Jennifer Mehraz, the beautiful young wife of an Iranian financier-lawyer, but halfway through the auction a handsome man in soldier fatigues appears in the aisle and whisks Jennifer away. YOU BELONG TO ME . . . A long-lost lover from Jennifer&#39;s rural Pennsylvania past, the man sets off a series of alarming events as those close to Jennifer try to figure out who he is and how the two are connected, including her high-powered and possessive husband, whose ultimate goal is to make this embarrassing intrusion into his marriage disappear. YOU BELONG TO ME . . . At the same time, one of the world&#39;s rarest and most inaccessible maps suddenly goes on sale, but before Paul can finalize a deal, another buyer snatches it out from under Paul&#39;s nose, sending him on a quest to find out who the mysterious buyer is and how to get the map for himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight years after his last critically acclaimed thriller, &lt;i&gt;The Finder&lt;/i&gt;, Colin Harrison returns with &lt;i&gt;You Belong to Me&lt;/i&gt;. Filled with compelling characters and a loving but biting satire of New York City, &lt;i&gt;You Belong to Me&lt;/i&gt; is an exceptional novel, and Colin Harrison is at the top of his game.&lt;/p&gt;" />
