        &lt;p&gt;A WANTED WOMAN&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clarissa Jones is running for her life. Though she has no idea why her ex-boss wants her dead, the killers at her heels are very real. Deep in the Montana woods she finds what seems like the perfect hideout, in Ezra Jefferson&#39;s survival training school. The ex-military outdoorsman has the skills and training to keep her safe… but only if she&#39;ll lower her defenses enough to let him help. When her attackers close in, Ezra&#39;s protection and Clarissa&#39;s fierce determination are all that will keep her alive-while the growing bond between them gives her a reason to fight to survive.&lt;/p&gt;
