  <title>Get Out Now! - Barbara Harrison, Athina Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beautiful, na&amp;iuml;ve Amber Light, falls in love with a tortured artist named Cade Raine. From the first moment she meets him, she is absolutely smitten. Not only is he incredibly handsome, but also successful and wealthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;They marry soon after. Without realising it, suddenly, Amber&amp;rsquo;s entire world revolves around this one man, who isolates her from family and friends then overtly turns against her. He does this subtly at first, allowing Amber to believe that everything which goes wrong in their relationship, is her fault. That is, until she begins to uncover the truth about her husband&amp;rsquo;s dark side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout a turbulent marriage of ten years, there are many twist and turns along Amber&amp;rsquo;s journey with Cade. She eventually understands that she needs to get out of her sham of a marriage. The problem is that she knows Cade won&amp;rsquo;t allow her to leave, so she must craft a fool-proof plan to escape.&lt;/p&gt;" />
