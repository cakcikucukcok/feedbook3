  <title>The Thornhill Secret - Caroline Curran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She heard a door closing and then the sound of footsteps getting closer and closer. She tried to control her breathing as she hid.  The person was getting closer to her hiding place.
1925
Amidst the Ossipee mountains in New Hampshire a gunshot is heard in the distance. A few days later a young woman is dead.
1950
At Balmoral Castle in Scotland, the King and Queen are enjoying their summer holiday away from the hustle and bustle of London. During their visit the Queen&#39;s pearl-drop earrings go missing.  A few weeks later the housekeeper is found dead.
1999
As a writer of historical novels, Victoria Green, is very good at research. A little too good, perhaps, to suit at least one keeper of the Thornhill Secret, who apparently will stop at nothing to end Victoria&#39;s prying into the Thornhill family. Victoria is the descendent of Todd Thornhill, a department store magnate who built the magnificent Thornhill Manor, one of Victoria&#39;s favourite holiday spots.
On her most recent visit to her great-aunt, Elizabeth Thornhill, the heir to the Manor, she is put in her great-aunt Emily&#39;s old room. While looking through some bookshelves, Victoria discovers a hidden box that contains Emily&#39;s journal from 1925.  Victoria is enthralled when she reads the journal, packed with Emily&#39;s vivid descriptions of life on the estate.
The journal hints that Emily&#39;s untimely death was anything but an accident. Intrigued, Victoria, begins a search to unravel the Thornhill Secret.  What really happened to Emily Thornhill, and who was responsible for her death?" />
