Smith of the super-secret agency CURE worries the first salvo in a new border dispute has been fired.  His worst fears are realized with the appearance of the charismatic Santa Ana, a uniformed, would-be despot with a silver tongue and a thirst for bloody revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;General Santa Anna has redrawn the border between the U.S. and Mexico to fit his own twisted version of reality, and thousands of illegal aliens are drawn to his message of liberation.  The Southwest is on fire, and as the revolution explodes the entire nation is at risk.  It seems the brazen general has planned for every eventuality.
