  <title>Wheels of Fortune - J.T. Fisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Professional cyclist Shamus McDonough suffers the physical agonies of a high speed crash and the emotional trauma of the death of a beloved teammate in a tragic accident at the Tour de France.  
He becomes entangled in an international criminal investigation when it becomes apparent this accident may have been intentionally caused by dark figures lurking around the edges of the sport in a well organized syndicate harvesting enormous sums of money selling performance enhancing drugs to athletes. 
Amid these dangerous underworld figures, lives and livelihoods of hundreds of nervous athletes hang in the balance between the risks of being caught using these drugs, and of failing to win in a business that demands success.  
Shamus navigates dangerously within this netherworld as he confronts his own demons in the pursuit of setting things right, which he feels compelled to do out of loyalty and respect for his fallen colleague, and out of a profound sense of guilt that will continue to haunt him until he finds the truth.  
Along the way he encounters the rollercoaster effects of an ill-fated first love, and the bliss of letting go and finding the life-partner to travel with him when he finds the path hed earlier planned no longer accommodates him.
Then there&#39;s a really cool ending." />
