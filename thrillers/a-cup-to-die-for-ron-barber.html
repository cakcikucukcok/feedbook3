  <title>A Cup to Die For - Ron Barber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Before there was &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; there was &quot;A Cup To Die For.&quot;
When a world famous Tunisian archaeologist finds the Holy Grail on a remote archaeological dig on the north coast of Tunisia, intrigue and violence spread across the globe like ripples on a pond. The Grail turns out to be not the mystical cup of legend, but a document that holds a secret so awesome and terrible that it will cause global chaos.&lt;P&gt;Two groups have been seeking the document since the Middle Ages.&lt;P&gt;One is the Pres, an ancient society so secret that most experts dont believe it actually exists. It has formed an unholy alliance with a shadowy group within the Vatican. They are bent on destroying the Grail before its contents can be revealed so that they can pursue a plan of earth-shaking consequences. Opposing them is a tiny group of obscure monks who like the Knights Templar before them are sworn to protect the Holy Grail. They have vowed to reveal its shocking secret to the world. The archeologist hides the document then flees to Key West and his old friend, retired museum director, Rene Barberri.  Before he can pass on the secret, his rented car explodes, killing him instantly and almost killing Barberri.&lt;P&gt;Rene and Key West beach-bum Homicide Detective, Dexter Piet, set out to track down their friends murderers and to find the Grail. By now the two religious groups are attacking each other with the demonic abandon of the possessed while they scour the earth to find the hidden document. &lt;P&gt;Rene and Dex are plunged into this seething web of murder and deceit in their breakneck pursuit of the murderers that careens from the steamy beaches of Key West, into the teeming souks of Tunis, to the back alleys of Paris and finally to a blood-soaked showdown in the remote Basque Pyrenees.&lt;/p&gt;" />
