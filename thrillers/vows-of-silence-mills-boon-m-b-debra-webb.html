  <title>Vows of Silence (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Debra Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Lacy, Cassidy, Kira and Melinda are friends bound by a deadly secret. One of them is a killer. At least that&#39;s what each one suspects. Ten years ago, Melinda&#39;s abusive husband, Charles Ashland, was murdered. The gun was Lacy&#39;s. But it didn&#39;t matter. Together, the women disposed of the body, which has never been found…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;until now. The powerful Ashland family, whose patriarch is poised for the vice presidency, wants justice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cassidy, an attorney, insists the women have nothing to fear. Then she is killed. A midnight caller is stalking the remaining friends, taunting them that he knows the truth. And the truth is something police chief Rick Summers is quite interested in learning from Lacy, despite the wild chemistry that&#39;s causing havoc with his judgment. Another death delivers a chilling new warning, for the price they&#39;ve paid for their vow of silence has been murder.&lt;/p&gt;
