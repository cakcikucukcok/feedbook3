  <title>The Sight of Blood - Michele Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A murder mystery. A love story. A social commentary. All these describe &lt;i&gt;The Sight of Blood.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in a small Michigan town in the 70s, the disappearance of a young woman and the murder of a beloved citizen seem to have no connection to the people and the officials of Grangeville, but to Jane Fleming, the towns firs woman deputy, there IS a connection. But hampered by few clues, and the hostility of the townspeople and the sheriffs department, including Sheriff Ralph Parsons, to a female deputy, Jane has to struggle to find the evidence of the connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But supporting her is her lover Michael Butch Przybylski, a cocky mechanic and owner of a filling station in Grangeville. Jane with her passionate and barely discreet affair with Butch further shocks the townspeople.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sight of blood is also filled with the characters and homespun lifestyle of small town America, examined during Janes investigation and relationship with Butch; Tim Usher, the towns newspaper publisher, who has his own feelings about Jane, George Robbins, who gets Jane out of a tight situation. These and other characters, plus the Michigan setting, make &lt;i&gt;The Sight of Blood&lt;/i&gt; a fun and entertaining read.&lt;/p&gt;" />
