As Tim wends his way deep undercover into an insidious operation called The Program, he confronts a brand of mind-warping manipulation beyond his worst expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tim becomes enmeshed with a diverse band of characters&amp;#8212;from the charismatic, messianic leader T. D. Betters to a cult reject burnout to the intelligent yet highly vulnerable Leah herself&amp;#8212;and finds himself caught in a shadowy landscape of lies, manipulation, and terror. At stake: innocent minds&amp;#8212;maybe even his own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
