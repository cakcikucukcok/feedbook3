  <title>Tidal Trap - Derek Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Tidal Trap&lt;/i&gt; finds hero Jefferson Parker quickly embroiled in an international chase of global proportions. When invited to visit his friend at a Naval base in Maine, Parker is recruited to undertake a covert mission. At first he refuses, but after an attack on the station and the disappearance of his friend, Parker accepts his role.  Parker and his schooner crew are drawn ever deeper into intrigue and betrayal. At stake, the security of America&#39;s submarine force and the lives of countless people. Behind the obvious conflict arises a secret past for both Parker and Taylor Stephenson, a beautiful but seemingly innocent bystander.  Not to be so easily pushed aside, there&#39;s Carla Gianni too, who is a crewmember on Parker&#39;s schooner. She too is very much in love with Parker and isn&#39;t about to her man just slip away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  Join Parker as he struggles to find solutions to a rogue submarine and environmental issues about dolphins used as weapons. Parker must come to terms with a mission betrayed, a crew to lead and protect, and a choice between two women he professes to love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;Tidal Trap&lt;/i&gt; will take you on a journey into attack submarines, across storm-swept oceans in a fast sailing ship, and behind doors with political trade-offs." />
