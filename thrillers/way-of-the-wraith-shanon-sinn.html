      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Death comes at the end of every road&lt;/i&gt;, he had always said, and now it came for him.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In a land devoid of memory, one man wakes from death only to discover that its nothing he could have ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Within a realm of fear and suffering, demons and angry spirits feed off of the recently deceased. Pain and attachment to the material world torture those that do not understand why they remain earthbound, or why some of them seem to be lucid at all.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Stalked by reapers, hated by the living, and betrayed by those he once loved, one man races against time to discover why he remains upon the earth and what it is that he is supposed to accomplish.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The end approaches. Not just for him, but for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
