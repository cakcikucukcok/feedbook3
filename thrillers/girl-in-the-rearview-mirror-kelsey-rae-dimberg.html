      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An &lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly &lt;/em&gt;hottest read of the summer &amp;#8226; A &lt;em&gt;USA Today &lt;/em&gt;hottest read of the week &amp;#8226; A &lt;em&gt;Refinery29 &lt;/em&gt;best thriller of June &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8226; A &lt;em&gt;New York Post &lt;/em&gt;best book of the week&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;With hairpin twists and immense psychological acuity, Kelsey Rae Dimberg&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Girl in the Rearview Mirror&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;is as seductive as the glamorous, privileged family at its center&amp;#8212;and as cunning. An exciting, intoxicating debut, it will hold you until its startling final pages.&amp;#8221;&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Megan Abbott, bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Dare Me &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Give Me Your Hand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I never meant to lie. That is, I never wanted to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;They are Phoenix&amp;#8217;s First Family: handsome Philip Martin, son of the sitting Senator, an ex-football player who carries himself with an easy grace and appears destined to step into his father&amp;#8217;s seat when the time is right; his wife Marina, the stylish and elegant director of Phoenix&amp;#8217;s fine arts museum; and their four-year-old daughter Amabel, beautiful and precocious and beloved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finn Hunt is working a dull office job to pay off her college debt when she meets Philip and charms Amabel. She eagerly agrees to nanny, thinking she&amp;#8217;s lucked into the job of a lifetime. Though the glamour of the Martins&amp;#8217; lifestyle undeniably dazzles Finn, her real pleasure comes from being part of the family: sharing quick jokes with Philip in the kitchen before he leaves for work; staying late when Marina needs a last-minute sitter; and spending long days with Amabel, who is often treated more like a photo op than a child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But behind every fa&amp;#231;ade lurks a less attractive truth. When a young woman approaches Finn, claiming a connection with Philip and asking Finn to pass on a message, Finn becomes caught up in a web of deceit with the senate seat at its center. And Finn isn&amp;#8217;t exactly innocent herself: she too has a background she has kept hidden, and under the hot Phoenix sun, everything is about to be laid bare. . . .&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
