  <title>The Silent Places - James Patrick Hunt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;St. Louis Police Lt. George Hastings is loyal to the people under his command. When they&#39;re right, he backs them all the way. Sometimes it gets him in trouble. So after a round of butting heads with the top brass, Hastings and his team catch a lousy detail--keeping an eye on Senator Alan Preston, a political star looking to storm the national stage in the upcoming presidential elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s only one problem with Preston&#39;s plans. It seems that John Reese, a veteran and former CIA agent whom Preston prosecuted while a U.S. Attorney, has escaped from prison and may be looking to settle the score. Preston won&#39;t reveal any details. All he&#39;ll say is that Reese is a traitor who should&#39;ve been executed a long time ago. But as Hastings guards the senator, he uncovers a much different story about Reese, one that isn&#39;t as cut-and-dried as Preston would like everyone to believe, one that would give a man like Reese plenty of reason to want revenge at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hastings races to stop Reese, he quickly finds that he&#39;s not the only one hunting this most dangerous prey and that Reese isn&#39;t the only one caught in the crosshairs of politicians and professional killers in &lt;i&gt;The Silent Places&lt;/i&gt;, another pulse-pounding read from James Patrick Hunt.&lt;/p&gt;" />
