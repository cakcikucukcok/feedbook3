          &lt;strong&gt;They say blood is thicker than water. They have no idea. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a blood tracker, Liv is extremely powerful. And in a world where power is a commodity that can get you killed, Liv has learnt to survive by her own rules. Rule number one? Trust no one. But when a friend s daughter goes missing, Liv is bound by a potent magical oath. She can&#39;t rest until the child is safe. And that means trusting her dangerous ex, Cam.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A sinister prophecy tells that she and Cam will be the death of each other, yet Liv s tired of being a slave to destiny. She s ready to play the forces controlling her world at their own game. No matter what the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
