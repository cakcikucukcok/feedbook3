  <title>2018: an Uncivil War - Phil Sanderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stuart Milligan and Terrance Crawley have been best friends since they were teenagers.  But they drifted apart when Stuart went to college and Terrance joined the Marines.  Stuart eventually obtained his degree in Business Management from the University of Memphis while Stuart served as a military policeman in Iraq.  After Stuart decided to follow Terrance into the Marine Corps, though as an officer, the two of them ended up drifting apart.  They unfortunately went in two separate directions as life seemingly pulled them apart.
Now the two men are living totally separate lives but are about to reignite their friendship amidst a very volatile backdrop.  Political and controversial events will surely strain their newly rekindled friendship at the very seams, which barely hold it all back together.  When the American government decides to repeal the 2nd Amendment after various terrorist atrocities are committed on the very lands of the great country it governs, many Americans do not stand for it.  And it does not take long before the lines are drawn on American soil, and many good Americans will end up bleeding upon it while fighting for their various beliefs.  
2018: An Uncivil War looks at the controversial sides of gun control versus gun rights.  The author tries to offer convincing sides to both arguments allowing the readers to decide where they stand in the whole debate.  Fictional events within the novel possess the potential to change one person&#39;s side to the other in the most surprisingly revealing way possible through scenes that will not only leave you speechless, but also so intrigued that you cannot wait to read the next chapters as you read onward toward the shocking conclusion!
If you like Ian Fleming and Tom Clancy, you are sure to like Phil Sanderson&#39;s humble, yet bold style of storytelling as he crafts a story that will engage your full array of emotions as well as your strong sense of honor." />
