          &lt;strong&gt;SECOND CHANCE…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dr. Luke Jarrod remembered Madelyn Foster as a seventeen-year-old beauty with whom he&#39;d shared one night of stolen passion. Nine months too late, he returned to discover she&#39;d had his child but had been forced to give their daughter away. Now, after twenty years, Madelyn was back in his life, pregnant again, and needing his help desperately. Luke knew this was his chance to make good on the one truly wonderful thing that had ever happened to him. This amazing woman deserved a knight in shining armor. Could the wary Luke be both a father to her baby–and a man worthy of her precious love?&lt;/p&gt;
