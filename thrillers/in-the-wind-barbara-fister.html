  <title>In the Wind - Barbara Fister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anni Koskinen is out of a job. After ten years in the Chicago Police Department, her moral compass led her across the thin blue line to testify against a fellow cop - and, in the aftermath, she lost the only career she ever wanted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she is putting a new life together, a gentle church worker appears on her doorstep and asks for a ride out of town. It&#39;s not until the FBI gets involved that Anni realizes she has helped a fugitive escape. And not just any fugitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hard to grasp that Rosa Saenz, a popular figure in her largely Latino parish, was once involved with a radical faction of the American Indian Movement. It&#39;s even harder to believe that Rosa was responsible for the murder of an FBI agent in 1972. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even a close friend in the Bureau urges Anni to work with Rosa&#39;s defense team to find out what happened all those years ago. Because it soon becomes clear that it&#39;s more important to the authorities to find Rosa guilty than to find the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught in the vortex of a no-holds-barred federal investigation, angry cops who believe she&#39;s once again working for the wrong side, and a dangerous group of white supremacists bent on establishing their own version of history, Anni&#39;s investigation into crimes of the past throws her in the path of a clear and present danger. And this time, she stands to lose much more than her job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on parallels between counterintelligence practices of the Vietnam War era and today&#39;s hostile climate for civil liberties, &lt;i&gt;In the Wind&lt;/i&gt; gathers gale-force strength as the events  of the past collide with the present - and, for Anni, the political becomes all too personal.&lt;/p&gt;" />
