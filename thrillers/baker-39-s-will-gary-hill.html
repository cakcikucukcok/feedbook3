  <title>Baker&#39;s Will - Gary Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Baker&#39;s Will is a hard charging tale of love, greed and death. It was conceived in the minds of two, old men; one black, one white,one a former slave, the other a former slave owner; each steeped in his own past, each unwilling to accept the possibilities of the future; each stubborn as mules. One hundred years later,death would take center stage among the living and hell would be waiting in the wings.      Michael Evans is a former Heavyweight boxing champion turned detective for the New York City police department who finds himself embedded in a web of violence and death. His family is savagely murdered and he almost lost his own life to the wrath of a hundred year old will.      Laura Sanders is a lawyer fresh out of law school. She had always been unlucky at love until she met Michael Evans. Together they would experience a world gone mad and death would land on their doorstep. True love has it&#39;s own rewards and out of their collective despair would come a new beginning with new hopes and new dreams.      Elizabeth Baker is the Matriarch of the Baker Clan. Her hatred for Michael Evans and the threat of change would prove to be her life&#39;s greatest challenge. The legacy of the past and the realities of the future would prove to be too much for her and in the end, she lost it all.      Baker&#39;s Will was conceived in rural Georgia in the early nineteen hundreds and moves to New York City one hundred years later. There is no shortage of action or excitement." />
