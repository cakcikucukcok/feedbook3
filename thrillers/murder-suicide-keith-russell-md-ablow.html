  <title>Murder Suicide - Keith Russell Md Ablow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The only forensic psychiatrist writing suspense, Keith Ablow is being hailed as the heir to Thomas Harris.    &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Ablow&#39;s novels delve deep into that dark and deadly place that Ablow, one of the nation&#39;s leading forensic psychiatrists, knows best: the psyche of a killer.  Ablow has explored the catacombs of the criminal mind to find out what makes them tick, and he brings that expertise to his new novel, a chilling and emotionally compelling story of the lengths to which one man will go to leave his own life behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Murder Suicide&lt;/i&gt;, Ablow and his alter-ego, Dr. Frank Clevenger, return to take on a murder case like no other.  John Snow is a brilliant inventor who has made millions from his genius in aeronautics.  He has everything a man could desire:  wealth, family, even a beautiful mistress.  But he also has a brain disease, a rare form of epilepsy, that threatens his most valuable possession -- his mind.  Only one doctor may be able to cure it surgically, but at a terrible cost, one that Snow reveals to no one:  Snow will have no memory whatsoever of his past - of its emotional entanglements or its secrets.  He will be abandoning everyone he has ever known.  But the night before he is scheduled to undergo the operation, he is found near the Massachusetts General Hospital, dead of a gunshot wound.  Did he commit suicide, as the police suspect - or was he murdered?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Frank Clevenger delves into Snow&#39;s complex past and tortured relationships to unlock the identity of Snow&#39;s killer:  Was it the wife who can never forgive what he&#39;s done to their child and their marriage, the son who loathes him, the beautiful mistress who loves him so deeply but can never have him, or the business partner intent on taking control of his inventions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only Frank Clevenger can unlock the door to Snow&#39;s startling past.  And only Keith Ablow can take readers even further into the mind of a killer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
