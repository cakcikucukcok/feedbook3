  <title>Death&#39;s Door (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Meryl Sawyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Madison Connelly is tired of lies–and betrayal. First her husband and business partner leaves her for another woman. Then Detective Paul Tanner arrives to tell her that the man she thought was her father isn&#39;t. Madison wants answers…answers about her past that someone is going to deadly lengths to keep hidden.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Falling for Madison isn&#39;t in Paul&#39;s job description: find the girl, bring her to his employer, Wyatt Holbrook, the end. But as Madison bravely agrees to cross over a dangerous threshold into Holbrook&#39;s privileged, secretive world, she&#39;ll need more than Paul&#39;s growing attraction to keep her safe. Because she&#39;s about to be drawn deep into a complicated web of intrigue, deceit–and murder.&lt;/p&gt;
