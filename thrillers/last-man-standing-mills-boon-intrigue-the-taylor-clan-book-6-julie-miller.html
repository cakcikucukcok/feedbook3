  <title>Last Man Standing (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Taylor Clan, Book 6) - Julie Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Undercover cop Cole Taylor had his hands full sustaining a secret identity as he worked to expose a Kansas City crime boss–while living under the enemy&#39;s roof! The last thing he needed was a snooty intellectual type interfering in his investigation, asking suspicious questions and snooping where she shouldn&#39;t.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Besides, with all that fiery red hair and miles of silky skin, Victoria Westin didn&#39;t look like any professor he knew….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She had the touch-me-not beauty of an aristocrat and fit right in with their upper-crust hosts. But the streetwise Taylor from working-class roots would have to persuade Miss High-and-Mighty to cooperate with his plan to save his life–and now hers, too. And if he couldn&#39;t gain her cooperation by his usual methods, he&#39;d blackmail her with bedroom fantasies to &quot;maintain cover.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
