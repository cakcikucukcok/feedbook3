  <title>A SUMMER AGAIN - George A Rothery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the first of three Mr. Halston &amp;nbsp;mystery thriller novels that Rothery plans to write and publish. It takes place in the year 1969 in a small island resort community on the New Jersey coast. Cable news, the internet, computers, and cell phones were not everywhere then so it was soon forgotten. The story begins with the sale of Mr. Halston&amp;rsquo;s company in Atlanta after becoming a widower three years prior to the story. He knows that he needs something new in his life and the sale makes him a very wealthy man. He decides to visit the New Jersey coastal town where he spent every summer of his life until he was twenty three years old, but has not been back since. He stops on the way to visit his old Korean War pal, Danny. When that war was over Mr. Halston stayed some years in the U S Air Force before starting his company, but Danny went straight to the CIA. Over the ensuing years, Danny has entangled Mr. Halston in a number of questionable &amp;ldquo;favors&amp;rdquo; for the CIA, and it seems he is at it again. This time there is an international connection to the favor making it more complicated for Mr. Halston. There is suspense, romance, and &amp;ldquo;rock solid action scenes&amp;rdquo; ( Kirkus Review ) and a &amp;ldquo;robust, fast-paced, and to put hard down&amp;rdquo; story. ( Midwest Book Reviews ).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
