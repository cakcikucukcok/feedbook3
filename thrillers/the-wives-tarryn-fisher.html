        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Imagine that your husband has two other wives.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You’ve never met the other wives. None of you know each other, and because of this unconventional arrangement, you can see your husband only one day a week. But you love him so much you don’t care. Or at least that’s what you’ve told yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But one day, while you’re doing laundry, you find a scrap of paper in his pocket—an appointment reminder for a woman named Hannah, and you just know it’s another of the wives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You thought you were fine with your arrangement, but you can’t help yourself: you track her down, and, under false pretences, you strike up a friendship. Hannah has no idea who you really are. Then, Hannah starts showing up to your coffee dates with telltale bruises, and you realise she’s being abused by her husband. Who, of course, is also your husband. But you’ve never known him to be violent, ever.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Who exactly is your husband, and how far would you go to find the truth? Would you risk your own life?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And who is his mysterious third wife?&lt;/p&gt;
