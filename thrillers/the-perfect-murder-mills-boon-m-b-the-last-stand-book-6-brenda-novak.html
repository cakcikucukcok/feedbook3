  <title>The Perfect Murder (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (The Last Stand, Book 6) - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;For more than a year, Sebastian Costas has been trying to unravel the truth behind the murder of his ex-wife and son. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, he&#39;s convinced that her second husband–a cop–committed both murders, then faked his own death. Now Sebastian has followed the slimmest of leads to Sacramento…and that&#39;s where he finally gets the break he needs. Jane Burke, an investigator with The Last Stand, calls him in connection with a separate crime–a crime that could lead him straight to the man he&#39;s been looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Once married to a serial killer, Jane has spent the past five years rebuilding her life. And with Sebastian she finally has a chance at happiness. But the man they&#39;re after is after them, too. For him this has become a personal battle, one he&#39;s determined to win. Whatever it takes…&lt;/p&gt;
