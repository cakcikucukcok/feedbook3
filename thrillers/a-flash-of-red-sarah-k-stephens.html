  <title>A Flash of Red - Sarah K. Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Flash of Red - A Psychological Thriller&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
What happens when you can&amp;rsquo;t tell the difference between desire, obsession, and reality? Thanks to her husband, Anna is about to find out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Psychology professor Anna Kline and her architect husband, Sean, are a young couple in a fractured marriage, each struggling with their own misperceptions of reality. Sean seeks solace from his perfect wife in the cold intimacy of love and sex offered online, while Anna copes by offering her own oppressive version of devotion. Becoming an ever more tangible presence in their weakening marriage is the question of Anna&amp;rsquo;s mental state and whether she will follow the same path as her now institutionalized mother.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
When Bard, a student of Anna&amp;rsquo;s with a family history of schizophrenia, discovers Sean&amp;rsquo;s addiction, Bard&amp;rsquo;s admiration for Anna morphs into a delusion of special intimacy. Guilt-ridden with his own past failure to protect his older sister, Bard&amp;rsquo;s skewed mind begins to see Anna as another woman in need of rescue.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
As Sean and Anna&amp;rsquo;s marriage becomes a battleground of manipulation, Bard privately crafts a strategy to save Anna from her husband, sending their three worlds spinning out of control with irrevocable and deadly consequences. A Flash of Red&amp;#39;s driving plot and multi-faceted characters detail the destruction that ensues when mental illness attacks our most intimate relationships.&lt;/p&gt;" />
