  <title>Texas Hero (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Merline Lovelace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Talk about reinventing himself! Once Jack Carstairs had nearly been drummed out of the Omega Agency–all for falling for the beautiful and powerful woman he&#39;d been assigned to protect. Now the crackerjack agent was back, protecting that same woman–and getting ready to move in for the kill. Or to &lt;em&gt;prevent&lt;/em&gt; the kill, as the case might be.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And it was. For Jack&#39;s current assignment was to protect lovely Ellie Alazar–historian extraordinaire, whose doubts about the heroes of the Alamo were evidently not sitting well with whoever was taking potshots at her. Once Ellie had been Jack&#39;s whole world. Now she was targeted for rewriting the past, and Jack couldn&#39;t help but wonder: Could she also rewrite &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; past–only this time, with a happy ending?&lt;/p&gt;
