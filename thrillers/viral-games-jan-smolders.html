  <title>Viral Games - Jan Smolders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anita Tavares just arrived at the Santo Domingo airport in the Dominican Republic, and she is there on crucial business. Tavares is the powerful and highly visible face of a worldwide HIV/AIDS donor foundation. Shes in charge of funding in an effort to fight the disease, and shell stop at nothing to get what she wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somebody has other plans for Tavares, however. Just after landing at the airport, she is shot and killed. Her attacker not only commits murder; he also escapes with two bags belonging to his victim. Officials are left with many questions: Who murdered this powerful woman? Was the crime really about her, or was it about the contents of her luggage?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So begins a whirlwind adventure into the depths of Caribbean politics and crooked pharmaceutical sales. Men of power now battle the powerless for information that only a dead woman knew. Greed and corruption rule the streets as the AIDS epidemic continues to spread, and criminals take control of secrets once held by Tavares. But is there a way to stop those who would do harm in a place where no rule is sacred?&lt;/p&gt;" />
