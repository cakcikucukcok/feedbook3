  <title>Imminent Danger (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Carla Cassidy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;HER REAL NAME WAS ALLISON WELCH…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But he knew her as Cecilia Webster. Just weeks ago, she&#39;d had everything. Then came the tragedy that stole it all–along with her eyesight. The blindness was only temporary. So were her new name and her stay in rural Montana. But what about her feelings for the gruff, tender lawman who&#39;d taken her in?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tormented by his own past, Sheriff Jesse Wilder had a beautiful, vulnerable witness in his protective custody–and more on his mind than keeping her safe. But his charge&#39;s life depended on his guarding her secret–&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; resisting his own forbidden urges….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Mustang Montana&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A lively little town filled with secrets, scandal, gossip–and unexpected romance at every turn (of the page)!&lt;/strong&gt;
