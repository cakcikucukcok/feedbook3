  <title>Dangerous Memories (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Barbara Colley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Clinging to the thought of the child growing inside her, Leah Davis slowly rebuilt her life after her husband Hunter&#39;s death–until the day he showed up on her doorstep, alone, confused and very much alive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But instead of flinging herself into his arms and weeping tears of joy, she found herself on the run with a husband who didn&#39;t remember their marriage…or why people were shooting at him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Leah vowed to protect their baby at any cost, even if it meant withholding the truth about her pregnancy from the one man who had a right to know. But she wouldn&#39;t turn her back on the dangerously handsome man who&#39;d revived her buried passion. They had to uncover the secrets surrounding Hunter&#39;s &quot;murder&quot; before the killer could strike again. But if Hunter&#39;s memory returned, could he forgive Leah for &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt; secrets?&lt;/p&gt;
