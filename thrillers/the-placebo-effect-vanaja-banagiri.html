  <title>The Placebo Effect - Vanaja Banagiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Why do some people choose the untrodden path? Whats with the ones who choose to live on their own terms? What goes on in the minds and lives of non conformists? These are some questions The Placebo Effect attempts to address through various characters. Their existential dilemmas, their struggles with life, their own versions of truth - form the crux of the story that is characterised by a lingering staccato. When their lives intertwine, the consequence is an unpredictable roller coaster.
Feisty Menakas surreal misadventures and haunting nightmares compel her to lead a chaotic life. In search of herself, she embarks on a journey of self discovery that reveals shocking truths about her persona. 
Vaidehi begins her life by toeing the line drawn by her family and society until she begins to feel claustrophobic. Her life seems perfect from the outside but within the facade is the age- old patriarchal formula of an Indian family. 
Prabhat is caring, sensitive and a sensible man whose understanding of life is very different from most Indian men. The reason could be his sexual orientation which is also different from most men.
Yadagiri is much more refined than most educated men even though he is illiterate and a gardener by vocation. His sensitivity and respect for women are way ahead of the highly educated men.
Rishi is a passive bystander who lets life happen to him. Very rarely does he take action to change his circumstances or rectify his mistakes until life throws one of it curves.
Dev is the quintessential Indian man who `allows his wife to do what she wants. He believes aggression is the only route to command respect but what he gets in return is DEATH." />
