  <title>Somebody&#39;s Sinning In My Bed - Pat G&#39;Orge-Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A wickedly funny, uplifting novel of love and betrayal.  .  .good karma and bad karma.  .  .sin and redemption.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chyna and her sister, Janelle, are always moments away from a catfight. They love each other, but Janelle has never forgiven her sister for swiping her first love, Cordell. That was ages ago, and now Chyna is showing off as the First Lady of New Hope Assembly, a church caught between the old ways of Holiness and new ways of serving its community. New Hope&#39;s leader, Reverend Grayson Young, is also caught--in the infamous Sweet Bush lounge, an establishment well-known for adult pleasures.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the church congregation running wild in the aftermath of her husband&#39;s scandalous behavior, Chyna turns to Janelle for guidance. But if Chyna thinks she&#39;s getting sympathy, she&#39;d better think again, because Janelle&#39;s got her own crisis. And when Cordell suddenly reappears in their lives, what follows are squabbling, chaos, and surprises that show just how hard the road to salvation really is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Filled with characters that jump off the page. . . . Pat G&#39;Orge-Walker has a way of showing us our flaws in a humorous manner.&quot; --Shelia M. Goss, author of &lt;i&gt;Delilah&lt;/i&gt;" />
