  <title>Revelations - Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the End of Days. A nuclear strike hits New York. Alfie, a young black male, survives, but with no memory of what has happened. The only thing he can remember with any clarity is how to play his guitar and a few snatches of old blues and folk songs. Another survivor, Meg, has taken refuge in the hills of Vermont. She too is the victim of near absolute amnesia. The few things she can recall are her only hope at survival in these darkest of days. Across the country, a prophet called John is reveling in the fallout of chaos that accompanies the strike, and is calling for Judgement Day against sinners while all around him civilization burns. This is the final battle. Alfie and Meg don&#39;t know it, but they have a grim destiny. They must stand together and defeat the Great Beast with only their faith to shield them. Can they build a New Jerusalem from the ruins of the White House?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Solomon&lt;/B&gt; has spent most of his adult life as fighting injustice wherever he has seen it. He spent several years in developing nations helping those who couldn&#39;t help themselves: some of the projects he worked on included bringing fresh water to areas without it, providing sex and health education, and securing vital aid in war-torn regions. He has served on peace-keeping forces, campaigned against the deployment of landmines, and, in the last decade, devoted his life to ecological issues, most notably combating the illegal trade in endangered species. He has witnessed atrocities no man should ever see and glimpsed the secret inner workings of the world of the rich and powerful, making him an enemy of some of the most dangerous men on the planet. Never once has he walked away from a fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
