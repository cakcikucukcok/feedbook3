  <title>The Book of Caleb - J. W. Delorie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Caleb knew he would follow the teachings and the love of the Lord soon after he gave John the basket full of bread and fish. Later he came to realize that this man named John was very close to the Messiah, the One they called Jesus. Like his father, Caleb was a simple fisherman, having the skills taught to him as he worked on the Sea of Galilee. However, his father taught him more than fishing during the times in the boat. He could hear the Love of the Lord from his father as he spoke to him about the Fathers Word, and the ways of the Son. After the accident on the Sea of Galilee that took his father home to the Lord, Caleb at the age of seventeen started dreaming of the Messiah. He would wake to his mother and younger brother watching over him waiting to hear more of his dreams. As he explained how Jesus offered him the Crown of Thorns he realized he was being given a great journey, and he could feel through the love of the Father that he would receive help during this journey that would take him far from his home of Bethsaida in search of the Crown." />
