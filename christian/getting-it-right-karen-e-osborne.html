  <title>Getting It Right - Karen E. Osborne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Getting It Right&lt;/I&gt; is the story of Kara and Alex, half-sisters who have never met, one the product of an abusive foster-care setting, the other of dysfunctional privilege. The novel is set in Harlem, the Bronx, and the wealthy community of Bedford, New York, during two weeks in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haunted by crippling memories, Kara falls for the wrong men, tries to help her foster-care siblings suffering from PTSD, and longs for the father and half-sister she only knows from a photograph. Alex, meanwhile, struggles to keep her younger sisters out of trouble, her mother sane, and her marketing business afloat. Now she has a new responsibility: from his hospital bed, her father tasks Alex with finding Kara, the mixed-race child he abandoned. Alex is stunned to learn of Kara&#39;s existence but reluctantly agrees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To make things more complicated, Kara loves a married man whom the FBI is pursuing for insider trading. When Alex eventually finds her half-sister, she becomes embroiled in Kara&#39;s dangers, which threaten to drag them both down. If Kara doesn&#39;t help the FBI, she could face prosecution and possible incarceration, and if Alex can&#39;t persuade Kara to meet their father, she will let him down during the final days of his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This novel explores grit and resilience, evolving definitions of race and family, and the ultimate power of redemption and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
