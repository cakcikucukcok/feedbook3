  <title>North of Springville - Justin Rowland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The planet had been utterly transformed. Casualties from natural and man made calamities were of a biblical proportion. There were no longer any nations. There were no longer any laws of men. The world had become a wild place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, two generations later, the descendants of those that survived continue to carry on. Among them is Jedidiah. A man of steadfast faith, he enjoys a communion with his God that few come to know. One who prefers the solitude of the wilderness, he strives to live in peace with others. But when those that he loves are confronted with the horrors of human trafficking, he is forced to employ the skills of war that have been honed by the realities of an unforgiving world. His faith grows and his tactics shine as he endeavors to do what he knows to be right. Their reign of terror must be stopped. And Jedidiah would give his life to stop it." />
