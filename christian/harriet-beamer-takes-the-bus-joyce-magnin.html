  <title>Harriet Beamer Takes the Bus - Joyce Magnin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Aging and recent widow Harriet Beamer insists she&amp;rsquo;s getting along fine with her dog Humphrey in Philadelphia &amp;hellip; until she falls for the fourth time, injuring her ankle, and causing her son and daughter-in-law to cry foul. Insisting Harriet move in with them in California, they make a bet that her ankle is broken, and she foolishly promises to move if they&amp;rsquo;re right. Four x-rays later, Harriet&amp;rsquo;s ankle&amp;mdash;and her heart&amp;mdash;are broken. She packs up, ships her huge salt and pepper collection to California, and prepares to move away from the only life she knows. The only catch? She&amp;rsquo;s doing it her way. Just wait till her daughter-in-law hears Harriet will travel cross country only by public transportation and alternate means. What follows is a hilarious, heartwarming journey by train, metro bus, ferry, and motorcycle. Along the way, Harriet discovers that although her family thinks it&amp;rsquo;s time for her to be put out to pasture&amp;mdash;God has a different plan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
