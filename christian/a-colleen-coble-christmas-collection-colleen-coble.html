  <title>A Colleen Coble Christmas Collection - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Silent Night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As Christmas day nears, Bree and her faithful search-and-rescue dog Samson follow the trail of a&amp;nbsp;troubling mystery&amp;nbsp;into the snowy forests of Rock Harbor.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bree Matthews is preparing for Christmas guests, but her heart is reeling from&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;recent and tender loss&amp;nbsp;of her unborn child. Her sister-in-law, Lauri, suddenly turns up on the doorstep of the lighthouse home&amp;nbsp;Bree shares with her husband, Kade, in Rock Harbor. Secretive and withdrawn, Lauri seems curiously intent on discovering what happened to a parachuter who disappeared in the North Woods along&amp;nbsp;Lake&amp;nbsp;Superior&#39;s icy shore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Holy Night&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One sinister phone call has derailed their wedding.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will they let it tear them apart forever?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Christmas wedding on the beach&amp;mdash;what could be more perfect? Poinsettias and fragrant pikake blossoms, soft sand and mistletoe, the gentle sound of the surf and the wedding march played on a ukulele. This wedding has been a long time coming, with Bane&#39;s trust issues and Leia&#39;s worries about her childlike sister, Eva. Now they can hardly wait for the day to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Is Calm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brendan Waddell needs a place to recuperate. Lauren Everman needs a place to hide. It&amp;rsquo;s going to be an unexpectedly romantic Christmas at Bluebird Ranch.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brendan Waddell has always considered Bluebird Ranch a little piece of heaven: an idyllic ranch that pairs abused children with abused horses, run by one of his old Marine buddies. Now, recovering from an on-the-job injury, Brendan thinks the ranch is the perfect place to spend Christmas healing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Lauren Everman was a seventeen-year-old foster kid, Bluebird Ranch was the safest place she knew. Now it&amp;rsquo;s the perfect hideout for a woman on the run. As the witness to a murder, Lauren needs somewhere to lie low, and her skill with horses means she&amp;rsquo;ll be able to lend a hand with the troubled kids at Bluebird&amp;mdash;without answering too many questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;All Is Bright&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A romantic, Christmas wedding at her seaside hotel gives Delilah a chance to shine with her unique gifts. But will her light be snuffed out before the bride and groom say &amp;ldquo;I do&amp;rdquo;?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As manager of the Tidewater Inn, Delilah Carter has been planning a spectacular Christmas wedding for her friends at the grand hotel overlooking the ocean. While picking up still more twinkly lights and some last-minute groceries for the reception dinner, a huge truck runs her off the freezing, wet roads into the dark night. Her car stops just short of an enormous tree and the truck speeds off into the night. Delilah escapes with her life and has almost convinced herself the whole thing was an accident, but then she begins to receive threatening phone calls. With the wedding just hours away, she&amp;rsquo;s distracted and anxious. Then Sheriff Tom Bourne stops by the inn and volunteers to help.&lt;/p&gt;" />
