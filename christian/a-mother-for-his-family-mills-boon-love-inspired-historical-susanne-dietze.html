  <title>A Mother For His Family (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired Historical) - Susanne Dietze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A Convenient Arrangement&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lady Helena Stanhope&#39;s reputation is in tatters…and she’s lost any hope for a “respectable” ton marriage. An arranged union is the only solution. But once Helena weds formidable Scottish widower John Gordon, Lord Ardoch, and encounters his four mischievous children, she&#39;s determined to help her new, ever-surprising family. Even if she&#39;s sure love is too much to ask for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All John needs is someone to mother his admittedly-unruly brood. He never imagined that beautiful Lady Helena would be a woman of irresistible spirit, caring and warmth. Or that facing down their pasts would give them so much in common. Now as danger threatens, John will do whatever it takes to convince Helena their future together—and his love—are for always.&lt;/p&gt;
