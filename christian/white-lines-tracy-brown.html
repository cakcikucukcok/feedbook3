She partied hard, and life seemed good when she was with Born, the neighborhood kingpin whose name was synonymous with money, power, and respect. But all his love couldn&#39;t save her from a crack addiction. Jada goes from crack addict and prostitute to survivor and back again before she finds the strength to live for herself and come out on top. And her stormy romance with one of the fiercest hustlers on the streets makes &lt;i&gt;White Lines &lt;/i&gt;one of the most unforgettable urban loves stories of the year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
