  <title>Discrimination Experienced in the Nursing Profession by Minority Nurses - Melvina Semper Dnp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even in todays diverse world, discrimination unfortunately still occurs on the street, in schools, and in the workplace. In her compilation of fifty true stories, Dr. Melvina Semper provides a disheartening look into the experiences of twenty-first-century minority student nurses and practicing nurses working in New York City hospitals.
Dr. Semper, who holds three nursing degrees, interviewed fifty nurses whose personal stories reveal the ill treatment and lack of promotion, diversity, moral support, and other barriers students and nurses must face on the job. From the Hispanic nurse whose patient requested that only a white nurse care for her, to the Russian nurse who was only allowed to work night shifts, to the minority nurse who witnessed an accidental patient death and then was told not to talk about it by her white managers, Dr. Semper not only shares real-life stories but also highlights the need for stricter laws, enforcement of affirmative action, and the regulation of health care facilities to eradicate racisms at all levels.
Discrimination Experienced in the Nursing Profession by Minority Nurses offers eye-opening stories that will create awareness of the obstacles, racism, and discrimination that minority student nurses and practicing nurses face while working in New York City hospitals." />
