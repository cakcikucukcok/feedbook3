  <title>With Winter&#39;s First Frost - Kelly Irvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With the coldest season comes the warmest of second chances.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At age seventy-three, Laura Kauffman knows she is closer to the end of life than the beginning. If God willed it, she would join her beloved late husband soon. Even so, Laura wonders what purpose God might have for her in this winter of her life&amp;mdash;and why this season seems so lonely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Widower Zechariah Stutzman is facing his own barren season, despite the great-grandchildren swirling around him. With his Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s worsening, he had no choice but to move in with his grandson&amp;rsquo;s family, though now he feels adrift and useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Laura offers to help with Zechariah&amp;rsquo;s five great-grandchildren after their mother has a difficult childbirth, Zechariah is unsure how he will adjust to the warm but tart demeanor of this woman he has known since grade school. But soon Laura and Zechariah learn they are asking God the same questions about loss and hope. And they begin to wonder if He is providing answers after all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With Winter&amp;rsquo;s First Frost&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reminds us that God&amp;rsquo;s purposes always bear fruit&amp;mdash;and sometimes love is sweeter with age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
