  <title>David - Gerrie Uys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I asked the Lord what men/woman seek and lack in their lives today. The Lord answered and said, Their identity in Christ. I asked the Lord to show me a man and reveal the identity of such man in Christ. The Lord answered and said, I will show you the identity of a man after my own heart. 
What did I know about David? I knew that he was a shepherd boy who slew a giant. I mean, who would not be fascinated by a story of a boy that slays giants? As I progressed through the journey of studying the Bible about the life of David, I continuously wondered why David was called a man after Gods own heart. Why did God not refer to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, or Moses as men after his own heart? The story of David portrays a life of an ordinary shepherd boy that became the king of Israel. His life, however, was ridden with sin, and yet God called him a man after his own heart. 
It was only later that the Spirit revealed to me that it was because of Davids fierce intimate desire to have a relationship with the living God that he was characterized as a man after his own heart (Acts 13: 22).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God revealed the character of David through this story that runs parallel with the personal relationship that Jesus longs for with each one of usa relationship that cannot be tainted by our sins because of the blood of Jesus Christ. You are all called for a time like this to be a man/woman after Gods own heart just as he had ordained it so that you can have fellowship and an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ. You are the only one that can find your true identity through your relationship with Christ! A shepherd boy became king! What are you waiting for? The blood of Jesus works everlasting into the past, future, and present. May the story of David inspire you to a greater understanding of the heart of God the father through his son, Jesus Christ. You have been set free! You are a man/ woman after Gods own heart because of Jesus. John 8 verse 36 states, When the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
