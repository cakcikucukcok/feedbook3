  <title>Stones for Bread - Christa Parrish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A solitary artisan. A legacy of bread-baking. And one secret that could collapse her entire identity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liesl McNamara&amp;rsquo;s life can be described in one word: bread. From her earliest memory, her mother and grandmother passed down the mystery of baking and the importance of this deceptively simple food. And now, as the owner of Wild Rise bake house, Liesl spends every day up to her elbows in dough, nourishing and perfecting her craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the simple life she has cultivated is becoming quite complicated. Her head baker brings his troubled grandson into the bakeshop as an apprentice. Her waitress submits Liesl&amp;rsquo;s recipes to a popular cable cooking show. And the man who delivers her flour&amp;mdash;a single father with strange culinary habits&amp;mdash;seems determined to win Liesl&amp;rsquo;s affection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Wild Rise is featured on television, her quiet existence appears a thing of the past. And then a phone call from a woman claiming to be her half-sister forces Liesl to confront long-hidden secrets in her family&amp;rsquo;s past. With her precious heritage crumbling around her, the baker must make a choice: allow herself to be buried in detachment and remorse, or take a leap of faith into a new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with both spiritual and literal nourishment, &lt;em&gt;Stones for Bread &lt;/em&gt;provides a feast for the senses from award-winning author Christa Parrish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A quietly beautiful tale about learning how to accept the past and how to let go of the parts that tie you down.&quot; &amp;mdash;RT Book Reviews, 4.5 stars, TOP PICK!&lt;/p&gt;" />
