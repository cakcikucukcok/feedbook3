  <title>Every Perfect Gift - Dorothy Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ethan and Sophie long to share a future together. But the secrets they’re not sharing could tear them apart.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Sophie Caldwell has returned to Hickory Ridge, Tennessee, after years away. Despite the heartaches of her childhood, Sophie is determined to make a home, and a name, for herself in the growing town. A gifted writer, she plans to resurrect the local newspaper that so enchanted her as a girl.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ethan Heyward’s idyllic childhood was shattered by a tragedy he has spent years trying to forget. An accomplished businessman and architect, he has built a majestic resort in the mountains above Hickory Ridge, drawing wealthy tourists from all over the country.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When Sophie interviews Ethan for the paper, he is impressed with her intelligence and astounded by her beauty. She’s equally intrigued but fears he will reject her if he learns about her shadowed past. Just as she summons the courage to tell him, Ethan’s own past unexpectedly and violently catches up with him, threatening not only his life but their budding romance.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“Pure Southern delight! Dorothy Love weaves a stirring romance . . . that uplifts and inspires the heart.” —Tamera Alexander, best-selling author of &lt;I&gt;The Inheritance&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;A Lasting Impression&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
