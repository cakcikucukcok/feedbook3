  <title>Safe in His Arms - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sometimes it takes a stranger to see you as you really are.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Born and raised on sprawling Texas land, Margaret O’Brien prides herself on her competence as a rancher. But her father believes she’s made for more than just dawn-to-dusk work. He wants her to have the love of a good man, to raise children, to build a life. But Margaret gave up such dreams years ago. She’s convinced no man would have her, that the ranch is her life now.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;So when Margaret’s father hires Daniel Cutler as a new foreman, she’s frustrated and suspicious. Then an overheard conversation links him with a gang of bank robbers, and she’s downright worried. Daniel swears he’s not involved, but Margaret’s not convinced. She knows the man still has secrets. But would a criminal be so kind and talk so convincingly of his faith? As a series of tragic “accidents” threatens all she holds dear, Margaret must decide what to trust: her own ears, her best judgment . . . or what her heart keeps telling her.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;From the author of the best-selling &lt;I&gt;Blue Moon Promise &lt;/I&gt;. . . an exciting tale of danger, romance, and faith played out under Texas stars.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“Romantically tense, but with just the right touch of danger, this cowboy love story is surprisingly clever—and pleasingly sweet.” —USAToday.com for &lt;I&gt;Blue Moon Promise&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
