  <title>For You I Will (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) (Sag Harbor Village, Book 4) - Donna Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Mellow sun-kissed days turn into sultry nights made for mutual pleasure…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After ten years of service as chief of the E.R. at a New York City hospital, Dr. Kai Randall decided to trade her scrubs for a calmer existence in Sag Harbor Village. The only thing that has interrupted her serenity in months is the photo she snapped of a handsome, solitary stranger. The image haunts her. But that&#39;s nothing compared to how she feels when she comes face-to-face with the man from her dreams. When Assistant District Attorney Anthony Weston barges into Kai&#39;s house frantically looking for his young daughter, he meets one beautiful complication. Anthony&#39;s career ambitions caused him to lose his marriage-and now he&#39;s on the cusp of a huge promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His life is in the city that Kai left behind, but his heart is in the soul-stirring passion they share. Is this just another sizzling summer fling or could this be the beginning of forever?&lt;/p&gt;
