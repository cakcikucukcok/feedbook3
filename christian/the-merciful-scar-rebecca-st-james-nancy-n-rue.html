  <title>The Merciful Scar - Rebecca St. James, Nancy N. Rue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kirsten has spent her life trying to forget. But mercy begs her to remember.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she was in high school, a terrible accident fractured her family, and the only relief Kirsten could find was carving tiny lines into her skin, burying her pain in her flesh. The pain she caused herself was neat and manageable compared to the emotional pain that raged inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was coping. Or so she thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, eight years later, on the night she expects her long-time boyfriend to propose, Kirsten learns he&amp;rsquo;s been secretly seeing her best friend. Desperate to escape her feelings, she reaches for the one thing that gives her a sense of control in the midst of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this time the cut isn&amp;rsquo;t so tiny, and it lands her in the psych hospital. Within hours of being there she knows she can&amp;rsquo;t stay&amp;mdash;she isn&amp;rsquo;t crazy, after all. But she can&amp;rsquo;t go back to the life she knew before either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when her pastor mentions a treatment program on a working ranch, Kirsten decides to take him up on the offer and get away from it all. But the one thing she can&amp;rsquo;t escape is herself&amp;mdash;and her shame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ranch is home to a motley crew, each with a lesson to teach. Ever so slowly, Kirsten opens herself to embrace healing&amp;mdash;even the scarred places that hurt the most. Mercy begs her to remember the past . . . showing her there&amp;rsquo;s nothing that cannot be redeemed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;[St. James and Rue] tackle a tough topic with sensitivity and forthrightness in an intense novel about self-injury, self-esteem, and the numerous shades of love. Highly recommended.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Library Journal, &lt;/em&gt;starred review&lt;/p&gt;" />
