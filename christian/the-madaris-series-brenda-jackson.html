  <title>The Madaris Series - Brenda Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dive headfirst into the burning passion and sizzling longing of the Madaris Family series from New York Times bestselling author Brenda Jackson.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The Madaris Series bundle contains &lt;i&gt;The Midnight Hour, Unfinished Business, Slow Burn, &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Taste of Passion.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Midnight Hour&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;CIA agent Drake Warren gave his heart to a woman-a fellow Marine whose death in an explosion left him aching, and Drake vowed he would never love again. But his devotion to his former lover is tested when he meets his mysterious new partner, Agent Victoria Green. Victoria leaves Drake yearning for the love he lost-and left in the dark that she was the Marine who was in an explosion that nearly killed her. Her life-saving surgery gave her a new face and identity-but just as the passion she&#39;s denied for so long threatens to boil over, Drake begins to put together the pieces of the puzzle. And when he does, will Victoria lose him forever?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Unfinished Business&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Investigative reporter Christy Madaris doesn&#39;t want to complicate her life with romance. She made that mistake once when she believed Alex Maxwell&#39;s promise to marry her. True, Alex made that promise when Christy was just a teenager. But she believed him with all her heart-and when Alex laughed it off years later, Christy was crushed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Slow Burn&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Everything in attorney Skye Barclay&#39;s life is fitting smoothly into place until she makes the startling discovery that she was adopted. Not only does she learn that her birth mother has died, but now Skye finds out that she has a biological brother: Vincent. Skye wants to track him down, and her parents support her. But her fiancé, Wayne, refuses to accept her decision...and abruptly ends their engagement.&lt;br&gt;Skye&#39;s search for Vincent leads her to his adoptive parents, Dr. Justin and Lorren Madaris, and, lo and behold, Slade Madaris-Vincent&#39;s tall, dark, and sexy cousin. Slade is by far the most compelling man Skye has ever met, but she isn&#39;t ready to get involved so soon after Wayne&#39;s rejection...or is she?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Taste of Passion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Attorney Mackenzie &quot;Mac&quot; Standfield swore off love when her heart was shattered into a million pieces. But there&#39;s one man who has managed to tempt her beyond reason-rodeo star Luke Madaris. Although five years have passed, Mac discovers when she runs into Luke again that the sexual tension is just as charged as ever...&lt;/p&gt;" />
