  <title>And on the Eighth Day She Rested - J. D. Mason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Four different women come together under the sometimes tenuous but always unbreakable bond of friendship.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ruth Johnson has finally left her abusive husband of fourteen years and jumped feet first into &quot;What the hell do I do now?&quot; oblivion. Then into her life come three unforgettable women who turn her world upside down. Feisty, outspoken Bernice, a.k.a. &quot;Bernie,&quot; has been there and done that when it comes to love and marriage. Her ex-husband is settled down with his much younger wife and her kids are grown, and Bernie is looking to enjoy her fellow man--in more ways than one--no strings attached...or so she thinks. Sweet Southern belle May has it all: a beautiful home, two wonderful children, and a fine husband who worships the ground she walks on, yet a shadow hangs over what should be her equally perfect life, threatening to shake up her happy home. The older, wiser Clara is their guiding force, and when disaster strikes, all three women rally around her, determined to see her through it. Life is just getting interesting, and if they hold on to each other, they just might make it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.D. Mason&#39;s &lt;i&gt;And on the Eighth Day She Rested&lt;/i&gt;  is an empowering story of the tough times we all face and the friends who help us through.&lt;/p&gt;" />
