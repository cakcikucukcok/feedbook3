  <title>Heart of a Man - Maureen R. Harlacher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Things have changed a great deal in the past 3,500 years, and it may surprise you to read about the lives of long-dead biblical heroes  with new details and fresh eyes. Your understanding of the people of the Bible, how they lived, what their concerns were, their ambitions, and their fears, may just give you a new appreciation and deeper love of the Word of God.&lt;p&gt;
Secrets are revealed in history books that we never learn from the Bible or hear from the pulpit.  Maureen Harlacher has a good working knowledge of ancient Hebrew lifestyles and customs through research over time. Working with all ages over the years in hospitals and her local church has given her a well-rounded view of human nature that she weaves  together with history and biblical stories to educate and entertain you." />
