  <title>The Enchanting Adventures of Christian Nature - James A. Rousseau Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine living in a God-created heart in the world of your imagination. Imagine living in a world where the Holy Spirit, seen allegorically in the person of the beautiful patience of Christian Nature, lovingly and tenderly seeks to fill every nook and cranny of your heart with the beauty that only the Holy Spirit through Christian Nature can provide. Imagine living in a world where each citizen, like a cherished and highly valued goblet, is filled to overflowing with enchanted golden drops of comfort to freely pour upon everyone whom their lives may touch. Imagine living in a world where each citizen places their cup filled with goodness to the parched, dry lips of the weary traveler who has not tasted the refreshing drops of kindness for a long time and, in so doing, restoring life to that previously hardened person who was on the verge of losing his life to a thirst for goodness in a hardened world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the kind of world in which you would like to live? Sounds nice, you may say. But this is not real life! The purpose of this literary endeavor, the reason for this story, is to reveal to each reader that this world is real. It really does exist! It exists in our own God-created heart; and the Holy Spirit, who has filled it with the beauty of Christian Nature, lovingly invites you to live here as a cherished citizen for all the days of the enchanted adventure of your life!&lt;/p&gt;" />
