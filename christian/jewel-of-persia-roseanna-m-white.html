  <title>Jewel of Persia - Roseanna M. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How can she love the king of kings without forsaking her Lord of lords?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kasia grew up in a poor Jewish home with more siblings than luxuries. But&lt;br&gt;when a chance encounter forces her to the palace of Xerxes, she becomes a&lt;br&gt;concubine to the richest man in the world. She alone, of all Xerxes&amp;#39; wives,&lt;br&gt;loves the man beneath the crown. She alone, of all his wives, holds the&lt;br&gt;heart of the king of kings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Traveling with Xerxes through Europe as he mounts a war against Greece,&lt;br&gt;Kasia knows enemies surround her, but they&amp;#39;re not the Spartans or&lt;br&gt;Athenians. The threat lies with those close to the king who hate her&lt;br&gt;people. She determines to put her trust in Jehovah&amp;ndash;even if it costs her her&lt;br&gt;marriage.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Years of prayers are answered when Kasia&amp;#39;s childhood friend arrives at the&lt;br&gt;palace after the war, but even as she determines to see Esther crowned in&lt;br&gt;place of the bloodthirsty former queen, she knows the true battle is far&lt;br&gt;from over. How far will her enemies go to see her undone?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Combining the biblical account of Esther with Herodotus&amp;#39;s Histories, Jewel&lt;br&gt;of Persia is the story of a love that nearly destroys an empire . . . and&lt;br&gt;the friendship that saves a nation." />
