  <title>Tales of Prophet Lot (Pbuh) &amp; The People of Sodom and Gomorrah - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prophet Abraham (Pbuh) left Egypt accompanied by his nephew Propht Luth (Pbuh) or Lot, who then went to the city of Sodom (Sadum), which was on the western shore of the Dead Sea. This city was filled with evil. Its residents waylaid, robbed and killed travelers. Another common evil among them was that men had sex with men instead of with women. This unnatural act later became known as sodomy (after the city of Sodom). It was practiced openly and unashamedly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was at the height of these crimes and sins that Allah (God) revealed to Prophet Luth (Pbuh) that he should summon the people to give up their indecent behavior, but they were so deeply sunk in their immoral habits that they were deaf to Lot&amp;#39;s preaching. Swamped in their unnatural desires, they refused to listen, even when Lot warned them of Allah&amp;#39;s punishment. Instead, they threatened to drive him out of the city if he kept on preaching.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Allah the Almighty revealed: The people of Lot (those dwelt in the towns of Sodom in Palestine) belied the Messengers when their brother Lot said to them: &amp;quot;Will you not fear Allah and obey Him? Verily! I am a trustworthy Messenger to you. So fear Allah, keep your duty to Him, and obey me. No reward do I ask of you for it (my Message of Islamic Monotheism) my reward is only from the Lord of the Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists). Go you in unto the males of the Alamin (mankind), and leave those whom Allah has created for you to be your wives? Nay, you are a trespassing people!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They said: &amp;quot;If you cease not, O Lot! Verily, you will be one of those who are driven out!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
He said: &amp;quot;I am indeed, of those who disapprove with severe anger and fury your (this evil) action (of sodomy). My Lord! Save me and my family from what they do.&amp;quot;" />
