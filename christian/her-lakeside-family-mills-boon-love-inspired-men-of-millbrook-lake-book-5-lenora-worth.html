  <title>Her Lakeside Family (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (Men of Millbrook Lake, Book 5) - Lenora Worth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A Home for the Single Dad&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Landing a renovation job for a wealthy Millbrook Lake client is a coup for contractor Davina “Dani” Connell—one that could give her business a much needed boost. But Santo Alvanetti could be trouble in more ways than one. Dark, brooding and distractingly handsome, this recently widowed father of three is surrounded by sadness and shadows, much like his home.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;All good reasons not to become emotionally involved. They may be complete opposites, but there’s something irresistible about Santo. Dani’s determined to give him and his children the new home and future they deserve. But could she also be the wife and mom they need?&lt;/p&gt;
