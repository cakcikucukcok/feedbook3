  <title>Where It All Began: A &quot;Heartbeats&quot; Novel - Lorana L Hoopes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sandra Baker had a great boyfriend, Peter, and was training to be a nurse. When she found out she was pregnant, her life turned upside down. After days of discussion, Peter decided he didn&amp;#39;t want the baby and pushed Sandra to have an abortion. After the procedure, Sandra faces an emptiness she never thought possible. She is haunted by phantom cries and dreams of her unborn child. Unable to cope, Sandra turns to alcohol and withdraws. Her relationship with Peter suffers and eventually ends. With Peter and everything that reminded her of the abortion gone, Sandra begins to heal. She meets Henry Dobbs, a strong Christian man who introduces her to God and begins to change her life, but her secret keeps her from accepting God fully or his forgiveness. After marrying Henry, she finds out she is no longer able to have children, and the result is catastrophic. A car crash leaves Sandra paralyzed and kills Henry. Sandra falls back on the crutch that got her through before: alcohol, and she loses everything. But God puts a strong Christian couple in her path and they take her in and give her a new purpose in life as a prayer warrior. Will Sandra finally be able to forgive herself and accept God&amp;#39;s healing?&lt;/p&gt;" />
