Lindsay is happily looking forward to the day she becomes Matthew Glick&amp;rsquo;s wife and is excited for the plans he has for the house he will build her. So, when Matthew suddenly calls off the wedding, she is blindsided. She knows there is more to the story than what he is telling her, but will he open up and let her in on his own heartbreak?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where the Heart Is&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tobias Smucker is back home, and it&amp;rsquo;s no secret he and his father are still not on the best of terms. But what is surprising is that his little sister&amp;rsquo;s best friend, Mariella, has been harboring her own secret feelings for Tobias. With her help, he begins to unravel a family mystery and learns that everyone has their own hidden depths, including his father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Love Birds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(previously published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An Amish Market&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ellie Lapp and her mother are still mourning the loss of her brother, Seth, Ellie starts working at one of the gift shops in town. Seth&amp;rsquo;s friend Lloyd is talented at carving wooden birds, but his father disapproves and expects him to take over the family farm someday. Ellie sees the beauty in Lloyd&amp;rsquo;s creations and insists Lloyd sell the birds in the gift shop where she works. As Ellie and Lloyd spend more time together, they begin to develop feelings for one another, but she accidentally betrays his trust. Will she lose any hope of a future with him?&lt;/p&gt;" />
