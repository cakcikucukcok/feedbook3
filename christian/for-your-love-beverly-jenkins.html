  <title>For Your Love - Beverly Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;NAACP nominee and bestselling author Beverly Jenkins returns to Henry Adams, Kansas&amp;#8212;an unforgettable place that anyone would want to call home&amp;#8212;with a story of family, friends, and the powerful forces from our past that can irrevocably shape our future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mayor Trent July and his wife Lily are enjoying life as newlyweds and embracing the challenges and joys that come with being foster parents to two wonderful boys. But being a foster father has inevitably forced him to think about his own birth mother. Raised by his grandmother Tamar&amp;#8212;and in many ways the good people of Henry Adams&amp;#8212;Trent was blessed with a childhood full of love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now he can&amp;#8217;t help wondering what happened to the scared teenage girl who handed him over to Tamar. And questions that he&amp;#8217;s never voiced are now begging to be answered: Who was she? Is she still alive? Why didn&amp;#8217;t she want him?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trent has always believed no good comes from dwelling on the past, especially when you have a loving family, a strong community, and folks who depend on him. But when the past comes to Henry Adams and Trent has no choice but to face it&amp;#8212;and the woman who left him behind. The truth will shake his very being and everything he thought he knew about life, love, and the bonds that hold families together&amp;#8230;yet can also tear them apart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
