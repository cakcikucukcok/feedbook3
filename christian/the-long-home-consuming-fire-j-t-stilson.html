  <title>The Long Home: Consuming Fire - J.T. Stilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adam, Nim, and Pete (aka Rocky) have been reunited in a new world and their past grievances have been resolved. Adam has embraced his new role as teacher and innovator, and soon he and Nim become fascinated with science research and rediscovering technology. There&amp;#39;s much to uncover about the new earth they inhabit, which has different universal laws they must face and decipher. And who should arrive in their midst to help them organize science expeditions? None other than a famous scientist from the past. What this learned figure guides them to discover is invaluable to their understanding of the new world. Meanwhile, Prince Kristos has established his realm but hints of insurrection trouble him. Can he preserve the peace?&amp;nbsp; With Teufel out of control it will take all Kristos&amp;#39; strength and wiles. Something must change to maintain world unity and harmony. If Teufel overcomes the Prince it will mean the end of the new earth. What will happen next?&amp;nbsp; The &lt;em&gt;Consuming Fire&lt;/em&gt; offers many surprising twists and turns as the story of the long home continues.&lt;/p&gt;" />
