  <title>A McClendon Thanksgiving - Sean D. Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fashion designer Faith McClendon is back in Chicago to start over. She put her promising career on hold for too long, and she&#39;s ready to get back in the game. Her heart is another matter. She&#39;s not willing to put that on the line again--it&#39;s still far too bruised from her failed marriage for that. So when a renewed childhood friendship starts to make her think about second chances at love, she&#39;s more than a little hesitant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Photographer Michael Montgomery was Faith&#39;s biggest cheerleader when she decided to move to New York City, and he&#39;s been her shoulder to cry on since she came home to Chicago. The timing has never been right to tell her how he feels, but maybe now is his chance. First, he&#39;s going to have to break down the walls Faith has around her heart and convince her they can be so much more than friends.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the McClendon Holiday series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* A McClendon Thanksgiving&lt;br&gt;* The Christmas Promise&lt;br&gt;* A Husband by New Year&#39;s&lt;br&gt;* Be My Valentine&lt;/p&gt;" />
