And until Welco&#39;s president meets with her, Crystal will wage a fiery one-woman protest to prove it! But when he finally appears, Douglas Wellington III is far from the elderly curmudgeon she expected.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tall, lean, and fabulous, Douglas is in for a surprise of his own. Crystal&#39;s cafe au lait beauty takes his breath away. Still, if she had any sense, she&#39;d realize his project will save the impoverished community. With battle lines drawn, Crystal issues Douglas a challenge: spend one week on the land he wants to destroy. He agrees, if only to be alone with her.
