  <title>The Under Texas Stars Collection - Colleen Coble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now available in one volume, &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; best-selling author Colleen Coble&amp;rsquo;s Under Texas Stars series!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Moon Promise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lucy Marsh&#39;s worldly resources are running out, but she&#39;s fiercely determined to care for her younger brother and sister. When she discovers that their father&#39;s recent death was no accident, Lucy is eager to leave town. She accepts a proxy marriage she believes will provide safe refuge. But trouble follows her to Texas where her new husband is surprised to suddenly have a wife and children to care for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blue Moon Promise&lt;/em&gt; is a story of hope, romance, and suspense . . . immersing the reader in a rich historical tale set under the Texas stars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Safe in His Arms&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Margaret O&amp;rsquo;Brien&amp;rsquo;s father hires Daniel Cutler as a new foreman, she&amp;rsquo;s frustrated and suspicious of her father&amp;rsquo;s intentions. Then an overheard conversation links the man with a gang of bank robbers, and she&amp;rsquo;s downright worried. Daniel swears he&amp;rsquo;s not involved, but Margaret&amp;rsquo;s not convinced. She knows the man still has secrets. But would a criminal be so kind and talk so convincingly of his faith? As a series of tragic &amp;ldquo;accidents&amp;rdquo; threatens all she holds dear, Margaret must decide what to trust: her own ears, her best judgment . . . or what her heart keeps telling her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the author of the best-selling &lt;em&gt;Blue Moon Promise&lt;/em&gt; . . . an exciting tale of danger, romance, and faith played out under the Texas stars.&lt;/p&gt;" />
