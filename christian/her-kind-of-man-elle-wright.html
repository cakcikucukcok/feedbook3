      <meta name="description" content="When Mr. Right is oh so wrong &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  I&#39;ll never let you go . . . Allina had always dreamed of hearing those words. But when her fiance, Isaac, utters them, it isn&#39;t a promise-it&#39;s a threat. Scared and confused, with only moments before the wedding, Allina knows what she must do. Forget walking down the aisle; it&#39;s time to run. Back to Michigan. Back to Kent. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Kent has loved Allina for longer than he can remember. Out of respect for their friendship, he&#39;s never crossed the line, but when she turns up on his doorstep wearing her torn, tearstained wedding gown, the fire inside him ignites. He&#39;ll do whatever it takes to make Allina feel safe-like the beautiful, desirable woman she is. But as Kent and Allina grow closer, and their passion pushes deeper, it&#39;s clear that something bigger than a botched wedding still lingers between them . . ." />
