  <title>Covenant of War - Cliff Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year is 993 BC. After years of bloody civil war, Eleazar son of Dodai, one of King David&amp;rsquo;s most elite warriors, wants nothing more than to finally live peacefully in the land. But on the plains near the Great Sea, a terrifying army of Philistines has mobilized to crush the Hebrew tribes once and for all. In the sun-drenched valleys and dark forests of the hill country, Eleazar and his warriors make their stand against Israel&amp;rsquo;s deadliest enemy. The fate of an entire nation rests on the courage of a small band of heroes known as the Mighty Men. In a land torn by conflict, depleted by drought and threatened by treachery, the horrors and heroism of the ancient battlefields come to life. This ebook download of Covenant of War is the second book in the Lion of War series&amp;mdash;the intense, gritty, and stylistic portrayal of the Mighty Men of Israel, a rag-tag band of warriors who came to King David in his most desperate hour and fought with him while he claimed the throne he was destined to fill. Their legendary deeds are recorded in 2 Samuel 23 and 1 Chronicles 11.&lt;/p&gt;" />
