  <title>An Amish Quilt - Beth Wiseman, Kathleen Fuller, Kelly Irvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Patchwork Perfect&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Beth Wiseman (previously published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An Amish Year&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eli Byler has been a widower for two years when he chooses to make a fresh start in Paradise, Pennsylvania. As Eli juggles the admiration of two women, he meets Miriam Fisher&amp;mdash;the most unconventional Amish woman he&amp;rsquo;s ever met. She doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit the mold for what Eli is looking for, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t long before Eli realizes that Miriam is everything he wants. But Miriam has no plans to get married&amp;mdash;ever. Will Eli be able to change her mind?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Bid for Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Kathleen Fuller (previously published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An Amish Market&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every week, Hannah Lynne brings her home-churned butter to the local market. And every week Ezra stops by to purchase some. Hannah Lynne knows not to read too much into it&amp;mdash;Ezra is a confirmed bachelor and barely even glances her way, despite any hope to the contrary. But when Ezra bids an exorbitant amount to win the quilt she had her heart set on, Hannah Lynne can&amp;rsquo;t stop her heart from taking over her mind. Could Ezra finally be in the market for love?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Midwife&amp;rsquo;s Dream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Kelly Irvin (previously published in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;An Amish Heirloom&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iris Beachy serves as a midwife in her district where she longs for a family of her own. When her friend&amp;rsquo;s brother Mahon Kurtz seeks her help in delivering the baby of two young teenagers who have sought refuge in their town, they begin to see each other in a different light. Unprepared for parenthood, the young couple leave their baby girl behind in an antique crib quilt resembling the one destined for Iris when she becomes a mother. Mahon and Iris come together to take care of the baby as they try to find her parents, and they begin to see new possibilities for their future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
