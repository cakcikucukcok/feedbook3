  <title>Hunt For God&#39;s Chosen - Ian Fairfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, America realized its worst fear when radical Islamic terrorists, led by the Satanic Persian, Saeed Kurush Golzar, attempted to prevent Middle East peace by invading America&amp;rsquo;s heartland with a targeted killing raid.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Between 1946 and 1956, archaeologists discover 972 scrolls in eleven caves near the Dead Sea. Then unexpectedly, an Israeli and Egyptian archaeologist co-discovered the 973&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; scroll. When translated, No. 973 prophesied the coming of God&amp;#39;s Chosen almost sixty years from the scroll&amp;rsquo;s discovery and warned that Saeed, the leader of Quds, the most powerful terrorist organization in the world, will vow to kill the Chosen and their Protectors. Should the Chosen survive, the Middle East will realize peace, and Saeed Kurush Golzar will become a minor historical footnote. Stopping the terrorists is the mission of the Protectors, code named Rock ONE. Ben &amp;ldquo;Yoman&amp;rdquo; Friedman, Israeli military tactician, arms Rock ONE with a brilliant strategic plan to defy all odds, protect the Chosen and bring peace. It is no accident that Rock ONE is comprised of just two people and a dog. Sarah Jennings, orphaned by the attacks on 9/11, masterfully trained in Mossad fighting techniques, and the world&amp;#39;s best sharpshooter is complimented perfectly by Ari Cohen, legendary Mossad warrior, whose rugged good looks are as deadly as his fighting skills. The aptly named Rock, a Belgian Malinois dog, with titanium equipped teeth, jaws of death and the scent and speed of no other four-legged creature completes Rock ONE.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can such a small fighting unit defeat hundreds of expertly trained Islamic terrorists out to kill them at all costs? Can Rock ONE and the Chosen find love and peace amongst the horrific chaos? Fasten your seat belts and hold on as you read this heart-pounding, white knuckle thriller!&lt;/p&gt;" />
