  <title>Fairer than Morning - Rosslyn Elliott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ann dreams of a marriage proposal from her poetic suitor, Eli—until Will Hanby shows her that nobility is more than fine words.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;On a small farm in 19th-century Ohio, young Ann Miller is pursued by the gallant Eli Bowen, son of a prominent family. Eli is the suitor of Ann&#39;s dreams. Like her, he enjoys poetry and beautiful things and soon, he will move to the city to become a doctor.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ann travels to Pittsburgh, accompanying her father on business. There she meets Will Hanby, a saddle-maker&#39;s apprentice. Will has spent years eking out an existence under a cruel master and his spirit is nearly broken. But Ann&#39;s compassion lights a long-dark part of his soul. Through his encounters with Ann&#39;s father, a master saddler, Will discovers new hope and courage in the midst of tremendous adversity.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When the Millers must return to Ohio and their ministry there, Will resolves to find them, at any cost. If Will can make it back to Ann, will she be waiting?&lt;/P&gt;" />
