  <title>Boyfriend Shopping: Shopping for My Boyfriend / My Only Wish / All I Want for Christmas Is You (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Tru) - Earl Sewell, Caridad Ferrer, Deidre Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Holidays mean family, friends, presents–and extra doses of drama! But for three girls, the one gift they weren&#39;t expecting may be everything they ever hoped for…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Shopping for My Boyfriend by Earl Sewell&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Jeremy, Anna&#39;s longtime crush, asks her to be his girlfriend, it&#39;s a yuletide surprise she never saw coming. And in order to get him the perfect gift, she will have to do a total 180 from shy girl to outrageous reality-show contestant. But to discover what Jeremy truly desires for Christmas, Anna will have to get close and risk her heart….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;My Only Wish by Caridad Ferrer&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Claudia Abreu knew her family was doing more than hiding presents and heating up Cuban cider for her holiday homecoming. Just her luck–her childhood friend, who has been invited as her New Year&#39;s Eve party date, is athletic and popular…pretty much everything she&#39;s not. But David Levy hopes he finally has the chance to show Claudia that they really do have enough in common to make both of their dreams come true…together.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;All I Want for Christmas Is You by Deidre Berry&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bree Calloway&#39;s holiday is off to one very un-merry start. First, her boyfriend, Lance, is keeping secrets. Second, getting the lead in The Nutcracker means facing off with a dance-diva-from-hell. And third, the chemistry between Bree and her know-it-all ballet partner, David, is sparking way too hot. Now Bree has one chance to straighten out this tangled tinsel–and make her Christmas truly bright.&lt;/p&gt;
