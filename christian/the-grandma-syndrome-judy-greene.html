  <title>The Grandma Syndrome - Judy Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ann Finlaysons self-centered world is crashed when she grudgingly agrees to do her sister a favor: watch Valerie, her eleven-year-old niece, while her sister goes out of town for a job interview.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Because Ann knows nothing about relating to children, shes infernally frustrated by the challenge of entertaining and caring for her niece.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Disaster strikes one frenzied morning as Ann attempts to navigate through rush hour traffic in downtown Chicago. Due to an ugly skirmish with Valerie on the way to school, her stress strings are already strained to the max. In this volatile state, she blows up on a mysterious old woman who holds her up in a crosswalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the course of her life is changed forever.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Journey with Ann as an unlikely cast of players unwittingly join forces to support her in her new life. Bradley Newman, a kind-hearted coworker; Charlotte, a benevolent shop owner; Lisa, a parent struggling with her childs health issues; and Anns sister, Sara, all play vital roles in introducing Ann to a side of life shes never experienced before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasantly unexpected is how I would describe my journey through The Grandma Syndrome. I was invested early on, and my expectations were wildly exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abbie H.W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with humor, tenderness and romantic mystery, this book will keep you engaged all the way to the end.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Tina V.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A captivating story of redemption and the healing power of love. Definitely a book worth reading.&lt;/p&gt;
