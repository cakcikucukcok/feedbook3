  <title>Unfinished Business - Brenda Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Hot and sexy.&quot;--Romance Reader at HeartTM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A PROMISE MADE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigative reporter Christy Madaris doesn&#39;t want to complicate her life with romance. She made that mistake once when she believed Alex Maxwell&#39;s promise to marry her. True, Alex made that promise when Christy was just a teenager. But she believed him with all her heart--and when Alex laughed it off years later, Christy was crushed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A PROMISE BROKEN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The owner of his own P.I. firm, Alex refuses to compromise everything he&#39;s worked for to honor a silly promise. Christy should have known he was only teasing, right? But when Alex finally sees Christy again, he knows he made a big mistake. She has grown up into a smart and stunning woman--and Alex can&#39;t get her off his mind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A LOVE THEY CAN&#39;T FORGET...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;When Christy&#39;s latest story takes a dark turn, the Madaris brothers ask Alex to keep her safe. But putting Alex in charge of Christy is like putting a rooster in charge of the hen house! The more she snubs him, the more he wants her. But when Christy&#39;s life is in danger, can Alex save her before it&#39;s too late? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A perfect balance of tension and chemistry.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
