  <title>Thy Brother&#39;s Wife - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The direction of Paul and Sean Cronin&#39;s lives was shaped the day their father, a self-made multimillionaire, decided that one of his boys would grow up to be a cardinal while the other would become president of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For his elder son, Paul, the father had even chosen a wife--the beautiful Nora, who had come to the Cronin home as an orphan child years before. Obediently, and with a genuine vocation, the younger son, Sean, went into the priesthood. With a more cynical view, Paul went to Notre Dame to prepare for a life in politics until the Korean War intervened. Then came the news--Paul Cronin was missing in action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;If he dies,&quot; Sean&#39;s father told him, &quot;you must leave the seminary and marry Nora.&quot; The words sang in Sean&#39;s head. Could he renounce his sacred calling--and marry the girl he had always loved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long out of print, &lt;i&gt;Thy Brother&#39;s Wife&lt;/i&gt; is a classic tale by one of America&#39;s most loved storytellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
