  <title>Arms of Love - Kelly Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;The year is 1777. America is in turmoil.&amp;nbsp; And Amish life is far different than today.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Pennsylvania in the late 18&lt;SUP&gt;th&lt;/SUP&gt; century, once called William Penn’s Woods, was an assortment of different faiths living together for the first time in American history. Included in this tapestry was a small and struggling population called Amish. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Surrounding this peaceful people were unavoidable threats: both Patriots and the British&amp;nbsp;were pillaging land and goods for the sake of the war, young Amishmen were leaving the faith to take up arms and defend freedom. A simple walk in the untamed forests could result in death, if not from bullet or arrow, then from an encounter with a wild animal.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Amid this time of tumult, Adam Wyse is fighting a personal battle. To possibly join the war efforts and leave his faith, which would mean walking away from the only woman he’s ever loved: Lena Yoder. But for that love he’s made a promise that may keep them apart permanently.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;When Adam withdraws from Lena, she’s forced to turn to his brother, Isaac, for support. Must Lena deny her heart’s desire to save Adam’s soul?&lt;B&gt; &lt;/B&gt;And will life in this feral and primitive New World be more than this peace-keeping people can withstand?&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“There is a beautiful love story that unfolds within the pages . . . I was vested in the lives of these characters from the first page.” —BETH WISEMAN, best-selling author of &lt;I&gt;The Wonder of Your Love&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Plain Proposal&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
