  <title>Dirty Diaries - Bayo Inc. David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Judas Duncan was born dirt poor. Through hard work, he manages to become a professor of criminology by the age of 25. His good looks and promising future all come to a crashing halt one day when he is arrested in his classroom. His story of struggle and forgiveness could have happened anywhere. Judas fights to prove himself innocent of a crime he didn&amp;#39;t commit, but instead ends up spending 18 years in prison. Once released, he can only think of vengeance, and seeks retaliation against the government that jailed him by counterfeiting money. After he discovers his wife is unfaithful and the son he raised is not his own, he finally finds forgiveness within himself and starts life anew as a pastor." />
