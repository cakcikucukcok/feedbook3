  <title>The Cardinal Virtues - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Father Laurence O&#39;Toole McAuliffe, the pastor of Saint Finian&#39;s parish in Forest Springs, is weary and worn out, his priesthood and faith in tatters. Once literally a bomb-throwing radical and then a Vatican Council liberal, Lar McAuliffe has grown old and cynical. To make matters worse, he&#39;s smart enough to know what is happening to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God, the cardinal, or some combination of the two plays a dirty trick on Lar by sending him Father James Stephen Michael Finbar Keenan, the &quot;new priest.&quot; Lar expects a classic confrontation between young and old, between sardonic maturity and enthusiastic inexperience. But the new priest does not fit the stereotype and the two become friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they face the conflicts and joys, the hopes and pains of the contemporary Catholic parish--the old-fashioned school principal; the broken family; the reactionary finance committee; frustrated young lovers; and the chancery office and a timid Cardinal, who interferes with the priests&#39; work on every possible occasion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternately sad and uproariously funny, &lt;i&gt;The Cardinal Virtues&lt;/i&gt; is about the meaning of religion, the meaning of faith, and the meaning of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
