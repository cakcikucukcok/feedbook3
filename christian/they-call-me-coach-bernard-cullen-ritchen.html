  <title>They Call Me Coach - Bernard Cullen Ritchen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For over thirty years, Bob Jenkins had been defined by wins and losses in college basketball. As a highly successful Division I head basketball coach, he had reached the pinnacle of his profession. Then one day, without warning, he finds himself being dismissed from coaching by the athletic director of the university. He is angry and confused about how to navigate this turn of events and what to do with the rest of his life. His wife, Sarah, feels that God is moving in his life and leading him in another direction. Bob feels to the contrary that God has forsaken him. Against his better judgment and with pressure from Sarah and their twin daughters, he retires and moves to Florida to begin again. Then one day while working out at the local YMCA he happens upon a Special Olympics basketball team practicing. The thought of God leading him in another direction resurfaces. He will coach again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
