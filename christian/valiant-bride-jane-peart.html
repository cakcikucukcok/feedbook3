  <title>Valiant Bride - Jane  Peart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Noramary came out of the parlor into the hall. Stunned by what she had just heard, she felt slightly light-headed and leaned against the closed door for a moment to steady herself. The shock of Winnie&#39;s elopement during the night had been followed by a second -- the staggering request of her foster parents that she step into her errant cousin&#39;s place as the bride of Duncan Montrose! &quot;So you see, my dear, why we must ask this of you?&quot; Aunt Betsy&#39;s voice rang in her ears. Noramary closed her eyes, bringing back the scene that had just taken place. As her aunt had explained the dilemma Winnie&#39;s irresponsibility had caused and what must now be done, Noramary had sat very still, eyes downcast, hands folded in her lap, hearing but not fully absorbing her aunt&#39;s words. Now those same words burst upon her, strong and clear: &quot;--marry Duncan Montrose!&quot; Valiant Bride is a historical romance that brings to life a young woman&#39;s choice between duty and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
