  <title>Nantucket Romance 3-in-1 Bundle - Denise Hunter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surrender Bay&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once childhood friends, single-mom Samantha and her former boyfriend Landon are now separated by distance and secrets. As their long-dormant romance begins to bud again, Samantha must face a past that separated her from the God of her childhood. And she must tell Landon why she fled the island in the first place--a secret that could tear them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Convenient Groom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five hours before her Nantucket beach wedding&amp;mdash;and on the eve of her big book launch&amp;mdash;celebrity marriage counselor Kate Lawrence has everything in place; everything, that is, but the groom. Could it be that God&#39;s plans for &amp;ldquo;Dr. Kate&amp;rdquo; don&#39;t align perfectly with her to-do list? And will Kate realize that the truest love she&#39;ll ever receive can only come from God?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seaside Letters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sabrina never intended to fall in love with Tucker, the man she serves coffee every morning at a Nantucket cafe&amp;mdash;especially since he&#39;s unwittingly tied to a past she deeply regrets. When Tucker learns Sabrina is the research assistant for a local mystery writer, he asks Sabrina to help him with a little sleuthing of his own . . . locating an elusive woman he&#39;s fallen for online. If Sabrina accepts the job, she&#39;ll spend her evenings in close proximity to a man who can never be hers. If she turns him down, he&#39;ll hire someone else and discover her secret . . . that the person he&#39;s trying to find is her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
