  <title>Irish Tiger - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wife, mother, lover, celebrated singer, and problem solver Nuala Anne McGrail has a tender side that she often shows to her devoted friends and family. But when those under her protection are in danger, she becomes a veritable Irish Tiger, akin to the fierce warrior women of ancient Erin. With Dermot, her loyal husband, in tow, there are few mysteries she can&#39;t untangle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The couple will need all their resources when they come to the aid of two loving senior citizens, whose unexpected romance has been targeted by an unknown enemy. John Patrick Donlan and Maria Angelica Connors were both grandparents when they met, and their passionate connection took them each by surprise. But Donlan&#39;s daughters and in-laws bitterly oppose the match...and someone will stop at nothing to destroy their marriage, their thriving careers, and maybe even their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a touch fey, Nuala senses genuine evil at work here, and so do the keen senses of her ever-present Irish wolfhounds. As the attacks grow ever more serious, it may be up to one gifted woman and a pair of retired police dogs to prevent a touching love story from ending in unspeakable tragedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
