  <title>Dusty and the Cowboy 3: Coming Home - T.W. Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cowboy rides his big horse, Dusty, back to Atascosa after finding the answers he was seeking on that long journey. To reach the home place, he must first make amends to the one man he wronged years earlier. They meet by accident in an unexpected small town. What transpires there changes Cowboy&amp;#39;s life for ever.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In a poignant reunion, Cowboy keeps his promise to the young girl he met on the way up the trail. Her gratitude at this small gesture cements their avuncular relationship, and leaves Cowboy with a lightened heart. Her new husband offers Cowboy the first meaningful work he&amp;#39;s had in more than a year. But Cowboy knows that reaching home must take precedent.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And where would Cowboy be if he did not help someone out on the trail? A pair of newcomers from the city are about to starve to death on an inherited homestead. In return for a barn to sleep in, Cowboy shows them what they need to make it through the winter, This bounty is contrast to the unexpected gift Cowboy received but did not discover until he was down the trail weeks later.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book is the third in&amp;nbsp;the trilogy called DUSTY AND THE COWBOY.&lt;/p&gt;" />
