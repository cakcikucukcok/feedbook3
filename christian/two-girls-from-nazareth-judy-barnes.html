  <title>Two Girls from Nazareth - Judy Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Long ago in a faraway land, two little girls are born to different families in the town of Nazareth. As Mary and Mary Elizabeth grow up, they become best friends who both hope to be the virgin mother of the long-awaited Messiah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary Elizabeth has a natural exuberance for life. Mary, on the other hand, is reserved, quiet, and obedient. As the two girls mature into teenagers, each contemplates whether she is the Chosen One to bring the Christ Child into the world. Before Mary Elizabeth marries John, the bakers son, she has a vivid dream that seems to foretell of the Messiahs birth in a manger. Mary, who has just become betrothed to Joseph, the carpenters son, believes it is her best friend who will be Jesuss mother. But as Mary Elizabeth continues to be plagued by seemingly prophetic dreams, it is not until she is visited by the Lord that she finally receives the answer she needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two Girls from Nazareth shares a fictionalized adaptation of what might have happened between two teenage girls contemplating which one of them is the Chosen One who will birth the Christ Child.&lt;/p&gt;" />
