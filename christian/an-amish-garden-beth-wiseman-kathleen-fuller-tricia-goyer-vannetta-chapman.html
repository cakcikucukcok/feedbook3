  <title>An Amish Garden - Beth Wiseman, Kathleen Fuller, Tricia Goyer, Vannetta Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gardens are a place to rest, to draw near, and to heal.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Where Healing Blooms&amp;rdquo; by Vannetta Chapman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Widow Emma Hochstetter discovers a run-away teenager in her barn, and the bishop asks her to provide a haven for a local woman and her two children she finds her quiet life has been interrupted. Then, her mother-in-law, Mary Ann, reveals one of her garden&#39;s hidden secrets, something very unexpected. Will she continue alone or will she accept the gifts God has given her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Flowers for Rachael&quot; by Kathleen Fuller&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rachael Bontrager&amp;rsquo;s flower garden is beautiful, but at twenty-four, she&amp;rsquo;s &amp;nbsp;lonely. Gideon Beiler fell in love with Rachael almost at first sight. After her grandfather has a stroke, her days are filled with caring for him, and one day Rachael finds her garden in shambles. However, she won&amp;rsquo;t accept Gideon&amp;rsquo;s offers of help. Will she realize she doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to do everything on her own and that God is in control?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Seeds of Love&amp;rdquo; by Tricia Goyer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadie Chupp finds her greatest joy in the greenhouses in her Montana community. A company is interested in buying her heirloom seeds, but they are the only thing she has left from her deceased parents. Eli Plank is a traveling bachelor who believes he can help Sadie, but a misunderstanding leaves her heartbroken. Will she trust him again, and let the seeds of a new relationship&amp;nbsp;take root?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Rooted in Love&amp;rdquo; by Beth Wiseman&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosemary Lantz is doing her best to run her family&amp;rsquo;s household. She excels at all her tasks except one: gardening. Saul Petersheim has pursued Rosemary for years, but Rosemary keeps turning him down.&amp;nbsp; What Saul doesn&amp;rsquo;t know is that she has good reason&amp;mdash;something no one can know&amp;mdash;especially not him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;. . . [&lt;em&gt;An Amish Garden&lt;/em&gt;] is a perfect selection of stories that will lift your heart, inspire your faith, and encourage your green thumb.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;CBA Retailers + Resources&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
