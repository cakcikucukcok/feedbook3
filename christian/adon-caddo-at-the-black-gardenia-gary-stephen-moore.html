  <title>Adon Caddo at the Black Gardenia - Gary Stephen Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adon Caddo was one of many adons (lords) created by God (AdonaiLord of Lords) to act as overlords of his divine plan. Until the temple veil was rent, Adon Caddo was assigned to the priestly order of the chosen people, following their tumultuous history. After Christs work was accomplished, Adonai relocated the adons throughout the world, each at the mouth of a great river. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adon Caddo, whose name means reddish glow, was sent to the swamp region of the Mighty River of North America.. There, on an insignificant island, on a bayou, in a swamp but near New Orleans, he erected a dwelling that became known as the Black Gardenia because of the abundance of this intoxicatingly aromatic flower.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For the next many centuries, Adon Caddo, along with his pelican companion Pel subtly influenced countless individuals to seek Christ while they could. These individuals included a refugee French child who became Mama Bayou, a family seeking passage on the Underground Railway, the infamous courtesan Catia Renata, the murderer who thought of himself as the artist, a voodoo king transformed into the preacher man, and many others transformed by Adon Caddo and the Black Gardenia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
