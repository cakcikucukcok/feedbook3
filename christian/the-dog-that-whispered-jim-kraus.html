  <title>The Dog That Whispered - Jim Kraus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Jim Kraus returns with a heartwarming tale about a dog who has people convinced he can talk.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Wilson Steele is a single professor and Vietnam veteran who likes living alone, insisting it&#39;s too late for him to have a family. His mother disagrees. When she impulsively adopts a rescued black lab mix, she insists Thurman is special, and has whispered of the coming of grandchildren. Wilson brushes the notion off as fantasy. When his mother learns of her retirement community&#39;s &#39;no pets&#39; policy, she forces Wilson to take the lovable dog. Wilson notices Thurman&#39;s growls do sound like words, but he knows he&#39;s just projecting his own thoughts on the animal. If Wilson is talking to neighbors on their walks, and spending time with Emily, a widow with three children, it isn&#39;t because Thurman encouraged him. After all, everyone knows dogs can&#39;t talk...can they?&lt;/div&gt;" />
