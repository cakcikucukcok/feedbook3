  <title>Birthright - Michael Rennie Vinet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael Rennie Vinet knits a story of five young adults from different walks of life in the city of Redemption. Amy is The Flower Girl. Even though she has special needs, it doesnt stop her from giving a rose to all the hurting people she encounters. Kevin is a go-getter with ambition. Growing up, he notices that he doesnt share the same hereditary traits with the rest of his family. Is he adopted? The truth is far worse than he imagines. He is able to overcome this blindside and reach out in forgiveness. Bethany is a young cancer researcher trying to find that elusive cure in honour of her little brother who dies of the disease. Anthony follows in his grandfathers footsteps as a cop. He has worked as an internet crime specialist and is now running an undercover operation where the drug dealers lurk. Davin finds salvation in a most unique way. He is able to shed his life of sin and goes to work for God Almighty. These are Redemptions darlings. But their stories unravel from there. A villain emerges. It comes to steal, kill and destroy and has all the legal authority to do it. Abortion. In their own words, these people talk about how their trajectories are bumped off course by an alternate decision &lt;p&gt;
BIRTHRIGHT is a compassionate plea for life! It sensitively declares that we all have that rightno matter who we are! It may inspire you to rethink your views" />
