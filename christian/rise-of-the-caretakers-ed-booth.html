  <title>Rise of the Caretakers - Ed Booth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Father Jean came and stood next to Darby as he reclined and said, I will be returning to the abbey. I will pray for yer soul Darby and ask god what ye need to pay. It could be quite a substantial sum as ye have lived a very sinful life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, yesI know, but it will be worth it to avoid the fiery flames. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the first time, and in a perplexed tone of voice, Christian spoke to Father Jean, You are not serious? Making Darby pay for forgiveness, a gift that is freely given. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a look of incredulity, Father Jean replied, Darbys sins are great and the cost of penance must equally fit his crimes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You heard him. The next time he meets the Death Angel he will be taken to Hell and left there. If he doesnt pay for his sins he has no hope of avoiding the fiery flames. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaking in anger, Christian looked straight into the eyes of Darby OHerlihy and said, Do not listen to this fool, Darby! To be a Christian is to believe that Jesus Christ came to this world to offer His life as a ransom for those who would believe and entrust their lives to Him. His shed blood upon the cross is the payment for your sins. It is not something we as men pay for monetarily! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that be the case, then the poor and needy are doomed to die and to be carried to the fiery pit to burn there forever separated from a loving and caring God. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is written: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For God so loved the world, 
that He gave His only begotten Son, John 3:16 [KJV] 
that whosoever believeth in Him 
should not perish, but have everlasting life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In anger Father Jean responded, Where are these written Words you speak of and who has them? Are you the Caretaker of them? If you are produce them so that we can see them for ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
