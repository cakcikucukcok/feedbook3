  <title>Wounded Healer - Donna Fleisher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Flooded with panic, two words burst through Erin&amp;rsquo;s mind: GET HELP. She ran for the door, but someone grabbed her, twisted her arm behind her. Erin&amp;rsquo;s shriek was smothered by a cold, clammy hand. &amp;ldquo;Shhh&amp;mdash;&amp;rdquo; Breath tickled her ear&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;Just take it easy. . . .&amp;rdquo; Surrounded by the oppressive sand, heat, and tension of Operation Desert Storm, soldiers Erin Grayson and Christina McIntyre shared a special bond. But when an ugly secret from Chris&amp;rsquo; past shattered their close friendship, they went their separate ways without even a goodbye. Four years have gone by since that day in the desert, but Chris has spent her entire life running from the past, hiding her deepest secrets from those who care for her most. And now tragedy has ripped apart her life. She sees no hope in tomorrow. It&amp;rsquo;s a good day to die. . . . Overcoming her own anger and doubt, Erin rushes to Chris&amp;rsquo; Colorado cabin. When Chris&amp;rsquo; fear of God and Erin&amp;rsquo;s faith in Him collide, they are involved in a different kind of war that only one of them can win. As Chris wrestles with grief, fear, and ghosts from the past, Erin fights to pull her from the brink of self-destruction. She will not lose Chris again. Chris&amp;rsquo; life is at stake . . . as well as her soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
