As police focus on the wrong set of clues, the three sisters and their battered detective friend are the only hope for solving this bizarre crime, saving the child, and freeing their brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A story rich with texture and suspense, this family murder mystery unfolds with fast pacing, a creepy clown murder suspect, and threatening blog visitor to boot.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Truth Stained Lies&lt;/em&gt; is the first in what&amp;rsquo;s likely to be a very popular new series for Blackstock.
