      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priscilla Allgyer, a young single mother, knows she cannot leave the past behind. But can love lead her toward the promise of healing?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Priscilla Allgyer left her community to escape the expectations of Amish life. Now, years later, she is forced to return&amp;mdash;along with her six-year-old son&amp;mdash;to the place she thought she&amp;rsquo;d left behind forever. Though once estranged from her family, Priscilla is welcomed by her mother, but her father is cold and strict. He allows Priscilla to stay with them provided she dresses plainly, confesses her sins, and agrees to marry within the community. Once again, she feels suffocated, trapped, and alone.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Priscilla reluctantly completes her shunning, she catches the eye of Mark Riehl, a farmer with a playboy reputation. Wary of Mark, Priscilla barely gives him the time of day&amp;mdash;while Mark, unused to being ignored by the women of Bird-in-Hand, won&amp;rsquo;t give up the pursuit of her friendship. Priscilla desperately needs a friend in Mark, even if she doesn&amp;rsquo;t realize it&amp;mdash;and after Priscilla&amp;rsquo;s father and the bishop catch her and Mark in a compromising situation, their relationship becomes more complicated than ever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As affection quietly grows between them, Priscilla struggles to open her heart and reveal the painful secrets of her past. As Mark works to earn her good faith, can they both learn the hard lessons of love and trust? And can two friends discover a happiness that only God himself could have designed?
