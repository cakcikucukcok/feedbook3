  <title>Lumby on the Air - Gail Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;2017 Edition! &amp;nbsp;Book #5 of the Lumby series. What Garrison Keillor did for Lake Wobegon and Jan Karon did for Mitford, Gail Fraser has done for Lumby - a town so heartwarming and endearing, you&amp;#39;ll be forever transported. When Pam and Mark Walker&amp;rsquo;s relatives descend on Montis Inn for a week of vacation and an anniversary celebration, surprises abound that make this family reunion one that will never be forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Mark&amp;rsquo;s brother-in-law begins to broadcast his radio talk show from the inn&amp;rsquo;s living room, other family members are more interested in the festivities at the county fair. But it&amp;rsquo;s not just the antique Ferris wheel that comes to a jolting stop when Carter Reed turns up the volume of his commentaries on small town living and takes the side of a real estate developer who&amp;rsquo;s banking on turning Lumby into the next Aspen, and pits neighbor against neighbor while threatening the town&amp;rsquo;s bucolic way of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Pam juggles the generation gap between her thrill-seeking mother and a nonconformist niece who posts every detail of the clan&amp;rsquo;s get-together on Facebook. But for this one week, family, no matter how it&amp;rsquo;s defined, is always a matter of the heart and a spirit that defines the town everyone has come to know and love - Lumby.&lt;/p&gt;" />
