  <title>The Christmas Secret - Donna VanLiere</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a struggling young single mother saves the life of an elderly woman, she sets into motion a series of events that will test her strength, loyalty, and determination, all the while setting her on the path to finding true love. Christine Eisley is the mother of seven-year-old Zach and five-year-old Haley. Her ex-husband provides little, if any, child support and makes life difficult for Christine by using the children as pawns. She works long hours as a waitress to make ends meet, but her job is in jeopardy because she&#39;s often late to work due to the unreliable teenaged sitters she&#39;s forced to use. When Christine saves the life of a woman who works in Wilson&#39;s department store, the owner of Wilson&#39;s wants to find her, to thank her, but Christine has disappeared, losing another job once again. He sets his grandson, Jason, to the task of finding the mysterious &quot;Christy.&quot; Jason, an accountant by trade who has lost his job to downsizing, thinks he is &quot;above&quot; working at Wilson&#39;s. Soon, he discovers that this new task gives him more than he bargains for. &lt;i&gt;The Christmas Secret &lt;/i&gt;is a novel for anyone who wants to see how love is a gift that keeps giving back; that hope is a treasure that never runs dry, and that faith is a miracle that is reborn with each new day. &lt;br&gt;The Christmas Secret is now a Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries original film. Watch it this holiday season!&lt;/p&gt;" />
