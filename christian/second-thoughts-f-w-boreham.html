  <title>Second Thoughts - F. W. Boreham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book brings five previously published essays together for the first time. F. W. Boreham discusses five well-known second themes&amp;mdash;Second-Hand Things, The Second Crop, Second Fiddles, Our Second Wind and Second Thoughts. It is usual to regard anything that is second as being inferior in quality to the first. However, just as we may speak positively about something that is second nature to convey the idea of being completely natural and instinctive, and at the meal table we appreciate the invitation to have a second helping, so F. W. Boreham takes several second statements and helps us to see their profound worth. &amp;mdash;Dr. Geoff Pound&lt;/p&gt;" />
