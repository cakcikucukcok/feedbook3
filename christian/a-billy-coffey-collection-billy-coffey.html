  <title>A Billy Coffey Collection - Billy Coffey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now available in one volume&amp;mdash;three novels from Billy Coffey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Mockingbirds Sing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What marks the boundary between a miracle from God and the imagination of a child?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah is a child from Away, isolated from her peers because of her stutter. But then she begins painting scenes that are epic in scope, brilliant in detail, and suffused with rich, prophetic imagery. When the event foreshadowed in the first painting dramatically comes true, the town of Mattingly takes notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leah attributes her ability to foretell the future to an invisible friend she calls the Rainbow Man. Some of the townsfolk are enchanted with her. Others fear her. But there is one thing they all agree on&amp;mdash;there is no such thing as the Rainbow Man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then a dramatic and tragic turn of events leaves the town reeling and places everyone&amp;rsquo;s lives in danger. Now the people of Mattingly face a single choice:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will they cling to what they know . . . or embrace the things Leah believes in that cannot be seen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Devil Walks in Mattingly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the three people tortured by their secret complicity in a young man&#39;s untimely death, redemption is what they most long for . . . and the last thing they expect to receive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been twenty years since Philip McBride&#39;s body was found along the riverbank in the dark woods known as Happy Hollow. His death was ruled a suicide. But three people have carried the truth ever since&amp;mdash;Philip didn&#39;t kill himself that day. He was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet what cannot be laid to rest is bound to rise&amp;nbsp;again. These three will be drawn together for a final confrontation between life and death . . . between truth and lies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;In the Heart of the Dark Wood&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A motherless girl hungry for hope . . . and the dream that could be leading her astray.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost two years have passed since twelve-year-old Allie Granderson&amp;rsquo;s beloved mother, Mary, disappeared into the wild tornado winds. Her body has never been found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, Allie and her best friend Zach leave the city behind and push into the inky forest on the outskirts of Mattingly. For Allie, the journey is more than a ghost hunt: she is rejoining the mother she lost&amp;mdash;and finding herself with each step deeper into the heart of the dark wood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brimming with lyrical prose and unexpected discoveries,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;In the Heart of the Dark Wood&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;illustrates the steep transition we all must undergo&amp;mdash;the moment we shed our childlike selves and step into the strange territory of adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;" />
