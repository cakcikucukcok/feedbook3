  <title>Daniel and the Sun Sword - Nathan Lumbatis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thirteen-year-old Daniel is about to be adopted. But when he learns his new family wants him as a slave, he runs away with the help of his new neighbors, the na&amp;iuml;ve and cowardly Ben, and Raylin, a mysterious girl with a shady past. He begins to second-guess his decision when the cave they hide in transports them to the ruins of Machu Picchu, where they find themselves embroiled in a battle between ancient gods of Life and Death. To top things off, the God of Life draws Daniel into the fray by adopting him as his son and setting him on a quest to complete a broken, mystical sword, a task that will pit him against the god of the underworld. Now, Daniel and his friends have just one weekend to find the shards before a horde of supernatural enemies catch up. But that&amp;#39;s not all they face. A trap has been set that even Daniel wouldn&amp;#39;t expect, and he just took the bait. Will the power of his Heavenly Father be enough to save them? This Christian fantasy novel for young adults is the first in the Sons and Daughters series by Nathan Lumbatis. It is followed by the second novel in this series, Daniel and the Triune Quest." />
