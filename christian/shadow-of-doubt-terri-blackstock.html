  <title>Shadow of Doubt - Terri Blackstock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A poisoned past. A bitter present. Is Celia a murderer &amp;hellip; or a victim? Detective Stan Shepherd lies comatose in the hospital, a victim of arsenic poisoning. The Newpointe police have a suspect: Celia Shepherd, Stan&amp;rsquo;s wife. Celia is no stranger to such charges. When her first husband died of poisoning, a technicality scuttled the case against her and Celia got of scot-free. Now it looks like the same old story&amp;mdash;only this time, the motive appears plain. An old flame has moved into town under circumstances bound to raise suspicion. And that&amp;rsquo;s just for starters. More evidence is gathering that can put Celia away for good. But attorney Jill Clark thinks the pieces of the puzzle fit together a bit too neatly. Either her client&amp;rsquo;s Christian faith is a sham or she&amp;rsquo;s the victim of a deadly frame-up&amp;mdash;and the real killer is still afoot &amp;hellip; Shadow of Doubt is book two in the Newpointe 911 series by award-winning novelist Terri Blackstock. Newpointe 911 offers taut, superbly crafted novels of faith, fear, and close-knit small-town relationships, seasoned with romance and tempered by insights into the nature of relationships, redemption, and the human heart. Look also for Private Justice, Line of Duty, Word of Honor, and Trial by Fire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
