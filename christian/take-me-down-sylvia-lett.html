  <title>Take Me Down - Sylvia Lett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;They&#39;d risk their lives for love--and they may have to.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With a young daughter to raise and multi-million dollar hotel chain to run, the last thing Stephanie Mason wants is a relationship. But she&#39;s looking for a man--to keep her hotel safe. Enter Jack Kaufman. Ex-Navy Seal, former mercenary, and security specialist, not to mention dangerous and pulsing with raw sexuality, Jack is exactly what Stephanie needs--and everything she doesn&#39;t. Yet after a game of cat and mouse too seductive to resist, Jack charms his way into Stephanie&#39;s bed--and her heart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Stephanie isn&#39;t the only thing Jack is after. He wants something priceless to them both: Christina, Stephanie&#39;s adopted daughter--and, as fate would have it, Jack&#39;s biological child. It&#39;s a truth that unleashes a chain of threatening events even Jack may not be able to stop. If he doesn&#39;t act quickly, he may lose everything, and everyone, he&#39;s been fighting for all along.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Sylvia Lett&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Sylvia Lett is a magician at creating heroes to die for.&quot; --Evelyn Palfrey&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;With &lt;i&gt;Perfect for You,&lt;/i&gt; Sylvia Lett offers a story of sizzling romance and dramatic suspense.
