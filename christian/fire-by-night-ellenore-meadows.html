  <title>Fire by Night - Ellenore Meadows</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Forbidden friends since childhood, Tafne is a rich Egyptian noble and Eve is a Hebrew slave. When Eve is compelled to run away from slavery, Tafne offers her the perfect escapea new identity as an Egyptian. For three years their plan succeeds, but when the infamous traitor Moses unexpectedly returns in the name of Yahweh, the ancient God of Israel, their careful charade becomes gravely threatened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Moses demands freedom for the Israelite people, Pharaoh continually denies them, setting off a series of inexplicable disasters that ravage Egypt and humiliate its gods. As Tafne is drawn to this foreign God and His promises, Eve remains desperate to avoid the Hebrew people at all costs. The two are soon faced not only with a life apart from each other, but a world in which even the darkest secrets are brought to light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From beginning to end, Fire by Night illustrates Gods unmovable sovereignty, his fierce jealousy over our hearts, and his longing to redeem and cleanse to the uttermost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
