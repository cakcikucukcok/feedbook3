  <title>“Ride, Cowboy, Ride” - Gordon B. Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A story based on a historical event...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The west has been a lifelong interest of the author, as the den in his home gives ample evidence. A graduate of Butler University in Indianapolis, Gordon spent four years in the Air Force. While stationed at Greenville AFB in Mississippi, God made a huge change in his life. He has authored four books for family and friends, but &quot;Ride, Cowboy, Ride&quot; is his first formal publication.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The discovery of gold in California in 1848 increased the need for quicker communication between the two coasts. Trains got the mail from New York and Washington, DC to St. Joseph, Missouri okay, but slow stagecoaches then took a long southern route to California.
Three investors began the Pony Express -- a series of relay riders on horseback carrying the mail non-stop the nineteen-hundred miles from St. Joseph, Missouri to Sacramento, California in only ten days! In &quot;Ride, Cowboy, Ride&quot;, Tad Rawlings pursues the love of a pretty seamstress amid threats and a showdown with the meanest guy in town. As the first rider on the Pony Express, Tad relied on God when encountering life-threatening situations with bandits and Indians on &quot;the trail.&quot; Upon his return home, he found a truly surprising development.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Where do I begin? Beautiful, intimate. Great insight into history as well as life and spiritual matters. The author amazes me with his ability to spin a tale. God has certainly &quot;gifted&quot; the author with a talent few people have. Quite a &quot;wordsmith&quot;. Just remarkable. A book that demands a &quot;re-read&quot; just for the joy of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
