  <title>The White Room of Darkness - Lorne Spencer Hrabia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bart Woodsworth is a rich young man with a chip on his shoulder against his father, which fuels his wild lifestyle choices. His brother Franklin left home right out of high school, which only leaves himself, his sister Caroline and his parents to uphold the family name. From wild car rides to inventions that satisfy the materialist desires of mankind, you will be riveted to the ongoing action, adventure and love stories of a rich familys struggle to maintain an acceptable balance between love and hate! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White Room of Darkness is a fictional work that deals with the question of who God is to us and what we are to Him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earnest Bartholomew Woodsworth, was a man on a mission and always had an eye out for something new and innovative in the line of manufacturing or electronics. He always had to be the first one to have something new. When they first were released, he was the one to own a Polaroid camera, a video camera, a new remote car starter and even a new computer. This motivation eventually led him to Thomas Hillman, his best friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From wild stories of angelic encounters, a secret vault room, love encounters between believers and unbelievable games of sport, you will find yourself relating to at least one of the books characters and their hopes and dreams for the future!&lt;/p&gt;" />
