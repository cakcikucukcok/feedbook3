  <title>The Lustful Youth of Rodrigo Borgia - Michela Martignoni, Elena Martignoni, Lori Hetherington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rodrigo Borgia is destined to become Pope Alexander VI, one of the most powerful and corrupt men of the 15th century, but what of his youth?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Called to Rome with his brother at seventeen, the hot-blooded Spaniard seeks lessons in love from noblewomen and prostitutes, and wealth and power through collusion with cardinals, prelates, and the Roman nobility. He is driven, self-possessed, and carnal to the extreme.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a cardinal&amp;rsquo;s hat and two decades in the Eternal City, he enters an artisan&amp;rsquo;s workshop and a painter&amp;rsquo;s model wipes all thoughts from his mind. Soft shoulders, creamy skin&amp;hellip; and when her eyes stop on his, he feels his heart quake; her melodious voice and graceful turn of a hand ignite desire. Marriage to another man poses no obstacle to Rodrigo and they become lovers, sharing passion and pleasure to the point of intoxication.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surrendering to love is not a Borgia trait. Panic-stricken by the intensity of his feelings, Rodrigo flees from Rome and the object of his obsession, only to discover that Vannozza is the love of his life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Italian authors Elena and Michela Martignoni offer a new perspective on this famous Renaissance lover in their sophisticated, first-person account of the sensual man and the workings of his mind." />
