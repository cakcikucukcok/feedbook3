  <title>The Alexia Lindale Collection - Robert Whitlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Christy-award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;The List&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Trial&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Sacrifice&lt;/em&gt; comes two twisting tales of tough decisions, mixed motives, and mysterious, healing grace.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life Support&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexia Lindale knows her new case is a matter of life and death. She doesn&#39;t have a clue what it will do to her heart . . . and soul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baxter Richardson survived a fall from a cliff while hiding in the mountains. Whether he&#39;ll make it through the next few weeks is unclear. His survival depends on the machines that help him breathe. On the haunted, unstable wife who wants to pull the plug and hide her secrets. On the doting father who wants him alive for reasons of love and money. On the conflicting legal documents that send the fight to court. And, on the music and prayers of an extraordinarily gifted pianist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Everlasting&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With her client&#39;s husband somewhere between this world and the next, attorney Alexia Lindale makes an everlasting choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youngest son of a family consumed by greed, Baxter Richardson lingers on this earth in a coma. His wife wants him dead to protect her secrets. His brother wants him dead&amp;nbsp;to gain control of the family empire. And though Baxter&#39;s father fights to keep him alive, even he has ulterior motives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Baxter has a surprising ally. A classically trained pianist, Ted Morgan believes music can be used as prayer. And Ted&#39;s divinely-inspired playing has been slowly pulling Baxter back from the brink of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorney Alexia Lindale represents Baxter&#39;s wife, Rena, but has no idea that she and her client are being played in a game that has higher stakes than a single legal case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stronger Baxter grows, the more endangered he becomes. As Alexia navigates her responsibilities to her client, her relationship with the gifted musician, and her new relationship with God, she must discern the truth as it pertains to life, death, and life everlasting.&lt;/p&gt;" />
