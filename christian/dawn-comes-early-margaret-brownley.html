  <title>Dawn Comes Early - Margaret Brownley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Looking for a woman of good character and pleasant disposition willing to learn the ranching business in Arizona territory. Must be SINGLE and prepared to remain so now and forever more. Will be given ownership of ranch. &amp;ugrave;Eleanor Walker&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disgraced dime novelist Kate Tenney fled the city that banned her latest book for a fresh start at a cattle ranch in the Arizona Territory. She hopes ranching turns out to be as romantic as she portrayed it in her novels.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But what awaits her is a much harder life. There is no room for mistakes on a working cattle ranch in 1895, and Kate is ill-prepared for her new life. She quickly learns that dawn comes early . . . every day. But she is tenacious.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Having been abandoned by a string of men, Kate has no intention of ever marrying. But she didn&amp;AElig;t expect to meet Luke Adams either. Luke awakens feelings inside Kate she doesn&amp;AElig;t recognize, and his steady presence is a constant distraction. She has only written about love in the past, never known it herself. But her feelings for Luke stand in the way of all she has to gain if she is chosen as the heir.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Perhaps God brought Kate to the barrenness of the desert to give new life to her jaded heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
