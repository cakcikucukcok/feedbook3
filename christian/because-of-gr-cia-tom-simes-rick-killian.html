  <title>Because of Grácia - Tom Simes, Rick Killian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chase Morgan would love to live up to his name and pursue something great. It&amp;#39;s his senior year and he&amp;rsquo;s still as insecure as ever, but Eastglenn High&amp;#39;s newest student is about to turn that around. Gr&amp;aacute;cia is a girl with charisma, intelligence and conviction, but she&amp;rsquo;s not as &amp;ldquo;together&amp;rdquo; as Chase and his best friend OB might think. A dark past gives her a unique connection with Bobbi, a misunderstood classmate with a strained home life and an all-too-cute boyfriend as her means of escape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bobbi struggles with a life-and-death decision and Chase risks rejection, Gr&amp;aacute;cia challenges her friends, teachers and even herself to experience the transformative power of grace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the award-winning film starring Moriah Peters and Chris Massoglia, Because of Gr&amp;aacute;cia follows the stories of Chase Morgan, Gr&amp;aacute;cia Davis, and their fellow high school seniors as they face life-altering decisions on their journeys of faith, friendship, and love.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
