  <title>Golden Years - Andrew M. Greeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Father Andrew M. Greeley, one of America&#39;s most popular and trusted storytellers, has long charmed readers with his continuing chronicles of the crazy O&#39;Malleys, an irrepressible and resilient Irish American family caught up in the rush of modern American history. The previous novels in the O&#39;Malley saga, including &lt;i&gt;A Midwinter&#39;s Tale&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Second Spring&lt;/i&gt;, have taken the longtime Chicago residents from the early postwar era through the turmoil and malaise of the 1970s. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Golden Years&lt;/i&gt;, Chucky O&#39;Malley and his ever-growing clan enter the Reagan years---even as a series of painful shocks tests the family&#39;s strength as never before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The death of Chucky&#39;s elderly father brings the entire brood together to mourn, but what should be a time of unity is disrupted by the increasingly erratic behavior of Chucky&#39;s unhappy and emotionally unstable older sister, igniting a family crisis that ultimately threatens the lives of both young and old O&#39;Malleys. Furthermore, as if their own struggles are not enough to cope with, Chucky and his wife, Rosemarie, also find themselves called upon to help an old high school friend whose beloved wife and daughter have disappeared inexplicably. To find Brigid &quot;Bride&quot; O&#39;Brien and her innocent child, Chucky and Rosemarie must untangle a shadowy mystery that stretches from the bogs of Old Erin to the darkest chapters of the cold war. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will hard days ahead but, with love and more than a bit of faith, the O&#39;Malleys will bury their dead, dry their tears, and try to make the best of their . . . &lt;i&gt;Golden Years.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
