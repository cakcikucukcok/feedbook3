  <title>The Homeplace - Gilbert Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lanie took out her journal and dated it April 12, 1928. She started the habit of writing down everything that happened to her when she was no more than eight years old, and now she had six journals completely full. She thought about the prize at school, almost prayed to win, but somehow she could not. &amp;ldquo;God,&amp;rdquo; she finally said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll do my best, and if you&amp;rsquo;ll help me, that&amp;rsquo;s all I ask.&amp;rdquo; Fourteen-year-old Lanie Belle Freeman of Fairhope, Arkansas, has high hopes for her future. Happy on the five-acre family homeplace, she dreams of going to college and becoming a writer. And with her father launching a new business and her mother expecting the fifth baby, the bright days of an early Southern spring seem to herald expansive new beginnings for the Freeman family. But her mother isn&amp;rsquo;t as strong as she should be, and it&amp;rsquo;s going to take time for the business to pay back the mortgage. When unexpected tragedy strikes, it is left to Lanie to keep the family together and hold on to their home. In a world shaken by the Great Depression, it is faith in God and love in a tightly knit family that will help Lanie and her siblings overcome the odds and create a future that promises the fulfillment of love. The Homeplace offers a warmhearted and inspiring saga of a courageous young woman who holds her family together through the Depression era.&lt;/p&gt;" />
