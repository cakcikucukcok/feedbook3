  <title>House of Mercy - Erin Healy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;When Beth’s world falls apart, can she ever be whole again?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Beth has a gift of healing—which is why she wants to become a vet and help her family run their fifth-generation cattle ranch. Her father’s dream of helping men in trouble and giving them a second chance is her dream too. But it only takes one foolish decision for Beth to destroy it all.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Beth scrambles to redeem her mistake, pleading with God for help, even as a mystery complicates her life. The repercussions grow more unbearable—a lawsuit, a death, a divided family, and the looming loss of everything she cares about. Beth’s only hope is to find the grandfather she never knew and beg for his help. Confused, grieving, and determined to make amends, she embarks on a horseback journey across the mountains, guided by a wild, unpredictable wolf who may or may not be real.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Set in the stunningly rugged terrain of Southern Colorado,&amp;nbsp;&lt;I&gt;House of Mercy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/I&gt;follows Beth through the valley of the shadow of death into the unfathomable miracles of God’s goodness and mercy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“Healy has proven she has what it takes to write a fast paced supernatural thriller guaranteed to keep you hooked right until the last page, and beyond.” —TitleTrakk.com&lt;/P&gt;" />
