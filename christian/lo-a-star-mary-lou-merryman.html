      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone knows the story of Christmas. But how much do we know about Mary? What must she have felt, thought, dreamed or imagined when she was chosen by God to bear His Son?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lo, a Star&lt;/i&gt; chronicles nine months in the life of the special young woman who would become the Mother of Jesus.
