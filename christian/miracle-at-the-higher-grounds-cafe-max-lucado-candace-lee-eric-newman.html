  <title>Miracle at the Higher Grounds Cafe - Max Lucado, Candace Lee, Eric Newman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What if you could ask God anything? What would you ask? And how would He answer?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chelsea Chambers is on her own. After a public split from her NFL superstar husband, Chelsea takes a bold step out of the limelight and behind the counter of the Higher Grounds Caf&amp;eacute;, an old-fashioned coffee shop in dire need of reinvention. But when her courage, expert planning, and out-of-this-world cupcakes fail to pay the bills, this newly single mom finds herself desperate for help. Better yet, a miracle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then a curious stranger lands at Chelsea&amp;rsquo;s door, and with him, an even more curious string of events. Soon, customers are flocking to the Higher Grounds Caf&amp;eacute;, and not just for the cupcakes and cappuccino. They&amp;rsquo;ve come for the internet connection to the divine. Now the caf&amp;eacute; has become the go-to place for people in search of answers to life&amp;rsquo;s biggest questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a catastrophe strikes and her ex comes calling, Chelsea begins to wonder if the whole universe is conspiring against her quest to make it on her own. After a shocking discovery opens her eyes to the unseen world around her, Chelsea finds the courage to ask God a question of her own. Heaven answers in a most unexpected way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
