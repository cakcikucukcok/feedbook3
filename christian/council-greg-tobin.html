  <title>Council - Greg Tobin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this powerful sequel to Conclave, the acclaimed novel of the papacy, you will enter the shadowy corridors of the Vatican with the pope himself and go behind the scenes of the debates and intrigues that affect the lives of one billion Catholics around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Council&lt;/i&gt; is the riveting story of the first American-born pope, who sends shock waves throughout the Catholic Church when he summons a new ecumenical council, or gathering of the world&#39;s bishops - the first since the revolutionary Vatican II in the 1960s. His mission: to bring crucial, long-needed changes to the life of the Church he loves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Council&lt;/i&gt; is the passionate story of the men and women who are drawn into the maelstrom of faith and politics, passion and power. The pope who faces the most difficult crisis of his life . . . a beautiful journalist who loves a priest . . . a powerful Irish cardinal who bitterly opposes the pope&#39;s call for a council . . . a South American businessman who once served in a death squad . . . an American priest who is torn from his troubled parish to play a role in the pope&#39;s dream . . . all are front line soldiers in the battle of good against evil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Council&lt;/i&gt; is the intimate, detailed look at the daily life and the crushing responsibilities of the papacy, as conflict and conspiracies whirl around the controversial figure of Celestine VI, the surprise choice of the cardinals in the aftermath of a terrorist assassination of a beloved pope. Told with authority and sensitivity, insight and knowledge, Council is a story you&#39;ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
