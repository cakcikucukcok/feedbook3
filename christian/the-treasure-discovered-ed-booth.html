  <title>The Treasure Discovered - Ed Booth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Christian listened, he was again taken aback by Michaels response to the man who, for more than twenty-five years, had tried having him destroyed. Livid with anger, Christian shouted out, Kill him! Why spare one who is a minion of Satan? Send him into the abyss to join with his companions!
With a look of irritation, Michael replied, For one, I did not send the beasts into the abyss. I do not have the power to do so. And two, who are you or I to pass judgment upon a man? And yes, he is a man, a deceived man. The Word of God has a plan for Damon Weirguld, and his plan for him must play itself out!
Christian shrunk back after Michaels rebuke, though in his heart, he was not sure he was satisfied with Michaels answer. Christians thoughts went back, and he rehashed all the evil that Damon had perpetrated upon him for the last twenty-five years. Even now, the mans hatred for Christian was evidenced by his attack.
Knowing what Christian was thinking, Michael responded, Yes, he has, but Damon was created to do just as he has done. If not for his actions, the Word of God would not be where it is today. It is just as the religious leaders during the time of Jesus. They performed just as the Word of God knew they would. They demanded that Jesus be sent to the cross. What appears to be evil in your eyes does not mean that God needs your approval to carry out his plans. Sometimes, it is the very things we strive against that God uses to advance his Word!" />
