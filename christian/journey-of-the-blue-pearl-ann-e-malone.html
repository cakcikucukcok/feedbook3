  <title>Journey of the Blue Pearl - Ann E. Malone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Centurion Adas Longinus was the soldier assigned to execute two thieves and Jesus of Nazareth. Adas had no idea that the task would catapult him into a whirlwind of events that would change the course of his life and history. As he struggles to accept Jesus forgiveness, he must confront the mysterious and deadly vendetta his commanding officer, Centurion Valentius, holds against him. Adas also fears for those he loves, including Dulcibella, the beautiful and brave daughter of Cornelius, Adas former commanding officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout these events, Adas guards a unique pearl, the most highly prized gem of the ancient world, given to him by a dying man in gratitude for Adas act of courage and kindness. Will Adas survive long enough to understand the message of the pearl? Will he learn where the ethereal pearl came from and where it should go next? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel is based on some of the people and events described in the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles in the Bible. This is a storytellers tapestry woven with threads of history and colored with hues of imagination to portray the dramatic struggle of good against evil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
