  <title>The Stranger - Eleanor Lee Gustaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Romance and intrigue follow police officers, Detectives, Thea and Gene Ashton, where they discover God&#39;s amazing plan for their lives unfolding through the years and are led to redefine their calling when they&#39;re confronted by a near-death tragedy that almost takes them down. But, rewriting the journey of their lives in an unexpectedly profound way, the very heart of God&#39;s Plan impacts their work to greater value than they could have ever imagined.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Even resigning from the Force, eventually weaves in the threaded blessings of all God has as they completely surrender their wills to His, yielding to His Perfect Plan.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Coming full-circle, a beautiful pattern emerges to the joy in leading many to Christ where the very root of that tragedy holds untold blessings.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Ashtons come to terms that not all who hear the message of the Good News will say, yes, to Christ. It&#39;s a bittersweet joy when the wife of an unbelieving husband accepts the love Christ offers, surrendering her life shortly before she dies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Always ready to share the Hope with others that embraces God&#39;s awesome love, called to living the sozo life Christ came to bring, Thea and Gene give thanks for everything they have accomplished In His Name.&lt;/p&gt;" />
