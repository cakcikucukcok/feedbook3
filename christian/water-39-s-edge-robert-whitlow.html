  <title>Water&#39;s Edge - Robert Whitlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sometimes small towns hold the biggest secrets.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ambitious young attorney Tom Crane is about to become a partner in a high-profile Atlanta law firm. But first he must clear one final matter from his docket—the closing of his deceased father&#39;s law practice in his hometown of Bethel, Georgia. Killed in a mysterious boating accident, John Crane didn&#39;t appear to leave his son anything except the hassle of wrapping up loose ends.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;But instead of celebrating his promotion, Tom finds himself packing up his office, having suddenly been &quot;consolidated.&quot; To add insult to injury, that same night his girlfriend breaks up with him . . . by letter.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Returning to Bethel with no sense of his future and no faith to fall back on, Tom just wants to settle his father&#39;s final affairs and get&amp;nbsp;back to Atlanta. But then he runs into an unexpected roadblock—two million dollars of unclaimed money stashed in a secret bank account. And evidence that his father&#39;s death may not have been accidental. Worse still, a trail of data suggests his father played a role in an international fraud operation.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Tom follows the money into a tangled web of lies, theft, and betrayal. Along the way, he meets a woman who is as beguiling as she is beautiful. And her interest in the outcome of the case is just as high as his. She challenges Tom&#39;s assumptions . . . and his faith. Now he has to decide who he can trust—and how far a father&#39;s love can reach.&lt;/P&gt;" />
