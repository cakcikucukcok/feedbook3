  <title>The Confession - Robert Whitlow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Fans of John Grisham will find much to like here.&quot; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;Library Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Confession is good for the soul, but it could mean death to an ambitious young lawyer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant DA Holt Douglas has made a career of getting confessions from criminals. With a confession in hand, he knows a guilty plea is soon to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the midst of professional success, Holt is haunted by a secret&amp;mdash;a lie he buried in the grave of his best friend. Holt&amp;rsquo;s crime is hidden from all eyes&amp;mdash;family, friends, police, and his soon-to-be fianc&amp;eacute;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the truth has a way of coming back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With obsessive prosecutorial zeal, Holt reopens a cold case involving the death of the town&amp;rsquo;s wealthiest citizen. The man&amp;rsquo;s death was ruled a suicide, but Holt suspects murder. Facing fierce opposition, he is determined to expose the killer. Holt slowly begins to unravel the facts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And comes face-to-face with his own guilty conscience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his job, his relationship with the woman he loves, and his future at risk, Holt skirts the boundary between truth and lies, confession&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and hypocrisy, redemption and ruin. Can he survive long enough to finally make the right choice?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Readers will find plenty to love about this suspenseful novel as they watch its appealing main character juggle personal, professional, and spiritual crisis with a combination of vulnerability and strength.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;em&gt;CBA Retailers and Resources&lt;/em&gt;, regarding &lt;em&gt;The Living Room&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
