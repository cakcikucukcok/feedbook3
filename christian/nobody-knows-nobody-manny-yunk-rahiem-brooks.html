  <title>Nobody Knows Nobody - Manny Yunk, Rahiem Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO SILENCE YOU?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyris Bonds is Philadelphia&amp;#39;s newest problem. He doesn&amp;#39;t market his services, he doesn&amp;#39;t have an office, and he doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for anyone, but it doesn&amp;#39;t matter. His criminal record and years worth of street cred speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After serving time in prison, street thug&amp;mdash;sometimes robber, sometimes drug dealer, or both&amp;mdash;is on the loose. But instead of working his way to becoming a rich Philadelphian, he sets out to reclaim his spot and make his name ring even louder than it did in the past. With the help of some friend&amp;rsquo;s, he develops one of the biggest crime syndicates the city has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking on this roll is no easy feat, and there are opposing forces that keep guns blazing and the death toll rising. There is always a hefty price to pay, and before everyone goes to jail, Tyris has to use his all of his weapons to be sure Nobody Knows Nobody when the chips fall.&lt;/p&gt;" />
