  <title>Shadows on the Wall - Tommy E. Cauthen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jerry Stevenson had served in Berlin, Germany, for almost fifteen years and was considered to be an expert intelligence gatherer with excellent contacts in both East and West Germany. Yet he was haunted by a secret that he had discovered in the process of gathering intelligence in Berlin. Due to an accident occurring while extracting a source from East Germany, Jerry came face-to-face with his own conscience. Due to a loss of memory, he had become a CIA employee without realizing he had actually been trained as a Nazi saboteur, who was to land by U-boat in Florida in 1942. It was not until after the Wall went up that his secret web of deceit had been discovered yet forgiven. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile the Berlin Wall had divided the city from East to West, with effects even being felt around the world. This new physical and political situation diverted Jerrys activities to even more involvement with clandestine operations, involving himself in the delicate and secret exchange of prisoners, escape attempts, double agents, defections, and even an assassination attempt. This required even more skill, imagination, and courage than many exhibited. With his job, relationship with the love of his life, and his future at risk, Jerry skirts the boundaries between truth, lies, hypocrisy, and ruin. But can he survive long enough to make the right choices and decisions concerning his current operation?&lt;/p&gt;" />
