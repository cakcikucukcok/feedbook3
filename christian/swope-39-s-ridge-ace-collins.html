  <title>Swope&#39;s Ridge - Ace Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;September 12, 2001. Four members of the Klasser family are found dead outside Dallas, Texas. In the wake of 9/11, the Klassers&amp;rsquo; neighbor, Omar Jones&amp;mdash;an American citizen of Arab descent&amp;mdash;is convicted of their murder. A month before Jones&amp;rsquo; execution, attorney Lije Evans searches for evidence that will prove the man innocent. But Evans&amp;rsquo; quest goes deeper than solving one crime. He is determined to find the secret behind the dark history of sleepy Swope&amp;rsquo;s Ridge&amp;mdash;and how it ties into his wife&amp;rsquo;s murder. Interlocking mysteries lead Evans and his team to the battlegrounds of former Nazi Germany, the dirt roads of Kansas, and a rusty cargo ship in the Gulf of Mexico. Along the way, they discover a secret that offers the promise of great power&amp;mdash;and the greatest temptation they&amp;rsquo;ve ever faced. In the second book of the Lije Evans Mysteries series, bestselling author Ace Collins immerses readers in an intricate and deadly international plot. Racism, betrayal, and death-defying escapes compound an adventure that knows no bounds in this harrowing novel for suspense lovers everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;" />
