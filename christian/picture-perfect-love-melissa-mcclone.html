But her own heart is still broken, the unworn wedding dress hanging in her closet a reminder that relationships aren&#39;t always as perfect as they look through her camera lens.

Even if Jenna can forgive him, dare he hope for a second chance at her love?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
