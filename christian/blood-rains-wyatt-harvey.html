  <title>Blood Rains - Wyatt Harvey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the dead do not just whisper&amp;hellip;and sometimes it rains blood.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Your young men shall see visions, your old men shall dream dreams.&amp;rdquo; (Acts 2:17)&lt;br /&gt;
Mikhael &amp;ldquo;Mick&amp;rdquo; Priest is a private detective with an unearthly gift. It sets him apart from those around him and sometimes threatens his very sanity. Mick Priest sees and hears the dead, through waking visions and dreaming dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hers was the last face I would have expected to see again.&amp;rdquo; (Mick Priest)&lt;br /&gt;
A woman from his past has come to him and asked for help. A serial killer is stripping people of their lives in his old hometown and must be stopped. Mick Priest cannot find it in himself to say no&amp;hellip;as she is a victim herself, haunting his very dreams. As the storms rage in the historic, port city, battling the killing spree is not all he faces. He must face his own torn psyche, discovering another mystery lurking within the shadows of his own mind. As he&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;struggles to expose the truth, can he stop the carnage?&lt;br /&gt;
Can one man slow the blood rains?&lt;/p&gt;" />
