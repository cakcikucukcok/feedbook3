  <title>Turn Four - Zondervan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="”…Not only grabs a reader’s attention; he teaches all you need to know about the inner world of stock-car racing. This book will surprise you with a treasury of life lessons.”--Dale Beaver, Nextel Cup Chaplain, Motor Racing OutreachThe unthinkable has finally happened. Can Chance Reynolds face a life without racing?Before he even had his driver’s license, Chance Reynolds was racing—and winning. He worked his way up the racing ranks from go-carts to sprint cars to stock cars, exercising a natural talent that made him one of the best drivers in midwestern racing. Now he has captured the points lead in stock car racing’s premiere series, and is a favorite to win the championship . . .. . . Until an off-track accident shatters his career and his life.Riddled with doubts and questions, Chance delves into the Bible, looking for answers, a clear path for the next turn in his life. The thought of leaving the racing world is mind- numbing—it’s all he has ever known. Turn Four is an unforgettable ride through the realities of professional racing. Cloaked in the fanfare, it’s a life of seeming comfort and glory. But underneath it all, people are searching for meaning in life, for love, for God. Buckle up and hold on tight." />
