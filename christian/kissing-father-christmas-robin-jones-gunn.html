  <title>Kissing Father Christmas - Robin Jones Gunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;Bestselling, award-winning author Robin Jones Gunn welcomes us back to the cozy English village of Carlton Heath for a winter romance that will melt your heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anna&#39;s first visit to Carlton Heath in England was last May for the wedding of her cousin Ian to Miranda. The beautiful event ended with a dance under the stars and Anna receiving an unexpected kiss from Peter, the groomsman who caught her eye and now holds her heart.  &lt;div&gt;Now, at the invitation of family and friends, Anna is returning to Carlton Heath for Christmas. She has Peter&#39;s recent email to fill her with assurance that he&#39;s looking forward to seeing her again as well.  &lt;div&gt;More than his brief words, though, the vivid memory of their unforgettable kiss provides a promise of more to come. Anna, ever the imaginative artist, has been busy painting a romantic conclusion to her holiday visit. Certainly she&#39;s not the only one who has been dreaming of another dance and another kiss. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;But when she sees Peter again, his intentions seem to shift as speedily as the blustery winter weather. Is Anna&#39;s heart misleading her, or will Father Christmas bestow on her the gift of love for which she has long dreamed? &lt;/div&gt;" />
