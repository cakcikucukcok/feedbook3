  <title>Intervention - Terri Blackstock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Barbara Covington has one more chance to save her daughter from a devastating addiction: staging an intervention. But when eighteen-year-old Emily disappears on the way to drug treatment&amp;mdash;and her interventionist is found dead at the airport&amp;mdash;Barbara enters her darkest nightmare of all. Barbara and her son set out to find Emily before Detective Kent Harlan arrests her for a crime he is sure she committed. Fearing for Emily&amp;rsquo;s life, Barbara maintains her daughter&amp;rsquo;s innocence, but does she really know her anymore? Meanwhile, Kent has questions of his own. His gut tells him that this is a case of an addict killing for drugs. But as he gets to know Barbara, he begins to hope he&amp;rsquo;s wrong about Emily. Fear rises as the mysteries intensify: Did Emily&amp;rsquo;s obsession with drugs lead her to commit murder&amp;mdash;or is she another victim of a cold-blooded killer? In this gripping stand-alone novel of intrigue and suspense, bestselling fiction author Terri Blackstock delivers the up-all-night drama that readers around the world have come to expect from her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
