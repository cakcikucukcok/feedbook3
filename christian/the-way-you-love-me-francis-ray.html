      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nothing gets to Shane Elliott. A former Army Ranger, now head of security for a wealthy real estate tycoon, Shane can handle whatever life throws at him--until he meets the beautiful, kindhearted Paige Albright. She&#39;s about to inherit a fortune, and Paige&#39;s mother has asked Shane to investigate her boyfriend. It should have been a simple, standard assignment for Shane...if only Paige&#39;s seductive mix of strength and vulnerability didn&#39;t leave him wanting her for himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All her life, Paige has put others&#39; needs before her own, even going so far as choosing a man to please her father. Now her mother&#39;s mysterious houseguest is tempting her to go after what she truly wants...even if it&#39;s the cool, assertive, irresistible Shane himself. But is he who he appears to be? And how can Paige know whether to trust her own judgment--and their red-hot attraction?&lt;/p&gt;" />
