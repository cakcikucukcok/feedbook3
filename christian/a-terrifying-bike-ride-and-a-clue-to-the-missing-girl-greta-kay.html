  <title>A Terrifying Bike Ride and a Clue to the Missing Girl - Greta Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A story of intrigue, an unsolved mystery, a warning ignored--draws the reader into the lives of Becca Nelson and Leigh Wilcox, who stumble into the center of a dark plot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Think Tank Axis #1 an undercover organization bent on controlling the minds of teens? Do the points in the survey questions start them down a path of doubting their family life? Becca Nelson surmises this as fact. She confides her suspicion to Logan who listens, but is not alarmed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do your parents give you choices on everyday decisions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the culture of your parents old fashioned and irrelevant to teens of today? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you believe your parents are fair to you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would you like to plan your future without others opinions? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you tell your parents everything? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to keep myself out of trouble. I dont have a dad to defend me, one that will always take my side. And Mom wouldnt know what to do if she had to get me out of trouble. I cant waste my time on trying to be popular. I discarded that goal long ago. I saw what happens to those kids whose friends didnt know the definition of loyalty. Popularity is like a swinging door, in one day, out the next. Too many tears and heartbreaks for those once-upon-a-time popular kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their bike ride, the girls capture an injured magpie and nurse him back to health, eventually releasing him back to the wild, not realizing they would meet again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
