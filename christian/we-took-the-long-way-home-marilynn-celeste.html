  <title>We Took The Long Way Home - Marilynn Celeste</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An epic saga of friendship, family secrets, betrayal and coming of age in the aftermath of the 1967 Detroit riots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angelica Tanner learned as a child not to ask her mother too often about who her father might be. She pretends to be satisfied with the story of him being a war hero, dead and buried before he knew he was going to be a dad. But the stories don&amp;#39;t add up. Could it be he&amp;#39;s the most feared mobster in Detroit? Is that why &amp;quot;no decent colored man&amp;quot; would want her mother according to her grandmother?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ricky Williams is the college bound son of a large family, shouldering the burden of keeping his older brother out of trouble on the street. Will Ricky get out in time to save himself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Angelica and her best friend Ricky groove through the Summer of Love, their youthful adventures collide with the course of history, when their city and their lives change forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This tale follows Angelica and her friends into the 1980s to a world of unimaginable loss, redemption, love, and ultimately home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
