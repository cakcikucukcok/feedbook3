  <title>The Stone of Ebenezer - Susan Van Volkenburgh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;NAGAD&amp;#39s life was perfect until it was torn apart by the ravages of war. Now, haunted by his past, this young conscript must meet the enemy in battle. With shaking rage the nations collide in a fierce conflict for dominance. Yet more is at stake than the survival of a people. The dispute contests the claim of immortal supremacy, the outcome to prove whose god reigns omnipotent.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;And so, Nagad of Benjamin pushes on through the raging tide of battle. But to no avail. Soon crushed by the mighty war machine of Philistia, thousands of Hebrew soldiers lay slaughtered upon the carrion infested field. Hope has abandoned them. Then it is remembered, that in the days of their fathers, any army that bore the Ark of the Covenant could not be defeated. They need the Ark, for only then can the Chosen of God prevail against the enemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &amp;#34An amazing, vivid account of biblical events is historically accurate where God&amp;#39s judgments, treacherous journeys, blood battles and even romance come alive to the reader in this skillfully written epic story.&amp;#34 -Rev. Judith Wiegman&lt;/p&gt;" />
