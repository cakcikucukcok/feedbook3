  <title>Silver Springtime - Cecelia Hopkins-Drewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A novel of coming of age in the 1980s.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The agony of unrequited love, dates, dresses and exams all make life confusing during the teen years... Are there answers to be found in the social conventions of the previous generation, the developments of modern psychology taught in class, the theology touted at worship or in the depths of soul searching and personal experience?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This story belongs to the genre known as &amp;quot;Bildungsroman&amp;quot; or novel of development. It covers one very significant year in the life of a young female by the name of Stephanie Lowood, and is presented a diary, which was discovered in a chest by the heroine&amp;#39;s daughter and young grandchildren. The grandchildren are curious to hear how Grandma met Grandpa and what life was like in the 1980s!" />
