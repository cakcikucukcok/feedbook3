  <title>The Outlaw&#39;s Second Chance (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired Historical) - Angie Dicken</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;RENEGADE ON THE RUN&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Cort Stanton and Aubrey Huxley try to claim the same land in the Oklahoma Land Run, Cort offers a deal—one that could help him keep his freedom. Taking the blame for his brother’s crime, Cort needs to lie low, so he gives Aubrey the land for her horse ranch…if she’ll hire him. Now, he just has to avoid growing too close to the gorgeous seamstress who can never know his secret.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Aubrey refuses to depend on any man, even one as handsome and kind as Cort. Yet, as they work together to make her dream a reality, it’s impossible to imagine life on the prairie without him. And though Aubrey knows Cort has secrets that stand between them, she can’t help but wish she could stake a claim on his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
