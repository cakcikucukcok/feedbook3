Embezzled by the destructive abilities of a weapon of darkness which allured as a challenging match to the Diamond Arrow, one of the golden warriors is shaken to the core. As Silas and Lydia face the works of an infuriated dragon, a convincing witch and a tyrant with dozens of wicked minions under his command, will they lose their faith or come to realize that they are more than conquerors?
