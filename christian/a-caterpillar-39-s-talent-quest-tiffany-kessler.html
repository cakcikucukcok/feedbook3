  <title>A Caterpillar&#39;s Talent Quest - Tiffany Kessler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tiffany Kessler wrote this story when she was thirteen years old for a science project at the Roseleaf Academy in Farmville, North Carolina. Five months later she had a trampoline accident and broke her neck in two places. Emergency surgery was called for in order to save her from paralysis or possible death. Her surgeon put a plate and two screws in her neck and said she was a millimeter away from a complete catastrophe. Through the power of prayer, she felt the love of family, friends, and our heavenly Father and knew she was going to be okay. Recovery was difficult. She wore a neck brace twenty-four hours a day for four months. She was unable to participate in sports and had to work extremely hard to keep up in school. Her self-image and confidence made her wonder what her purpose was in life. Then she realized that publishing her story would be a way to encourage others to believe in themselves and not try to conform to fit in but to stay true to who they are in order to discover their gifts and talents. Tiffany resides in Greenville, North Carolina, and has been crowned Teen Ms. North Carolina 2015. She will be pursuing her dream of writing more books and working with others helping them discover their purpose in life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
