Being a criminal investigator, as well as a counterintelligence and counterterrorism specialist, gave him plenty of opportunities to put together characters that keep us guessing as we read.<br /><b><i>Child Finder: Mike Angley, Terri Mitchem, Jaquelynn ...</i></b> | Child Finder is one of the few general audience thrillers that would also appeal to religious readers and young adults. The lessons are subtle, but the moral choices are clear. Although Angley plays with traditional ideas, his approach is new and original. This novel received the MWSA 2009 Silver Medal for Fiction out of a very crowded field.<br /><b><i>Child Finder by Mike Angley - Goodreads</i></b> | “Child Finder is a gripping, intriguing, rare and accurate look into the U.S. Intelligence Community. Angley uses his long government career to weave a believable fiction tale that is as current as today’s news.
