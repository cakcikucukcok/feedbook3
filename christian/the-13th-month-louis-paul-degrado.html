  <title>The 13Th Month - Louis Paul DeGrado</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Evil once controlled the 13th month and wants to again. A holy man, a shaman, a psychiatrist, and a professor are on a mission: to fight parasitic creatures waiting inside moments of time to warp reality and take control of their host. As the group approaches a house in a quiet neighborhood, they suspect something evil is about to happen. Unfortunately it is too late by the time they enter. A teenager has already killed his parents and sister, thanks to an evil force that now controls him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Father Frank Keller is contacted by the group to help prevent the once banished shadows from gaining a foothold, he is thrust into a covert battle between forces of good and evil. The only way to stop the forces is to enter a portal where the shadows come from and turn the tide. As Father Keller struggles to find the faith to combat the evil and help the group, he has no idea that he is about to be led straight to the gates of hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 13th Month&lt;/i&gt; is the suspenseful tale of a priests courageous journey into a dark world where he sacrifices more than he ever imagines in an effort to stop evil forces before they strike again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
