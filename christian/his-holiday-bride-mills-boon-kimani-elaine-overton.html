          &lt;em&gt;Trouble was her middle name…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Of the four Lockharts, Amber was the wild child, a part-time student and full-time groupie who gave her older sisters sleepless nights. But even Amber was surprised when her pre-Christmas getaway turned nasty, causing her to flee from danger–right into the six-pack abs of Paul Gutierrez.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;His was danger…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Going home was not an option when Amber became the target of a man desperate to keep a secret. So Paul&#39;s L.A. home became her safe house, his strong arms her armor. After long nights with her macho protector, Amber was in danger all right–from a hot, sexy Latin lover!&lt;/p&gt;
