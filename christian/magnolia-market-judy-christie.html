  <title>Magnolia Market - Judy Christie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fresh starts aren&amp;rsquo;t nearly as glamorous as they appear. And love isn&amp;rsquo;t any easier the second time around.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Avery Broussard was savoring her long-dormant optimism. It was the first anniversary of her husband&amp;rsquo;s death, and she was fi nally going to buy the dress boutique from her former mother-in-law. After a year of saving, the deal was nearly done. Avery was about to get her life back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But every deal in Samford, Louisiana, can change at the whim of a Broussard. After being unceremoniously ejected from the very boutique she planned to buy&amp;mdash;the boutique she herself had rescued from ruin&amp;mdash;she becomes a woman without a future . . . suddenly at war with her late husband&amp;rsquo;s family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When carpenter T. J. Aillet begins working for the Broussards doing manual labor, he overhears enough to know that Avery is being victimized. Soon enough, T. J. is lassoed into the squabble by his family connections, his good heart . . . and the undeniable attraction he feels toward Avery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Aillets are no strangers to Samford society&amp;mdash;and T. J. knows what happens when you cross the Broussards. Could these two misfi ts ever make a start together? Or will the pressures of Samford society pull them apart before they even get a chance to try?&lt;/p&gt;" />
