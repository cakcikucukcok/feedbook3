  <title>In Search of a King - Rebecca R. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The story begins seven years after the conclusion of &amp;ldquo;DEATH HAS NO HOLD.&amp;rdquo; The Williams family has returned to Teylia Island to expose the truth of their late Queen&amp;#39;s evil reign and to bring the good news of Jesus Christ to the beloved islanders.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lucifer is in a vicious rage as he sees a great revival beginning to sweep the island he once claimed as his own. He had not expected such a crippling blow as this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Seeing the present queen, Natasha Jansson, diligently searching for the man she believes God has chosen to be her successor, Lucifer and his hordes move quickly with desperation and ferocity. He must see to it his own chosen one, chosen even before his birth, ascends to the throne of Teylia Island, before Queen Natasha can succeed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Seven years earlier, Lucifer attempted to destroy the very ones who are now stealing his domain. Now he will let nothing stop him from getting back what is his and making his tormentors suffer. He will have to use his skills of deception and illusion to the very best of his ability. He must use the best and most skilled of all of his host of darkness. He will mete out harsh and excruciating consequences upon any of his men who fail him in any way.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is war! There is only one hope. He must see his own man put on the throne of Teylia Island. There is no room for anything but victory.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;However, the Creator, God of Heaven and Earth, is unshaken by the efforts of the Prince of the Power of the Air, or of any man. He has his own will and His own purpose and His acts are magnificent to behold!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Find out what has happened in the lives of characters you have come to love, and become caught up in the suspense, the intrigue, and even the joy, of &amp;ldquo;In Search of a King.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
