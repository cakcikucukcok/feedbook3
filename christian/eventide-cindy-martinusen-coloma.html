  <title>Eventide - Cindy Martinusen Coloma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eventide: the time from when the sun begins to set until total darkness has descended.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was once of those magical seasons that lives forever in memory. An Italian seaside village. Days of adventure and romantic exploration. Moonlight swims in a sparkling sea. A once-in-a-lifetime love. And though it ended in heartbreak, though she moved on to marry happily and have a son, Carrie never quite put that summer behind her. Now she&#39;s dying young and still haunted by thoughts of her long-ago love. Her best friend Lauren, determined to put Carrie&#39;s mind at ease, sets out to do something completely foreign to her own cautious, conservative nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Out of love, Lauren will find and confront the man she despises, the man who broke her best friend&#39;s heart, the man who has spent the last twenty years running from his past. Out of love, she will journey alone to retrieve secrets left behind after that never-for-gotten summer. And somehow, she will set into motion events that change nothing . . . but transform everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the mysteries of twenty years unravel, as husband and son and friend and even a long-lost love converge to say goodbye, something unexpected unfolds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another seaside adventure. Another moonlight swim. And somethow, even at eventide, the miracle of enduring grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
