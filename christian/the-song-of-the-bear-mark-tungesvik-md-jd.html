  <title>The Song of the Bear - Mark Tungesvik Md Jd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all have a choice between living a meaningless life governed by space, time, and chance or entering into a poetic life where every moment is touched by the hand of God. Take a break from the plastic culture of our age and join John, a seventeenth-century farmer in the Black Forest of Germania as he is drawn into a quest to stop an evil plot thousands of years in the making. Follow John as he and his three young companions brave perilous threats from cursed beasts as old as mankind and an evil that has slumbered far longer. Learn to trust in the narrow path with John and his companions before it is too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The curse was not limited to a few weeds in the fields of men. There were things that were born into the world that day that live in the darkest places imaginable. They are monstrous and brutish with no reasoning capacity, only a lust to feed  to feed on us. A few men have fallen to these monsters, but men seldom tread in the darkest parts of the world. &lt;/p&gt;
