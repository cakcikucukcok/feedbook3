  <title>Oriel&#39;s Travels - Robert Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From fanatical destroyer of the followers of Jesus to fearless gospel pioneer - the incredible story of the man central to the formation of the Church!
Political wranglings at the highest level...personal animosities at the lowest...the mystery of how the church - &#39;the Boss&#39;s new family&#39; - was birthed in the midst of fierce earthly discords and intense spiritual battles is described through the travel diary of Archangel Oriel. Oriel&#39;s mission appears simple - to make sure one man, Paul, gets to Rome, taking the Good News of the resurrected Christ into the heart of the non-Jewish world. But Oriel&#39;s task is hindered by internal disagreements and external plots, forced flights and hair-raising escapes, shipwreck and imprisonment...not to mention his own deep fears of the sea and Paul&#39;s distrust of both horses and women!
In this fantastic sequel to the brilliant Oriel&#39;s Diary, Oriel&#39;s Travels tells the incredible story of Paul&#39;s epic journey to Rome from the perspective of an accompanying archangel. Oriel closely follows Paul in his adventures and ministry in the same way that he followed Jesus in the first Oriel story. In a humorous, entertaining and thought-provoking manner, Oriel takes readers behind the scenes of this well known Biblical account to provoke fresh appreciation for this central episode in God&#39;s plan of spreading the news of salvation." />
