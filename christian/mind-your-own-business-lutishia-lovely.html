      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A great new taste in the literary world.&quot; --Carl Weber&lt;P&gt;Lutishia Lovely dishes up a sizzling helping of love, lust, and temptation in this sexy, scandalous tale of a family and their soul food dynasty... &lt;P&gt;Life is sweet for the Livingstons. Their booming restaurant business, Taste of Soul, is launching a West Coast division, and Bianca Livingston and her brother, Jefferson, are vying to head it up. And while their cuisine may be spicy, their personal lives are even hotter.  .  .&lt;P&gt;Bianca recently completed a culinary course in Paris--along with a steamy love affair. So her parents&#39; insistence that she marry a man of their choosing only fuels her hunger for freedom and her thirst for success. Meanwhile, Jefferson wants to spend more time with his secret L.A. love--a relationship his family would never approve.

But Jefferson, Bianca, and others.  .  .wish everyone would mind their own business.  .  . &lt;P&gt; &quot;One big dramatic tale.&quot; --&lt;I&gt;RT Book Reviews&lt;/I&gt;" />
