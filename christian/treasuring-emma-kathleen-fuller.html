&lt;p&gt;Adam was her first love and best friend. But then he went away. Determined to experience the freedom of living in the &lt;em&gt;Englisch&lt;/em&gt; world, he left Emma heart-broken. How could he have chosen the world over her?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now Adam is back in Middlefield and Emma can&#39;t seem to keep him away from her family&#39;s farm. But this time she&#39;s determiend to guard her heart. It might be love that keeps him there . . . or perhaps just guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a newcomer arrives in town and shows an interest in Emma, she dismisses Adam&#39;s insistence that she be cautious. All this attention is new to her and she doesn&#39;t know quite how to accept it. Emma knows her Heavenly Father treasures her. But will her new beau?&lt;/p&gt;" />
