  <title>A Hand to Hold - Kathleen Fuller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruth Byler has never failed at anything in her life, but Zach Bender is going to test the&amp;nbsp;limits of her heart.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A student at heart, Ruth is finally a teacher at the Amish schoolhouse. But after her first day, she wonders if she&amp;rsquo;s made a mistake. The students want nothing to do with learning. Deflated, she makes a promise to herself to not give up&amp;mdash;not yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Zach comes to fix a repair at the schoolhouse, he notices the young Amish teacher and the disorderly students. After seeing enough, he storms into the classroom and demands the students show Ruth respect. Satisfied he&#39;s done a good deed, he waits around so Ruth can thank him. Instead she&#39;s furious he interfered. Zach leaves, thinking she&#39;s still the snobby, bookworm he knew from school.&amp;nbsp;He doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much use for learning. And now he has little use for Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s more to Zach&amp;rsquo;s story, and when Ruth finds out the truth to why&amp;nbsp;he hated school, the consequences leave them seeing each other in a different light. Ruth can help Zach if he&amp;rsquo;ll let her. But to do so, he&amp;rsquo;ll need to offer her his hand.&lt;/p&gt;" />
