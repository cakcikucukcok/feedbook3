  <title>Second Chance - Gary Vochatzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Second coming of Christ becomes a reality. This individual sees his error in not believing so does all he can to get God to give him a second chance. This is the story of a mans goal to reach into the heart of God proving he was ignorant and arrogant of such a great calling of God to be saved through faith in the Son of God, Jesus Christ. He attempts, even giving his own life, to see if his voice had been heard by God who created all that there is! Jesus Christs return may happen today or a thousand years from now, but God will bring it to pass, guaranteed!&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This book was written with one purpose in my mind-to scare, frighten the hell out of you for what you are about to read, but trust me His coming is as sure as the sun rising each day, and life and death. This book was written to keep your soul secure in heaven under the blood spilled for us by Jesus Christ.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Gary Vochatzer, Author&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bible clearly explains how people can be spiritually prepared for the events leading up to the Return of Christ  and for eternity.  People should live expecting His return in their lifetime. Gary vividly describes the anguish for a family  and their community  who were caught off guard. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Pastor Wayne Bibelheimer&lt;br&gt;
