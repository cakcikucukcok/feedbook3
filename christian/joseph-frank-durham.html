  <title>Joseph - Frank Durham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An event is about to take place that will change the world. God has chosen a young couple from Nazareth, who are betrothed, to be the parents of His son. Mary is obedient to Gods plan but Joseph is reluctant until an angel tells him to not be afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary has just given birth to the Son of God, and Joseph now holds this wet, slippery baby in his hands. What does he do now, as the animals in the stable make their presence known? He must of course complete the birthing process, but who is this child he holds? Is he a rabbi, a prophet  a king? Why did God ask him, a lowly carpenter, to be the surrogate father? What challenges lay ahead?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it will be his and Marys responsibility to raise this special child. After he hands the baby to Mary, who places him to her breast, Joseph gives her a lingering kiss and lies down beside her. Then they bask in the glory of the moment while outside, the little town of Bethlehem sleeps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the beginning of a loving relationship between Joseph and Jesus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
