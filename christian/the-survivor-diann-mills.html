  <title>The Survivor - DiAnn Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is it her next bestseller . . . Or her last words?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Chase&lt;/em&gt;, award-winning author DiAnn Mills introduced you to the world of Kariss Walker, the bestselling suspense author with a nose for trouble. In &lt;em&gt;The Survivor&lt;/em&gt;, Kariss gets the chance to tell her most powerful story yet. But will it revitalize her writing career? Or bring it to a violent end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kariss meets Dr. Amy Garrett, who survived a brutal childhood attack in which the assailant was never found. Now Dr. Garrett wants her story written in a novel. Kariss wishes she could seek the advice of Special Agent Tigo Harris, but she broke off the relationship a few months prior and seeing him again would be too painful. She interviews Amy and conducts her own research, stepping unaware into danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tigo misses Kariss and wants her back, but he understands why she broke off their relationship. Instead, he concentrates on solving a car bombing and bringing the killer to justice. As Kariss&amp;rsquo;s new story attracts an onslaught of danger that she never expected, can Tigo save the woman he loves and find out who wants her dead for writing about an unsolved cold case?&lt;/p&gt;" />
