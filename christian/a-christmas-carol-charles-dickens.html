  <title>A Christmas Carol -  Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Charles Dickens&amp;#39; work, &amp;#39;&amp;#39;A Christmas Carol&amp;#39;&amp;#39; (in full &amp;quot;A Christmas Carol, in Prose: Being a Ghost Story of Christmas&amp;quot;), originally published in 1843, is probably his most well-known and beloved piece. The story, suddenly conceived and written in a few weeks, is one of the outstanding Christmas stories of modern literature. Each year during the Christmas season, this famous story is revived once again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This short tale takes place on Christmas Eve when Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by three spirits. Scrooge&amp;#39;s name has become synonymous with not only greed but a hatred of Christmas cheer. He&amp;#39;s portrayed at the start of the show as a man who only cares for money. His business partner Jacob Marley died years earlier and the closest things to a friend he has is his employee Bob Cratchit. Even though his nephew invites him to Christmas dinner, Scrooge refuses, preferring to be alone. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
That night Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Marley who warns him that he will be visited by three spirits.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The first is the ghost of Christmas past who takes Scrooge on a journey through the Christmas&amp;#39;s of his childhood. Scrooge is reminded of how much fun he had during those years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The second spirit is the ghost of Christmas Present, who takes Scrooge on a tour of his nephew and Bob Cratchit&amp;#39;s holiday. We learn that Bob has a sickly son named Tiny Tim and that Scrooge pays him so little the Cratchit family lives in near poverty.&lt;br /&gt;
When the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come arrives things take a bleak turn. Scrooge is shown his lonely and miserable death so he changes his ways and becomes a charitable person." />
