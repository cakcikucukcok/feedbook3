  <title>Descent from White Mountains - Dale Pfeiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Pfeifferberg Chronicles: Book One: Descent from White Mountains is a glimpse into life in the days of Noah, before and after the Great Flood. Although sourced primarily from the Book of Genesis, the author offers an exciting and unique story-line by weaving ancient Celtic chronicles with elements of Caucasian tradition and archeological discoveries that have enlightened our historical perspective. Book One in the trilogy is the story of the adventurous life of Japheth, the Great Voice, and the historical progenitor of all Caucasian tribes, and about his seven magnificent sons: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras. These highly intelligent and fit ancients where in essence the greatest and purest of every Caucasian nation; we are the physical and existential sons and daughters of these super men. These titans were the &quot;wild at heart&quot; that John Eldredge wrote about. Curious readers will learn what occurred after Noah’s prayer of blessing over Japheth and the expansion of Japheth’s seed into all the coastal territories of the earth. Did you ever wonder what it was like in the days of Noah? Is there a longing for adventure in your heart? Could you be the chronicler for your posterity? Dr. Bill Cooper, After the Flood, writes, &quot;The Pfeifferberg Chronicles, I have no doubt, will often be imitated by future authors, and deservedly so. It has set an important benchmark.&quot; Descent from White Mountains will inspire you to take a long look at yourself, your ancestry, and perhaps, like Mr. Pfeiffer, your tribal genesis." />
