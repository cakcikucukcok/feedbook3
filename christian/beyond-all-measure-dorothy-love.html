  <title>Beyond All Measure - Dorothy Love</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Ada has loved deeply and lost dearly. But protecting her heart could mean missing the love of a lifetime.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Ada Wentworth may be young, but she&#39;s seen enough of life to know she can only rely on herself. Everyone including God it seems, has let her down. Having lost her family, her fiance, and her fortune, Ada journeys from Boston to Hickory Ridge, Tennessee, to take a position as a lady&#39;s companion. Though initially charmed by the pretty little Southern town tucked into the foothills of the great Smokies, Ada plans to stay only until she can earn enough to establish a millinery shop.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Her employer, Wyatt Caldwell, the local lumber mill owner, is easily the kindest, most attractive man Ada has met in Hickory Ridge. He believes Providence has brought her to town and into his life. But how, after so many betrayals, can she ever trust again? Besides, Wyatt has a dream of his own. A dream that will one day take him far from Hickory Ridge.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;As the South struggles to heal in the aftermath of the Civil War, one woman must let go of her painful past in order to embrace God&#39;s plans for her. Can she trust Him, and Wyatt, with her future and her heart?&lt;/P&gt;" />
