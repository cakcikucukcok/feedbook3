  <title>Juniper - Kevin DeLayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Keith Warner is facing past injuries and losses in his mid-life that have left him troubled and disillusioned. The mysterious death of his best friend and mentor sends him across the country to make an unexpected discovery. Through his scattered memories; some very mysterious and bizarre phenomenon; and the heartless attacks of a relentless adversary, Keith would be forced to weigh his life and calling truthfully. What began as a journey to comfort his friends grieving family would now become Keiths own pathway to personal healing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kevin DeLayne has written a masterful novel about spiritual warfare! Anyone can relate to his life-like characters who struggle with everyday life. He shows that bad things happen to good people, but God can see us through!! Juniper is a must read for every pastor and staff member. It addresses the difficulties of staff relationships as spiritual warfare. A challenging look at forgiveness, redemption, and healing!&lt;,p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Wayne Dismuke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than a mystery.  More than a theological tract. More than a critique of the church. Kevin DeLaynes novel presents one mans confrontation with evil, and the power of Gods deliverance. DeLayne is an honest artist with a sure grip on his narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
