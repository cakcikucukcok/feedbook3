  <title>Autumn Secrets - J. G. Piccolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robert Burkholder, a successful pro quarterback in San Diego, seems to have everything that a glamorous California lifestyle promises will make him happy: a fabulous beach house, amazing parties with celebrity friends, and a gorgeous model named Taylor who is eager to date him. Yet feelings about his guilty past begin to prevent him from committing to her, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While visiting Pennsylvania after an injury sidelines him, Robert meets Anna Miller, the kind Mennonite mother of a talented high school football player that his alma mater just happens to be desperate to recruit. As he builds a relationship with Anna, along with her son Jacob and his sassy girlfriend Jenny, Robert finds himself questioning his worldly values and seeking spiritual answers amid a new community of Christian friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the colorful fall landscapes of Pennsylvania call to his heart, will Robert chase Taylor in California or return to his roots where Anna awaits? Will long hidden autumn secrets awaken dormant passions and help Robert choose between love, football, and his faith?&lt;/p&gt;" />
