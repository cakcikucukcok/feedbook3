  <title>The Bug Man 3-in-1 - Tim Downs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three novels from Tim Downs now available in one e-book collection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;First the Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick tries to find a killer in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina&amp;rsquo;s attack on New Orleans. But the more he digs the stronger&amp;mdash;and deadlier&amp;mdash;the resistance becomes. Nick is there to collect bodies, and he&#39;s going to do just that&amp;mdash;especially when he starts finding bodies that were clearly dead before the hurricane. He understands that all forensic evidence will soon disintegrate in the hot, contaminated water . . . and he knows that&#39;s exactly what the killer wants to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Less than Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick has finally met his match. When a grave is discovered on property owned by the front-running candidate for the next presidential election, the FBI immediately becomes involved. The graves then vanish and Nick follows local legend to the bizarre Alena who keeps to herself in the mountains of Northern Virginia, training cadaver dogs. Together they discover that this small town&amp;mdash;and the presidential-hopeful&amp;mdash;have closets full of skeletons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ends of the Earth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick struggles to protect a victim&amp;rsquo;s family from agro-terrorists in North Carolina. After dissecting the remains of a bale of marijuana scattered in the tomato fields, Nick learns that the South American marijuana is strangely infested with a common North Carolina insect: the tobacco hornworm. To further confound the mystery, the bugs are infected with a fungus from Asia, and Nick begins to suspect his victim wasn&#39;t killed because of the marijuana, but because of the insects it contained. He then discovers that a vicious agricultural scheme is underway to cripple US corn and ethanol production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nick of Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bug Man is getting married on Saturday &amp;nbsp;. . . if his fianc&amp;eacute;e can find him.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forensic entomologist Nick Polchak lives in a world of maggots and blow flies and decomposing bodies. No wonder he&#39;s still single.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Nick has finally found a woman as strange as he is&amp;mdash;dog trainer Alena Savard, a woman who is odd, reclusive, and can seemingly talk to animals. It was a match made in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nick and Alena are scheduled to be married on Saturday&amp;mdash;but there&#39;s one small problem. Nick has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caught up in a murder case involving an old friend, Nick finds himself on a manhunt that&#39;s drawing him farther and farther from the church where Alena is waiting. But will he make it back in time? Could Nick&#39;s single-minded focus cause him to forget his own wedding? Is he really pursuing a killer, or is he running away from something else?&lt;/p&gt;" />
