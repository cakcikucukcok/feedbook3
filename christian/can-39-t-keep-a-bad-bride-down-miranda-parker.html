  <title>Can&#39;t Keep a Bad Bride Down - Miranda Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A fast-paced, thrilling read.&quot; --Electa Rome Parks, author of &lt;i&gt;The Stalker Chronicles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bail  recovery agent Angel Crawford isn&#39;t sure which is tougher--fighting  crime, letting go of the skeletons in her past, or planning for her  wedding. Either way, she&#39;s dealt with her share of surprises. But just  when she least expects it, she gets the shock of her life.  .  .&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s  been months since Angel and Pastor Justus Too-Hot-To-Be-Holy Morgan  announced their engagement. Yet Angel&#39;s barely begun wedding planning.  It&#39;s not that she&#39;s having doubts. She just wants to make sure the past  doesn&#39;t interfere with their future. For Angel, that means clearing up a  kiss-tastrophe with U.S. Marshal Maxim West and facing off with her  ex-fiancé&#39;s assassin. Angel wants to share her plans with Justus, but  before she can do it, a new complication arrives.  .  . &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise For Miranda Parker&lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I had such a good time reading this novel!
