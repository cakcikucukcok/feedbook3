  <title>The Other Side of Loss - Tom Vaughan</title>

It&amp;#39;s all in the dream, just the possibility - however remote.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the Revd Robert Melton first arrives at St Mungo&amp;#39;s, his initial enthusiasm quickly turns to despondency - until the biggest jackpot in US lottery history triggers a series of uncanny events that throws him, and the seemingly unconnected lives of people on both sides of the Atlantic, into a vortex of questioning, self-doubt and the search for truth. For all of them, try as they might to escape it, the past remains a constant presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the run-down despair of Robert&amp;#39;s dying inner London parish to the yearnings for love and physical contact of the city&amp;#39;s social outcasts - and from the money-driven hubris of Manhattan&amp;#39;s financial elite to the home-spun wisdom of rural New England - The Other Side of Loss is a modern-day parable of loss and redemption, of despair and triumph, of human weakness and the life-affirming salvation of human strength in all its meanings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Any novel that weaves a high-tension narrative out of two priests, prostitution, and a lottery ticket has to keep you turning the pages.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gyles Brandreth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Zounds!
