  <title>Fortune&#39;s Bride - Jane  Peart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Slowly she turned to face the door just as Graham came through at full stride. At the sight of him a wild kind of joy seized her. Graham halted on the threshold. He drew in his breath sharply, and in spite of himself, his pulse thundered at the sight of the tall, willowy figure. The last time he had seen Avril she had been a child. Here in her place was a graceful young woman. &quot;Avril, my dear,&quot; he said, finding his voice. &quot;Welcome home!&quot; Fortune&#39;s Bride, the third in a series of award-winning novels by Jane Peart, is a revision of the story of Avril Dumont, a wealthy young heiress and orphan, who gradually comes to terms with her lonely adolescence. There is romance and heartbreak, true love and fulfillment in this story of Avril&#39;s seemingly unreturned but undaunted love for her bachelor guardian, Graham Montrose. Readers of Fortune&#39;s Bride will be smitten with the charm of the old South as they follow Avril&#39;s development into womanhood, and meet the people who give her a sense of self-worth. So skillfully drawn is the plot of this romance that the reader will suffer form ongoing suspense throughout Avril&#39;s story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
