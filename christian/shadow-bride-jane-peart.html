  <title>Shadow Bride - Jane  Peart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Rod it was a moment out of a thousand dreams. Yet the reality was more than he could have imagined. &quot;Blythe!&quot; He said her name and in his voice was all the hope he&#39;d thought was lost. The woman he saw was even lovelier than the girl he remembered. She was still as beautiful -- tall, slender, the glorious auburn hair, the soft, vulnerable mouth and peachbloom skin -- as when he had first met her at Montclair. At sixteen, Blythe had been shy, eager to be accepted and loved, now she was poised, fashionably dressed, self-confident. But in those same velvety brown eyes Rod saw what he was searching for -- that she still loved him. Would it be possible to bridge all the silent years that had separated them? Or had they changed too much? Had too much happened to make them different from the people they had been when they had fallen in love? Was it too late? Shadow Bride continues the story of the gallant bride of Malcolm Montrose, Blythe Dorman, who struggled so unselfishly to save a marriage that should never have been, that ended tragically before her son&#39;s birth. After heartbreak, despair, and sorrow, Blythe gathers up the fragments of her life and builds a new one for them both in England. Before she can find lasting happiness, Blythe must come to terms with her past, confront her heart&#39;s truth, and search for her own heritage. To find her real identity and true love, she has to meet these challenges and choices as the woman she has become, not as the girl she once was.&lt;/p&gt;" />
