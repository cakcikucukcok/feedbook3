  <title>Runaway Saint - Lisa Samson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;When her aunt shows up homeless&amp;nbsp;on her doorstep, Sara suspects anything but a miracle.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Sara’s an artist with a supportive husband and a house that&amp;nbsp;folks on her block admire outright. But she’s restless and bored with life.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Then her legendary Aunt Bel shows up, wearing a smile after years without a word.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Twenty years ago, fresh out of college,&amp;nbsp;Bel left for a summer missions trip and never returned. Now she’s on Sara’s doorstep, looking for a place to crash. Sara can’t say no to family, even if she hasn’t seen Bel since she was a nine-year-old girl. But saying yes to Bel turns Sara’s whole precariously-balanced life upside down.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The enigmatic Bel gives Sara’s family and their community a jolt of fresh thinking and clarity.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;But Bel is hiding something. Though she won’t talk about it, Sara soon learns that Bel has been through a hellish ordeal. And she has the burn marks to prove it.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;[Samson&#39;s] gift for creating unique, flawed character elevates this book above others. Each line has so much truth, and readers will likely ponder different passages long after finishing.&quot; —&lt;I&gt;Romantic Times Review&lt;/I&gt;, TOP PICK! 4 1/2 stars&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&quot;Samson’s quirky characters will have readers laughing, crying, and shaking their heads in disbelief, sometimes all at the same time. This uplifting read . . . will attract fans of women’s fiction and especially works by authors Sarah Jio, Anne Tyler, and Alice Hoffman.&quot; —&lt;I&gt;Library Journal&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
