      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;bestselling author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Wedding Dress&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;comes a new captivating novel of two women whose lives have been destroyed by disaster but find healing in a special house.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 1953, Everleigh Applegate is happily married and newly pregnant. But a tornado sweeps through Waco, Texas, taking her hopes of a bright future with it. Seven years later, widowed and childless, she is living with her mother and older than her years. It is not until she runs into an old high school friend, Don Callahan, that a small spark of hope for what life could be is rekindled. However, a secret Everleigh has kept threatens their happiness and future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beck Holiday is a tough, angry, New York City cop. Her father&amp;rsquo;s death on 9/11 took not just her father&amp;rsquo;s life but many of her memories as well. She learns that she&amp;rsquo;s inherited a house from an Everleigh Callahan&amp;mdash;whom Beck apparently knows but cannot remember&amp;mdash;in north Florida, and her suspension from work because of her anger issues leaves her with time to make the trip to figure out why. Upon her arrival, she meets Bruno Endicott, who clearly remembers her. Beck must work to regain her memory, face her anger, and open her heart to love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connected through a beautiful house in ways they will both come to understand, both women must find the courage to face the truth about themselves and their past in order to truly love and be loved in return.&lt;/p&gt;" />
