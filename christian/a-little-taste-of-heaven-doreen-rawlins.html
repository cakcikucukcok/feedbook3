  <title>A Little Taste of Heaven - Doreen Rawlins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kate Alexander was certain it was the right thing, taking her papa to Oregon. But a series of unpredictable events along the way would change Kate&#39;s life forever. Taken hostage in a stage coach robbery, she was led to the edge of a bluff, where Kate would fall &quot;head over heels&quot; in love with cowboy, Max Reed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Millie Thatcher, the winsome proprietress of the Inn at Thatcher Springs, welcomed travelers into an oasis of waxed floors and baking bread. Millie was the essence of Christian kindness. Who would ever guess the pain she bore; the loss she suffered? Her deep faith kept her ever hopeful that someday, somehow, she would find her Grace.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Lila Penrose, abandoned as a baby, grew up to be beautiful, inside and out. She loved God and music and poetry. It could only be Divine Intervention that would bring her to the love of her life, Cody Walton, a no-account hooligan, thief and trouble maker; a jailbird in his youth. This story, set against a backdrop of the Western Frontier, weaves the lives of an unlikely band of characters from many backgrounds, into a bond stronger than family. It&#39;s a story of hope and redemption of women who love their men, cherish their children and serve their God with passion. It&#39;s a story relevant to every era.&lt;/p&gt;" />
