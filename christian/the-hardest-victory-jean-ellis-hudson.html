  <title>The Hardest Victory - Jean Ellis Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clem and Susannah Brown and their three adult children, Thomas, age. 21, Ruth, age 20, and Jeff, age 18, in the year of 1912, have much love within their family, but life is not without trials. Clem and Susannah discover that Thomas has a lack of self-control and can even trace it back to childhood. There is anger and jealousy brewing in Thomas that he does not control and thus he strikes out at family members. Upon the death of George Brady, Susannahs father, each member of the family inherits a great deal which enables them to enlarge the farm and improve their lives. Ruth meets a fine young man and after a period of courting, they get married. Clyde Armour still works with Clem and is basically a partner by 1912, while he and his wife Lillian have two children. Another hired hand is added to the farm named Zeb Stuart. Their pastor Tim Hawthorne talks with Thomas a great deal about his problems, walking as a Christian, and staying out of certain establishments. Follow the route Thomas life takes as it intertwines with Jeffs." />
