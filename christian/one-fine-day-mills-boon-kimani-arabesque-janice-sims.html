  <title>One Fine Day (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) - Janice Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Giving up his high-flying career as an attorney to work in his family&#39;s California vineyard was one of the best things Jason Bryant ever did. The other was falling in love with beautiful bookstore owner Sara Minton.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jason knows that Sara loves him, which makes her refusal to marry him even more frustrating. Why does Sara keep saying she&#39;ll be able to marry him &#39;one day&#39;? Whatever her secret is, Jason is sure he can cope. But not knowing the truth is tearing him apart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six years ago Sara was at her lowest ebb, until Aminatu&#39;s Daughters–a secret organization that helps women and children in jeopardy–gave her life purpose again. Now Sara faces an impossible choice between the man she adores and her dangerous but rewarding work. And as Sara&#39;s very safety comes under threat, she and Jason must risk everything to claim a future together…&lt;/p&gt;
