  <title>Grace&#39;s War - Debbie Watkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;GRACES WAR is the story of one womans journey to rescue girls from human slavery. Although fictional, much of the book is inspired by the true accounts and situations of thousands of women and girls from around the world who suffer at the hands of brutal traffickers. It is the powerful story of Grace, an English teacher, who finds deliverance from her own addictions and fears at a little orphanage, The Cielo, in the Colombian hills. A series of events unfold and Grace is led by God from Colombia to India where she is used to help victims of human trafficking find their own freedom. Grace is finally delivered from the overwhelming effects of her own struggles by helping others to overcome theirs. The changing destinations and fulfilled dreams of the women and girls she meets are central to the books message of grace and redemption. Amongst those she meets along the way are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DivyaA young Indian girl sold into debt slavery and prostitution. Stolen one night from a quarry in rural Thane, will she find her loved ones again?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AayanaKidnapped by a warlord from her village in Somalia to fight in his army, the Somali girl faces a perilous future till she meets the One they call Jesus Christ. Where will her new life take her?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
AlishaBeautiful and sensitive, Alisha is kidnapped as a girl and sold into the sex trade of Mumbais red-light district. Another tragedy in her life leads her to the greatest of all Loves, but at what price?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
During the course of her journey, Graces life becomes closely connected to the enigmatic priest, Joseph. And then there is Mark, an aid worker with a heart as wide as the Ganges. Will Grace ever find love?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Exquisitely detailed characters and settings form the backdrop to this extraordinary tale. The many spiritual gems woven into the fabric of the story will resonate with the personal battles we all face and will captivate and enthrall readers at the outset.&lt;/p&gt;" />
