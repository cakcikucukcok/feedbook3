  <title>Striving to Know - Sylvia Lavey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Striving to Know&quot; is a quick-read. At a small private college, as freshmen students find their way during the first semester, four students with varying interests become good friends. There&#39;s Holly, a psychology major with interest in parapsychology, who is looking forward to a summer internship at Harvard. There&#39;s Greg, who thinks he wants to major in electrical engineering. Charlie is immersed in his own world of religion, and Sarah is a geology-archaeology major.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each faces challenges regarding their spiritual beliefs, and each becomes preoccupied with events and situations that take place in their lives while on campus-including the appearance of a mysterious man. In the midst of their difficulties, they learn of a monthly &quot;Let&#39;s Talk&quot; meeting held for students and the community with a spiritual adviser who answers questions, gives advice, and talks about how synchronicity takes place in their lives, clarifying how each person actually helps to create their own reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A work of religious fiction, Striving to Know tells a story about resolve, personal growth, and how friends&#39; support for one another helps them to achieve their final goals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
