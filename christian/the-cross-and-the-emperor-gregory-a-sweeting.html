  <title>The Cross and the Emperor - Gregory A Sweeting</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This historical novel purports to take place shortly after the crucifixion of Jesus Christ by Pontius Pilate, the Roman Governor of Judea, somewhere around 33 AD after Jesus had sent His disciples into the world. He instructed them to preach the Good News of Salvation to everyone they met. Dedicated and sincere men and women rose to the occasion and, often at great risk to themselves, took the Gospel all over the Roman world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing liberally from British folklore, actual historical legend, and using some of the familiar names from The Bible, this story suggests one way that God might have ensured that the Gospel was brought to Wales and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in any good novel, there are heroes and adversaries which weave the threads of the story together. The Welsh warrior, Caradog ap Bran, is our hero. It is imagined that he might have been joined by a couple of familiar people from the Biblical record to bring the Good News to Wales. Interposing an element of the supernatural into the story adds a layer of intrigue to the novel and proposes that we have been in an invisible spiritual battle ever since Time began.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is my prayer that The Spirit of God will then take the seed that has been planted though this story of fiction, sprinkled with doses of reality and use it for His glory, creating in the reader an interest to find out more from the Source and The Message of the Holy Bible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
