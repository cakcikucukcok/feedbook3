      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you tired of going through life filled with uncertainty? Do you live each day wondering about the essence of your existence and grappling with questions about your purpose in life? Do you wonder whether it is even possible to attain true happiness? I have been there. I have had my fair share of fears, uncertainties, and struggles. I know how it feels to wake up and not have the enthusiasm to go through the rest of the day. I am here not only to tell you it gets better, but also show you how.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s Time to Start Living with Passion&lt;/em&gt; is my journey through the bumpy road of self discovery. It details the highs and lows and everything I had to go through to find my passion. From changing careers, to navigating family life, to getting an MBA, trying to find fulfilment has not been easy. However, it was worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was written to help you live to your full potential by understanding who you are and conquering your fears. I believe that every experience has shaped me into the man I am today. The challenges and lessons along the way all worked to deliver the ultimate reward, and they are all here in this book. It is my wish that after reading my book, you will find the answers you have been looking for and make your first step towards a passionate and fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the Author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jean Paul Paulynice is the Founder of Paulynice Consulting Group. He lives his passion by formulating business strategies to help small businesses hack the corporate world and helping those around him reach their full potential through self-development.&lt;/p&gt;" />
