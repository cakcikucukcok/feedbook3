  <title>Avatar - Rajesh Jain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the beginning of time, humanity has longed for the day when justice, peace, equality and compassion will envelop the world. Scripture and holy books of various religions predict a future leader who will unite religions, defeat evil, and establish the Kingdom of Heaven on earth. Today, Jews long for their messiah Meshiack, Christians seek the return of Jesus Christ, Muslims await Imam Mahdi, Buddhists look for the Fifth Buddha Maitreya, Hindus seek the Tenth Avatar Kalki, and Confucian texts speak of a future True Man who will bring peace. But can one man actually fulfill all these religious expectations?
Rajesh Jain, a physician by trade, relies on his intuitive experiences, scripture, and research to share a deep examination of various religions and their beliefs regarding the Second Coming, the prophecies of Nostradamus, technological deceptions by elite nations, enigmas of consciousness by Chris King, the American model of unsustainability by Chris Clugston, and the metaphysical concept of Pi by Patrick Mulcahy. Included are his explorations of the education system, the Catholic Church, the labor market, and taxes.
