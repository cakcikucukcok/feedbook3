  <title>GUTS - Sam Bracken, Bill Curry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Living a life of grit and grace&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you want to understand the important difference between head, heart, and gut and where each fits into better decision-making?
&lt;li&gt;Are you ready to enjoy a purpose driven life and all of the joy and contentment it can bring?&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;GUTS&lt;/i&gt; will help you find that purpose driven life that is yours to live with joy, passion and success.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Grit and grace:&lt;/b&gt; When Angela Duckworth wrote her best selling book &lt;i&gt;Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance&lt;/i&gt; she could have been describing Sam Bracken who is the embodiment of living a life of grit and grace.
&lt;p&gt;   
&lt;b&gt;Find your own Duckworth grit:&lt;/b&gt; In this modern era, we tap an app on our smartphone and anything you can imagine is delivered to you ? maybe even by drone. We live in an age of convenience and ease; personal butlers are back in fashion and everyone has a chauffeur on call thanks to Uber. When was the last time you really “went for it?” Does anyone even have to try anymore? Sam Bracken answers that question with an emphatic YES. Now, more than ever, is the time to go for the gusto, to find your own Duckworth grit.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tenacity, courage and the fire within:&lt;/b&gt; In his book &lt;i&gt;GUTS&lt;/i&gt;, Bracken explains why we all need to dig deep and do soul searching to see what lights the fire within that brings forth our very best. Bracken’s backstory would make Dr. Phil turn tail and run. His childhood and upbringing are unimaginably tough with years of abuse, even to the point where a relative set him on fire. What didn’t kill Sam Bracken made him stronger. And, he is now on a mission to bring self empowerment to others ? self empowerment to realize a life of grit and grace.
&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;b&gt;Grit and grace and mental strength:&lt;/b&gt; When we say something takes guts, we usually mean it takes courage to do it. It takes guts to go skydiving or to run a marathon or to try out for the school play. We call it luck or stamina or intestinal fortitude in conquering the hard, albeit exciting, things in life. Look back at the great personalities who made a difference in the pages of history. What did they all have in common? Determination and tenacity. In short, GUTS! They might have had talent too, but without guts they would have gone nowhere. Science now tells us that lots of talented individuals produce great stuff, but very few produce a lot of great stuff—and even fewer produce a lot of great stuff over a long career. What do these few highly productive people have in common? Grit and grace and a large helping of self-belief.
&lt;p&gt;   
&lt;b&gt;Purpose driven life:&lt;/b&gt; This book is about actually getting there. You’ll have to push past failure again and again. And it is also about beating the odds no matter how high they are stacked against you. To be a true leader, you have to start with yourself. Are you ready to do some soul searching and learn the secrets to guts, self empowerment, a purpose driven life, and grit and grace?
&lt;p&gt;   
&lt;b&gt;In Sam Bracken&#39;s &lt;i&gt;GUTS&lt;/i&gt;, you will learn about:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mental strength
&lt;li&gt;resisting feelings of low self esteem
&lt;li&gt;self empowerment 
&lt;li&gt;building self confidence
&lt;li&gt;living a life of passion
&lt;li&gt;and, most importantly, what it takes to have grit and grace" />
