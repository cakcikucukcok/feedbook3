  <title>Gorgeous for God - Lisa Natoli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gorgeous for God is the story of my own spiritual awakening, based on A Course in Miracles. It is very ordinary story. Things happened slowly for methere were no bells
or whistles. No going into the light. I didnt have a near-death
experience. Instead, one by one, things that were no longer serving
me dissolved and fell awayalcoholism, cigarette-smoking, fear,
conflict, doubt. I found that as time went on, the ego-identity that
I had built up over the years started to crumble, slowly, very slowly
(at times painfully-slow!) and I found myself having almost no
interest in the things I used be interested in.
For me, enlightenment was when I stopped seeking for ways to
improve myself. It was when I recognized that my old way of being
was not working. I realized the necessity to see myself differently,
as loved, loving and lovable, and not try to come up with a new
improved identity." />

I found A Course in Miracles in 1992.<br /><b><i>Gorgeous for God Â« Lisa Natoli</i></b> | The perfect how to live manual, "Gorgeous for God" guides you through the magnificence of surrendering to Spirit. With ease and humor, Lisa Natoli allows you to understand that being "infinitely patient" produces "immediate results" when it comes to enlightenment.<br /><b><i>Gorgeous for God: Awakening Through a Course in Miracles ...</i></b> | Then I found "Gorgeous for God." I related to everything Lisa Natoli spoke about in her book. She is a beautiful teacher and relays the Course's message in the clearest way. As I was still relatively new to the Course it felt wonderful to hear how someone else had benefited from the Course and how it was working in her life.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Gorgeous for God - Lisa Natoli</a> </h3></p><hr/>
