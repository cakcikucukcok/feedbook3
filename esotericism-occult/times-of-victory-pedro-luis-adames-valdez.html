  <title>Times of Victory - Pedro Luis Adames Valdez</title>

The Meditations of Pedro Luis Adames Valdez
The topic of religion is one that&#39;s becoming increasingly contested with the advent of globalization as it became increasingly apparent that there are more many more faiths out there than meet the eye. Each and every one has its own belief system and designations, with a few being much more heavily-proliferated and discussed than others, namely Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Simultaneously, the sceptics are more numerous than ever before, with atheism and agnosticism gaining popularity, especially amongst the intelligent elite. Whether or not you&#39;re a religious person though, I believe that there is much for us to learn from the teachings passed down through holy scriptures for they often connect with our lives in surprisingly non-religious ways. I myself am not a religious person, and thus it is precisely the approach I took to Times of Victory by Pedro Luis Adames Valdez.
For those who aren&#39;t familiar with the man, Valdez came from the small town of Altagracia (High Grace) in the Dominican Republic, and to keep things short, his life definitely hasn&#39;t been on the easy side. Squalor and a fractured family set the stage for his road towards God, and since then he has grown into an international sensation, his preaching having been heard in a couple dozen countries around the world. In this book of his, Valdez expresses the culmination of his life&#39;s work and experience following God, serving him and his fellow man as best he can. It&#39;s divided into twenty-three chapters, each one tackling a specific topic always in relation to religion, such as the importance of obeying God, of learning to recognize his miracles and how to reach out and bask in his light, just to name a few. However, in addition to that Valdez also takes the time to create connections between those religious teachings and our daily lives, looking at ways in which we can apply them to our mundane trials and tribulations. Ultimately, he seeks to impart a mindset which he believes can help one to attain happiness while improving the world around them. He complements his meditations with various passages from the bible which hold special significance for him, as well as personal stories and anecdotes that help cement his ideas.
A Matter of Approach
To start things off, let us examine this book as viewed from the perspective of a devout Christian. Though I myself cannot be classified in that group, I can still provide my objective opinion, which is that Times of Victory is a thinking person&#39;s book that could serve people of any religion quite well. The interpretations and arguments are as far from baseless as you can imagine, with there always being a firm logical structure based on concrete experiences to back everything up. Valdez has this gift of being able to interpret biblical texts in a sort of practical, rational and modern way to help them gain a meaning that is concurrent with contemporary times. His approach to understanding his religion is one many of us would do well to model after. In other words, I believe if you&#39;re a religious person, at best you&#39;ll gain plenty of new and interesting insights to mull over, and at worst you&#39;ll come to learn about Valdez&#39;s unusual perspective on things.
On the other hand, if like myself you are not a religious person, then you&#39;re likely thinking that this book is just not up your alley and not even consider it. However, there is much to be learned here outside the scope of God and religion, a way of life that anyone can apply themselves to and strive to improve the world around them. Valdez gives very tangible reasons and arguments as to why a life dedicated to helping others and appreciating the beauty of this world is one heavily worth considering, and that alone I believe is reason enough to read it.
A Marriage of Entertainment and Religion
So far I may have made it sound like this book is a strict and serious work of writing one must read wit furrowed brows. However, the truth is much closer to the opposite side of the spectrum. The many personal stories and anecdotes shared by Valdez are often touching, revealing, thought-provoking and comical, with the man having a great sense of humour as well as quality penmanship to help convey it. While some of them do feel a tad tame in comparison with the gut-wrenching biographies of the innumerable James Bonds and Ramboes that seem to have graced the world in the past decades, they all have a curious, if not educative element that elevates them above the status of mere stories.
None of the passages feel boring or as if they drag on, with virtually all chapters lasting one to three pages, concise as ever in their purpose. As a matter of fact, at about seventy pages long, there is literally nowhere to get bogged down in this book and you&#39;ll no doubt finish it in a short evening. In other words, the author understands exactly what his audience wants and needs. While there are a few tiny hiccups when it comes to the translation, on the whole the book is well written and I wager none of the meaning has been lost.
The Final Verdict
To finish things off, I believe Times of Victory to be an insightful, funny and educative read that will serve different people in varying ways, depending on which walks of life they come from. If you have an afternoon to spare and would like to witness a learned man&#39;s perspective on God, life and the human condition, then you should definitely give the book a shot. The road towards absolute enlightenment appears infinite, but I feel this is one piece of writing that can move us forth along that path ever so slightly." />
