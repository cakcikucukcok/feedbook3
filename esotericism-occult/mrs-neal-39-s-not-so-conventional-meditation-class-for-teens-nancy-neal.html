  <title>Mrs. Neal&#39;s Not-So-Conventional Meditation Class for Teens - Nancy Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; What if we were taught as teenagers how to have a healthy relationship with ourselves? What if we were taught from a very young age how to naturally calm our anxiety and understand ourselves as individuals? &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt; Mrs. Neals passion is to bring this opportunity to as many teens as possible. Her book, &lt;i&gt;mrs. neals not-so-conventional Meditation Class for Teens&lt;/i&gt;, provides a resource to help young people develop into themselves with greater ease and confidence. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The universal truths written in her new book are simple for teens to understand, and to apply to their daily lives, producing immediate results. Her meditation exercise is a useful daily tool for relaxation, and for teaching teens how to come back into their natural state of being, which is free of anxiety and depression.&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Mrs. Neal, I LOVE THIS BOOK! I like that it has so much information, and how it explains everything. It is all so positive and uplifting, and the quotes are great! I cant wait to read it again and do all the Student Challenges, Homework Assignments and the other exercises. I have already been starting my day with a more positive attitude. I want all my friends to read this, too! Thank you for writing this for us! &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
