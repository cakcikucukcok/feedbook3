  <title>Message for the Tribe of Many Colors - Kiesha Crowther</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; &quot;Humanity now stands on the threshold of an immense spiritual transformation  that has been prophesied to come at this time on Earth by almost all ancient and  indigenous cultures. This unique and much-awaited book - by one of the most inspired  young female voices for change on the planet - will open your heart and your eyes to the  deep mysteries of existence. Through moving personal memoir and prophetic revelation,  Little Grandmother shares teachings and visions directly given to her by her spirit guides  and Mother Earth. She shows how the key to ascending with Mother Earth into a higher  state lies hidden in our own hearts, in the remembrance of who we really are. In these  pages are simple but powerful keys to our spiritual evolution at this time, and visions  of the profound changes in store for the Earth and humanity in the coming years. By  remembering what we once knew as human beings and by returning to our hearts, we  can change our future and shift into something more beautiful than we ever imagined.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;      &lt;br&gt; Advance Praise: &lt;/br&gt;    &lt;p&gt; &quot;Little Grandmother walks with humility and integrity. Because of this the old ones  have chosen her to convey their message of such deep and profound wisdom for the  betterment of our beloved Earth Mother and all who dwell upon and within her. This  book is a gift to the world.&quot; - Makere Ruka Te Korako, a grandmother of Waitaha, Te  Atiawa, and Ngati Tama&lt;/p&gt;" />
