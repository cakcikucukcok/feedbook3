      <meta name="description" content="From the day we are born, we are taught how and what to think by those around us. Most people are unaware of the misinformation that they have been receiving throughout their lives. The mainstream public gets the majority of their information from either the media or the education system. These two sources are biased and have changed and omitted much of the true history and information available. The truth is not taught to the masses because those who are in control do not want to give up their control. Truth is the light, and knowledge is power. By keeping true knowledge a secret, the common person is kept powerless. Those in power have not just hidden information from us; they have convinced the majority of people in the world that much of the ancient knowledge and science is just a storya fairy tale. In order to discredit the truth even further, movies, shows, and books use actual and or possible events and knowledge but call the works fictional." />
