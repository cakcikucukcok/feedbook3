  <title>The Purpose Of Your Life: Finding Your Place In The World Using Synchronicity, Intuition, And Uncommon Sense - Carol Adrienne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The co-author of &lt;em&gt;The Celestine Prophecy Experiential Guide&lt;/em&gt; helps readers uncover the unsuspected, untapped power of synchronicity and intuition that will bring success, satisfaction, and serenity. &lt;p&gt;Everyone really has a purpose in life, says Carol Adrienne in her new guide to harnessing the power inside yourself. The question is: How do you learn to go with the flow and let your true nature guide you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chapter by chapter, &lt;em&gt;The Purpose of Your Life&lt;/em&gt; explains how to locate the source of your innate energy and focus it, how to align yourself with the natural forces that swirl around us always, and how to develop the intuition that fosters synchronicity. The book is packed with illuminating anecdotes and profiles of fascinating people -- from artists to urban planners to Zen masters -- who describe how they found their own purposes. There are practical exercises throughout, along with charts, self-questionnaires, and other tools that help you understand yourself and your deepest aspirations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you learn to recognize and trust the voice of intuition, you&#39;ll find new doors opening and new possibilities everywhere. You&#39;ll feel invigorated by the potential you&#39;ve unleashed, a power that will only grow with each new accomplishment. And you&#39;ll discover the serenity and satisfaction that come only to those who are living life to the fullest. The Force is with you -- all you have to do is reach out and start to use it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
