  <title>Bits of Spirit &amp; Parts of Soul&quot;...Reclaiming  the Archetypes of Creation Within. - Nevine Z Rottinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within every human as within the whole of creation, there exist major fundamental directive and working energetic programmes. 
Some call these massive force fields of influence the Archetypes, whilst others call them Morphological Fields. Ancient cultures recognised them as their Gods &amp; Goddesses. 
These force fields define the blueprints for the building blocks of matter as well as the actual mechanisms or &quot;technology&quot; which operate throughout the Cosmos. To understand these Fundamental force fields is to understand the Energy Blueprint from which the Cosmos is both structured &amp; driven. Some call the sum of these Force fields ; the &quot;Mind of God&quot;. 
These fundamental energy fields are perhaps best understood, as the &quot;bits&quot; of Prime Creator (Great Spirit) &amp; the &quot;parts of soul&quot; within humans, plants, animals, &amp; the elements throughout creation. 
As you read Book 1 and Book 2 describing the Major Archetypes of Creation, you will gain a profound understanding of yourself &amp; the force field which permeates the very &quot;Stuff of Creation&quot;. 
The content within these 2 books is divided into four&quot; stand-alone parts&quot; which allow you the reader the freedom to explore any single group of archetypes in any order you wish. Included, are sections for those who wish to use the Vibrational Essences &amp; Elixirs which are designed to activate &amp; enhance these same Archetypal Energies within you should you wish it. 
The material is channeled &amp; may at times break grammatical rules. Just read as is you will understand the reason." />
