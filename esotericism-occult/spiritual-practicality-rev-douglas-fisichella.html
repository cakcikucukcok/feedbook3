  <title>Spiritual Practicality - Rev. Douglas Fisichella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Energy follows thought. Creation on any level is the result of conscious choice, facilitated by mind and brought into physical reality through action, based on the desire to see the idea realized. The understanding of these concepts brings extraordinary power and responsibility into the life of the so-called average person. These are not impractical ideas ill-suited to modern life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiritual Practicality is the integration of your spiritual life in its totality to practical living. You live spiritually through every experience, because your awareness is changed. When you truly live spiritually, you will find that every aspect of your inner life has a practical application in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The so called Success Principals of our age are the Spiritual Principals of the ages and the Ageless Wisdom teachings. Equipped with the Seven Keys to the mysteries, we will reveal the beauty, unity, and yes, the practicality of the spiritual life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is something irresistible about this book. It is an unusual and masterful blend of common sense, clear writing, and advanced metaphysics in a style that is both mature and accessible. Wonderful for seekers of all ages and stages.&lt;/i&gt;
Jonathan Ellerby PhD, bestselling author of Return to the Sacred&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Take the 7 keys and open the door to a realm of knowledge and wisdom masterfully presented by Ageless Wisdom student of 30+ years, Douglas Fisichella. Prepare to embark on a journey that will inspire your own greatness!&lt;/i&gt;
Liz Sterling - Author, Radio Personality, Motivational Speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A wonderfully broad survey of the universal wisdom teachings which lie at the heart of both eastern and western traditions. Rev. Fisichella displays an unusual knack for bringing the teachings alive, making them easily accessible and absorbing to both beginning and seasoned students.&lt;/i&gt;
