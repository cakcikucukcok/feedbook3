  <title>Spirit Heals - Meredith Young-Sowers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Meredith L. Young-Sowers has created a definitive book for women on mind/body/spirit healing that puts women’s connection to Spirit at the very center — exactly where it should be. Drawing on her twenty-seven years as an intuitive healer and spiritual teacher, and her belief that healing is something we do every day, Meredith gently guides women to create our own loving and workable healing plan.
Emphasizing heart disease and reproductive cancers — the diseases that are claiming our mothers, sisters, and friends — Meredith offers a mix of attitude shifts, exercises, and simple meditations to help us harness the power of Spirit. Meredith teaches us to understand and rely on our deep-hearted intuition as our most important healing partner.
In this wide-ranging exploration of healing, you’ll learn to: nourish yourself on all levels — emotional, intellectual, social, physical, and spiritual; respond effectively to stress in a way that heals your heart; understand why mind-body imbalances can sometimes manifest as disease; claim strength and renewal at each stage of your journey." />
