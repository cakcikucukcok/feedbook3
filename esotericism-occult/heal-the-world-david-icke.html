  <title>Heal the World - David Icke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Earth is in crisis. Clearly, humanity has lost touch with Nature. We are, every second, committing appalling damage to the environment, to ourselves, to other species and to the home we share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The answers to environmental decline will not come by trying to persuade politicians and industrialists that urgent and fundamental changes are required. They are motivated by the need to get elected and by self-interest. Neither scientists nor the church seem to know what needs to be done either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What can WE do to heal the world? Former television personality turned world visionary, David Icke gives positive suggestions about how to discover our path and recognise that we are part of a larger consciousness, connecting with others and learning how to heal the Earth. He says we have to begin at home. Healing others and healing the world has to start with self-healing, rediscovering self-respect and love in one&#39;s own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freedom starts with learning and overcoming fear and guilt and releasing our social conditioning. Judging others can become listening and understanding. We need to rediscover Earth&#39;s energies and the special places where we can best connect with these energies, and balance the negative and positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Formerly best-known as a TV sports commentator and leading spokesman for the British Green party, David Icke has gained increasing authority as a tireless campaigner for truth.  His widely publicised spiritual transformation has given him the courage to speak out fearlessly against lies and deceit. David&#39;s engaging, readable style allows complex ideas to be easily understood. He travels extensively, offering public talks and discussions around the UK and USA about the world transformation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
