  <title>When Spirit Calls - Joan Diver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;An extraordinary exploration into the world of healing ministries, spiritual guides, and esoteric experiences. Those who remain enclosed in a world of &amp;#145;hard facts&amp;#8217; will be challenged, for sure, but those who are open to other dimensions, other worlds within this one, have a wide-eyed journey ahead.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;-- Rev. Samuel T. Lloyd III, Rector, Trinity Church, Boston&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#147;Joan Diver is a highly respected leader and accomplished foundation executive who left an inspiring legacy of social change. Her grounding in work for justice, followed by her fall into faith and mystery is captured in this compelling, provocative and generous telling of her journey. I found myself turning pages as if reading a mystery novel, all the while experiencing a deep healing.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;--Pat Brandes, Former COO, United Way of Massachusetts Bay&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;When Spirit Calls&lt;/I&gt; is at once an adventure story and meditation on the healing journey that traces Joan Diver&#39;s odyssey from Boston foundation executive to spiritual healer. Imbued with the wisdom of great spiritual teachers from both East and West, Joan Diver shares a remarkable journey through urban violence, family crisis, physical pain and spiritual awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Joan Diver&amp;#8217;s&lt;/B&gt; family is one of three profiled in J. Anthony Lukas&#39; Pulitzer Prize-winning book, &lt;I&gt;Common Ground: A Turbulent Decade in the Lives of Three American Families&lt;/I&gt;. A national bestseller in 1985, it is still taught in classrooms today. Joan and Colin Diver continue to be treated as celebrities by Boston media and those touched by the pain of their story and the school-busing crisis of the 1970s and &#39;80s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
