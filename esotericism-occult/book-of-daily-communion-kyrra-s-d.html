In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea. The disciples saw him walking on the sea, were troubled with fear. 
Disciples: It is a ghost! 
Jesus: Be of good cheer! It is I. Do not be afraid. 
Peter: Lord! If it is You, command me to walk to you on the water. 
Jesus: Walk! 
And when Peter had come down out of the boat, he walked on the water to go to Jesus. But when he saw that the wind was boisterous, he was afraid. Beginning to sink, he cried out. 
Peter: Lord, save me! 
And immediately Jesus stretched out his hand and caught him. 
Jesus: O you of little faith, why did you doubt? 
And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. Then those who were in the boat came and worshiped him. 
Everyone: Truly! You are the Son of God!" />
