  <title>Splinters from My Rocking Chair - Marcia J. Terpstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about the absolute raw pain of surviving through life after childhood incest. The raw pain emotionally. The raw pain physiologically. The raw pain spiritually. The raw pain mentally. The raw pain physically. The raw pain sexually. The horrific damage done to one&#39;s entire soul. This book is about surviving in a sphere far beyond just walking this earth. This book is about the destruction done as a result of incest far beyond those physical moments of that touching. This book is about the carnage left behind long after those moments of incest were over; the touch was gone. &lt;br /&gt;This book was written not only for incest survivors but also for those who are living with raw pain from abuse of any kind. So survivors of all forms of abuse can tap into and embrace and validate their own life stories of abuse; each one&#39;s individual feelings of raw pain no matter where they came from. &lt;br /&gt;This book was written from a realm beyond a physical existence. This book is written to tell the world that incest and abuse of any kind, especially done to a child, is a lifelong sentence. Surviving after those moments of touch whether done once or a thousand times has the same impact. Those moments of violation alter one&#39;s life and life choices FOREVER! There is no such thing as living a life that remotely seems fair or just; nothing even close to &quot;normal&quot;. The changes of a healthy, full life are stolen from you - TAKEN! It takes years to put the pieces together; to make sense of any of it. But only if you are fortunately enough to do so!&lt;/p&gt;" />
