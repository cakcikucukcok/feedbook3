  <title>Touched by a Galilean - D. Priscilla Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WARNING! Millions will be transformed through Touched by a Galilean.  Are you next? Hopefully, this book, complete with Reflect and Respond exercises, will serve as a powerful launch pad for introspection, discourse, inspiration, and ultimately victory through Jesus Christ. &lt;br&gt;
Touched by a Galilean is an offer for Forgiveness, Deliverance, Food for the Journey, and an opportunity to help the reader grow in Christ.&lt;br&gt;
You too can be touched by this Galilean who completely altered the authors perspectives; and what is the worst thing that will happen to you? Every step you take thereafter will lead you in the direction of the cross, and your every move will attest to your transformation! But there can be no trial without a test, and there can be no transformation without the touch. Just as the author was touched by the Galilean who instantly changed her worldview, so can you encounter Him throughout these pages!&lt;br&gt;" />
