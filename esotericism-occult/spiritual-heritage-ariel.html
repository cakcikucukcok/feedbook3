      <meta name="description" content="Your spiritual heritage is your freedom. Discovering who you are and why you are here will enable you to become the divine spiritual being that you are. It will allow you to connect with your higher self and become a perfect channel for love and light. There are many of us who want to know the truth and who dream of changing the reality around them with love and compassion, teaching, healing, and guiding all those who desire the light and love that brings self-realization and freedom. The light is the truth, and love is the unconditional essence given to us by our creator and connecting us all as one. The intention is to plant a seed of love and light that you can then nurture into realization and find your own unique way of expressing and experiencing the creator within. Through your spiritual heritage, you can begin to remember who and what you are." />
