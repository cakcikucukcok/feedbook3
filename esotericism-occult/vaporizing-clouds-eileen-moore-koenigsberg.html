  <title>Vaporizing Clouds - Eileen Moore Koenigsberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Vaporizing Clouds:
Exploring Mind, Body, &amp; Spirit
by Eileen Moore Koenigsberg
We all know there is more to this world than meets the eye.  
We all have a great potential inside. Most of us only explore the tip of our own icebergs,
of ourselves. This book will help you to explore further, deeper into the workings of your
mind, deeper into the connection to your inner self. It will help you to see how you
influence life in a profound way, and how you can become more aware of your whole
consciousness.
Vaporizing real, physical clouds is something we can all learn to do. This book shows you
how. You will realize through doing the various exercises and techniques, how much
impact you have on your life, on your environment, on things you would never have
imagined. You will be given keys to working with the Universal Laws, including the Law of Attraction, understanding and
directing your mind, and exploring your inner connection to Source.
We all have many different clouds in our lives. We often see clouds as things that are
in our way, or in the way of the light. Come with an open mind and heart, explore your
mind, body and spirit, and uncover your own light of understanding.
