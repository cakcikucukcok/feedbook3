  <title>Teachings of Silver Birch - Silver Birch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the centuries, Spiritualism has always been hindered, yet the movement is the oldest known in the world and has changed along with the evolution of humanity. Silver Birch reveals, as well as others before him, a true knowledge of God that has no need for intermediaries such as churches and theology. Reveals the binding of mediumship with God If today at the history by comparing it to his teachings, it is evident that the strength, the truth and the importance of his words broke the walls and his mission has not been exhausted. Spiritualism is the oldest movement known in the world; it is always the same force of the Spirit that is in operation.&lt;br /&gt;
The philosophy of teachings like the ones you will find in this book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Teachings of Silver Birch, the Spirit Guide of Maurice Barbanell&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, reveals a true knowledge of the concept of God, one that does not need intermediaries like churches or theology. It reveals the bond of mediumship with God; it brings back to us the instruments we need to reason on religiosity.&lt;br /&gt;
The demonstration mediumship gives us that life is eternal, that the spirit and the soul are immortal, has the purpose of bringing us back to the authentic knowledge of God, as Jesus already did. But Jesus Christ&amp;rsquo;s teaching has been lost, in many of its aspects, by churches and by theology themselves. The teachings of Spiritualism lead us to understand why each form of mediumship is a sacred gift at God&amp;rsquo;s service, always, whose purpose is not only to prove us that life is eternal, but also to make us aware that everything is in communion with God; we are all part of the infinite Spirit of God." />
