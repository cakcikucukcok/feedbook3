  <title>Mrs. Lilac&#39;s Year - Paul I. Freet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mrs. Betty Lilac has always been a sort of mystic and has experienced prophetic dreams since she was a young girl. Now in her late fifties, Betty is a tarot card reader extraordinaire. A kind and generous woman, she uses her gift to help others and to make a difference in their lives. But not everyone approves of Bettys talent.&lt;p&gt; 
Mr. Gately, her landlord, has evicted Betty from the comfortable home in which she has lived for twenty years. He claims she practices black magic and has garnered a negative reputation, which is bad for his business. In addition, she begins to receive strange phone calls, notices mysterious cars driving by her property, and observes unusual lights at night in the nearby junkyard.&lt;p&gt; 
Indeed, Bettys year is filled with mystery, danger, sorrow, and loss. Supported by a cast of dedicated friends and clients, she confronts her challenges with aplomb. And when she shuffles and deals the tarot deck, she is surprised at what the cards have to say about her future." />
