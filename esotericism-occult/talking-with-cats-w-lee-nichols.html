  <title>Talking with Cats - W. Lee Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Talking With Cats&lt;/i&gt;, Nichols takes us on a personal journey that enriches the spirit, informs the mind and becomes a map for healing and finding true inner happiness. The author does talk with cats; one of them is wise and thoughtful. Another is sarcastic, rude and funny. He is even ambushed by a horse, anxious to join him on his pilgrimage. On another day, he is attacked by a large German shepherd dogwith a very different outcome than expected. More importantly, he talks with the people who have come to the Camino de Santiago to heal their spirit and find a meaningful life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Story is written with a sense of wonder and reverence for nature, earth and all life. Discover the real heart, soul and spirit of the Camino as you meet the people who walk it, the warm hospitality of the volunteers who care for it, and the rich culture and history of the Spanish people who have inherited the unique DNA of pride and service. During 500 miles, walk with Nichols through the Basque country, the Spain of Old Castile and Leon, and the ancient, proud Celtic tribes of Galicia. Savor the wines, learn about the cuisine, and hear the stories of mystical northern Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Talking With Cats&lt;/i&gt; is not a guide to a place or a destination. It is a guide to our hearts, walking, and the spiritual journey that heals, instructs, and returns us to an authentic life and a sustainable earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
