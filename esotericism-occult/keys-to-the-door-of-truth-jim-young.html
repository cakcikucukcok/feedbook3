  <title>Keys to the Door of Truth - Jim Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;KEYS TO THE DOOR OF TRUTH; Metaphysical Musings of a Born-Yet-Again&lt;/I&gt; builds upon the teachings of its two predecessors.  Written in the context of yet another weekend seminar with Christo Sahbays, in this third entry in the author&#39;s new &lt;I&gt;MY SPIRITUAL AWARENESS SERIES&lt;/I&gt; the fledgling leadership group takes on the means of metaphorical treatment of holy writ.  To be more precise, certain phraseology found in the Gospel of John is found to be the key that unlocks the door to Truth about Spiritual Life as taught by the Master Jesus.  In an amazingly powerful approach that uses metaphor as the Spiritual scalpel that cuts beneath the surface knowledge of intellectual literality, the &quot;secret&quot; meaning of Spiritual intent is revealed with brilliant clarity through the guidance of the Holy Spirit.  This humble intention forms the foundation for continuing metaphysical treatment of future offerings is this intriguing emerging series. &lt;p&gt; 
This book naturally follows the first two offerings in the &lt;I&gt;MY SPIRITUAL AWARENESS SERIES: CREATION SPIRIT, Expressing Your Divinity in Everyday Life and A Labor of Love; Weaving Your Own Virgin Birth on the Loom of Life.&lt;/I&gt; Future writings will deal with such topics as the metaphysical meaning of Jesus and his disciples, the Sermon on the Mount, some of the various &quot;newfound&quot; Gospels, and those portions of the remaining three Gospels that do not replicate the content of the Gospel of John--all placed in a practical perspective." />
