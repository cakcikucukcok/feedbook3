  <title>Journey with Me - Diane M. McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever stopped and wondered why things happen in your life? When my father passed over, he sent me a sign that he was okay. Since his passing, I have gradually become aware of the &quot;help&quot; I receive.&lt;/P&gt;
The son of a friend asked one day, &quot;How did you become aware of the synchronicities in your life?&quot; He heard many of my stories and recognized the uniqueness of the tales. The question took me by surprise. How did I begin to recognize the timing that put me at the right place, at the right time, to either be helped or help someone else?&lt;/P&gt;
I first became aware in Tracking Time, when my presence helped save my neighbors life. While writing &lt;I&gt;To Pap, With Love&lt;/I&gt;, I recognized the guidance I received that prevented harm to my father. His Alzheimer&#39;s disease helped me to live in the present, not dwell on yesterday or concentrate on tomorrow. Along the way, I was &quot;helped&quot; by people and events. I was encouraged to stop worrying, to forgive myself for not being the person I expected myself to be, to trust I would have what I needed." />
