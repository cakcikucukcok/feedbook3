  <title>Which Side Of The Fence Are You On - Beverly A Zeimet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconstruct the Blueprint of your Life!&amp;nbsp;Reclaim and Master your True Identity and Purpose in Life!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Mind Over Matter.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was written to open your mind to a different perspective on the way you think and perform throughout your daily life. It will take you to uncharted territory in how you live. You are the creator of your destiny. In the chapters of this book, I will share with you techniques that will change the way you live life from this moment forward. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you to Bruce Lipton who first introduced me to the terminology of epigenetics. It was this clarity that reinforced all the things I had been doing throughout my childhood and early adult life. I will go into more on this in the following chapters of the book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am not a scientist or biologist by trade or profession. I perceive myself as being open minded to all things. I lean towards the world of metaphysics which cultivates a direct line of communication with the Divine Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is contained in the chapters of this book are my personal experiences and what I have come to know as my True Identity, My Truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
