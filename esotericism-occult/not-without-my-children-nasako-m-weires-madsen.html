  <title>Not Without My Children - Nasako M. Weires-Madsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Children are &quot;a blessing&quot; from God &quot;Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you; before you were born, I dedicated you&quot; (Jeremiah 1:5). Margaret feels overwhelmed with all that is happening in her life: loosing her home, trying her best to nurture a good relationship with her children while guiding them on the right path of holiness, dealing with her husbands new job of 7 days a week and 24 hours a day, the economic issue the United States is undergoing, and now, a sudden secession from the Federated States of Micronesia and the Compact of Free Association with the United States proposed by her home states elected government officials. If the secession were to go through, it is very likely Margaret will be deported from the United States soil. If that were to happen, what about her U.S citizen young children and her American husband of 21 years? Margaret feels her husband can manage without her, but she must fight to be with her children at all cost. &quot;These are my children, flesh of my flesh, bone of my bones, and blood of my blood; they are my responsibility, my love and my life. My government can either take me to jail or take my life, but it can never take me away from my children&quot; Margaret cried herself to sleep while petitioning God to intervene recalling a dream she had had some years ago where she saw the future 1st African American President of the United States, U.S President Barak Obama, and where he politically stands on the prolife issue, particularly abortion. When we are talking about abortion, we are talking about children and how much they mean to us. Children are created by God for a reason. From her dream, Margaret is convinced, God calls certain individuals into the political and government arena to serve, care for and protect human life as their primary duty. On the other hand, the peoples duty is to keep their elected government leaders in their prayers, for their task can be overwhelming!&lt;/p&gt;" />
