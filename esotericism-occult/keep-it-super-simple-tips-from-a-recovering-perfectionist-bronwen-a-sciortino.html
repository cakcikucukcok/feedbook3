  <title>Keep It Super Simple: Tips from a Recovering Perfectionist - Bronwen A Sciortino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m exhausted! Life wasn&amp;#39;t meant to be easy! I need a break!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of us trudge through our lives believing that we have no control over what happens to us, and that we must make the &amp;#39;best of our lot&amp;#39;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Society teaches us we can have everything we want - but it comes at a price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our world has gone crazy! There&amp;#39;s no formal definition of success - yet we&amp;#39;re all driven to achieve it; be it; obtain it; own it. And we get there by being everything, to everyone all whilst being the busiest person on the planet. How do we know when we have enough?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We take on the world - but we often end up leaving ourselves behind. Our lives are so complex when simplicity will do. As children we&amp;#39;re taught what&amp;#39;s right, wrong, acceptable and unacceptable by our families, friends, schools, communities and the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BUT WHAT IF THEY&amp;#39;RE WRONG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiring individuals to live their lives by the mantra of &amp;#39;Keep It Super Simple&amp;#39; (KISS), Bronwen Sciortino leads you on a journey that challenges the status quo, raises consciousness and helps people to wake up to how different their lives can be. Combining simplicity and wissdom (KISSdom), laughter, tears and simple steps for changing your way forward, Bronwen will change the way you look at your life, and how you choose to live every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will be inspired to step outside the norm and reverse the current life trends, simplify your life and find ways to bring back the fun, laughter and imagination that has vanished over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
