  <title>Ghostly Photographs - Julie Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;This phenomenal collection of photographs, coupled with the stories which illuminate each image, will enrich any reader&#39;s mind with deeply thought-provoking concepts. What Julie Griffin has captured on film is equally compelling and significant. It will prove to be an outstanding contribution to a supernatural conversation occurring worldwide.&quot;

The spirit world is constantly around us; they dont wait until the middle of the night. I have photographed spirit energy as early as 11:30 in the morning, outdoors on a clear sunny day in May.
Learn out about the full body apparitions that were captured indoors by the camera not once, but twice as they moved.
My travels have taken me to the Lizzie Borden House, Gettysburg, Rolling Hills Asylum, Eastern State Penitentiary, an amazing haunted B&amp;B in NY State, and many other places.   
These are the stories behind the photographs and what happened on the investigations. I have experienced objects physically moved by an unknown source, a frightened spirit rush out of a basement and pass through the right side of my body, plus a disembodied male voice whos comment was directed at me.
And an unexpected message given by a Medium from a friends late husband. I was told a list of many items to tell her about, including a broken gravy boat. 
So enjoy these real ghost encounters from the comfort of your favorite chair. They are ghost stories you can see with your own eyes." />
