  <title>‘1’: the Ultimate Foundation of Nature - Orest Bedrij</title>
      <meta name="description" content="********** BACK COVER TEXT **********
1: The Ultimate Foundation of Nature may very well be the most important conceptual breakthrough in the prediction, validation, and unification of physics. It provides solutions to challenges posed by the greatest minds of all time. 
Eugene Wigner of Princeton University, 1963 Nobel laureate in physics, stated, The full meaning of life, the collective meaning of all human desires, is fundamentally a mystery beyond our grasp . . . We have no right to expect that our intellect can formulate perfect concepts for the full understanding of inanimate natures phenomena.
Max Planck from the University of Berlin, 1918 Nobel laureate in physics, declared, Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And it is because in the last analysis we ourselves are part of the mystery we are trying to solve.
In 1: The Ultimate Foundation of Nature, we suggest that you have in your hands the solution for the ultimate mystery of nature that has no explanations in terms of deeper principles. It is based on the laws of physics, the unchanging frame of reference, the 1, predicting, validating, and unifying different laws and theories in a seamless, all-embracing theory of everything.
Some Earlier Reviews on Books by Orest Bedrij
By integrating spiritual validations with scientific evidence, placing one upon the other in verification after verification, Orest Bedrij arrives at an amalgam of the one single fundamental concept: 1 . . . a holy vision of you, the nature of God, and the theory of everything.
Dr. Tibor Horvath, SJ, Professor Emeritus, University of Toronto;
Founder/General Editor, Ultimate Reality and Meaning
This book is an important stepping-stone to a quantum jump in evolution, a world of oneness, which is in the making under our very eyes. May this book inspire leaders to catch up with the sages of our times, who are revealing to us the fundamental oneness of humanity and all creation. 
Dr. Robert Muller, Chancellor of the United Nations University for Peace;
Former Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations
Here is a manual for raising the human dimension and struggle to its cosmic significance. Its encyclopedic scope and depth is the product of a lifetime of dedicated study. Orest Bedrij brings fresh light to the Divine disguise in time . . . The book turns into the coinage of everyday parlance.
Dr. Glen A. Olds, Former President of Kent State University;
US Ambassador to the UN Economic and Social Counsel
