  <title>Things You Probably Didn&#39;t Learn in Church - Jerry Blount</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a Bible researcher and teacher of over forty years, I have noticed that there are certain topics in the Bible that most Christians know little, if anything, about.  For instance, do you think heaven will be a boring place? Many Christians do, so why would they be looking forward to going there? Learn the real facts. Do you know the next prophecy to be fulfilled will be the Rapture, when Christ will return to take the believers home to heaven. Many Biblical scholars believe this will happen soon. You need to be ready. Are you aware that there is an unbelievable amount of evidence that proves that Jesus lived, was crucified, and rose again.  The Bible contains information that could not have been written without divine inspiration, including advanced knowledge about nature, prophecy, medicine, sanitation and science; knowledge that was thousands of years ahead of its time.  Fulfilled prophecy and archaeology discoveries are proving the scriptures to be true. The effects of Satan and his demons are all around usbroken marriages, depression, private doubts about God, divided churches. You need to be aware of his tactics. Are angels involved in our everyday lives? Do you have your own guardian angel? These questions and many, many more are answered in this book. Many years ago I asked God to give me a hunger for His word. He honored that request far more than I anticipated. I truly enjoy studying, researching, and sharing the scriptures. God has blessed my wife and myself in so many ways. We live in a beautiful part of the country, Michigans Upper Peninsula. God has also blessed us with a great son and daughter, their spouses and the four greatest granddaughters ever. I am a blessed man!&lt;/p&gt;" />
