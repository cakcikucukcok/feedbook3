  <title>Loves Impressions - Kenneth Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kenneth Alexander masterfully has crafted Loves Impressions. A Spiritual Poetry Collection of 12 divinely inspired poems. Each poem transcends you to a higher place while allowing you to grow your love and humility for yourself and others as you remain earthbound. Take a journey through heavens gate, discover that the sun shines in all of us, and experience love like you never have before. Cuddle up with your loved one and recite a poem in a tender moment, to touch their heart or simply to say, I love you. If you are a believer or seeker in law of attraction, enlightenment and spiritual growth, these poems will uplift you and inspire you to love yourself, God, and others to new heights.&lt;br /&gt;
What other authors are saying:&lt;br /&gt;
Ken has a remarkably rare talent. Hes able to capture the elusive feelings we all share that too often slip through our minds and hearts before we truly enjoy them. He makes the complex obvious and the simple even sweeter. &lt;br /&gt;
Mike Dooley, NY Times bestselling author of Infinite Possibilities&lt;br /&gt;
Loves Impressions is a beautiful series of 12 poems that leads us through new view points of love and its essential role in life. &lt;br /&gt;
