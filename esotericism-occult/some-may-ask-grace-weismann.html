  <title>Some May Ask - Grace Weismann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Come into my heart and journey with me as I share the story of Emma. It is an amazing tale of faith, hope, and love interwoven into the lives of two families and one very special child. This story is a touching illustration of the miraculous work of God, the great choreographer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am GG, which stands for Grandma Grace. Its a name I dearly treasure because it was given to me by a family whom I have grown to love as my own. Besides being mother to four beautiful daughters, I am GG to Emma and the parents God chose for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anyone had told me that my dream of being a grandmother would have followed this path, Im not sure I would have believed it. Its not a path I would have chosen on my own, to be sure, for it was not always an easy path. Yet it was a journey that was unimaginably rich, for God was present every step of the way. There were many blessings on this path, and the gift at the end of the journey was priceless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is my story &lt;/p&gt;" />
