  <title>My Daze of Brain Injury - Robin J. Bloom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Robin inspires as she shares her stories of brain and spinal injuries. Robins horrors of the unknown and recovery are challenges that all survivors face, especially those who encounter a brain injury. Her journey can be summed up by saying, Tragedy  opened doors to happiness I never suspected. A mustread for brain injury survivors and their families to better understand this long and tiresome recovery process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brenna Meixner, MOT, OTR/L&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupational Therapist, Brain Injury Survivor, Author&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin Bloom offers a very personal glimpse into the journey that she has faced following major trauma. This work provides a raw and gripping account of her experience and the inner events that helped her survive and rebuild herself. This account will expand your understanding of the human response to a major life changing event and offers triumph from the ashes of a personal disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D. Greg Anderson, MD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professor, Department of Orthopedic Surgery,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Jefferson University&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rothman Institute&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robins life changes within a split-second of a tragic accident. The ER finds no visible injuries or broken bones. Yet, confusion and memory loss begin to surface. She emerges from the trauma and finds the life she remembers no longer exists. In a role reversal, this special-needs teacher finds herself a student of her own skills. How Robin discovers and accepts her limitations, and reconciles these life-changing losses, is a story of love, courage and inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;ROBIN J. BLOOM, a first-time author, is a graduate with a BS in Special Education, Elementary Education, and a MEd in Counseling. As a survivor of multiple brain injuries, she is an inspirational writer. Robin resides in Phoenix, Arizona. Visit her website at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.robinjbloom.com&quot;&gt;http://www.robinjbloom.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
