  <title>Life, Habitat and Peace - Prof. Fani Bhusan Das</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is addictive. But every world citizen seeks to acquire the wisdom of life. The story of LIFE, HABITAT, PEACE never have been written had it not been directed by the Supreme Energy-The God to tell the humanity about the ONENESS of his creation, The inner motivation and hope of positive energy have gifted me with HIS love. The conditions of present Habitat have always challenged me to work with Life connecting Habitat and Peace. Life makes Habitat. Habitat makes life. I searched for unification of Life &amp; Habitat to arrive at the end result of Peace. It is a responsibility of all world citizens to participate and share in this search exercise.  With Peace, Life &amp; Habitat are navigated smoothly and sustainably with directives to preserve and conserve Land, Water, Air as formed by the creator.
Life is not a barrel of laughs. It is one laugh at a time. You must assemble your own barrel and put the laugh with happy and peace as you progress onward in your life.
 Read the innovative book of ONENESS to realize the joys and turmoil of life living in the Habitat and search for Peace, the ultimate reality of human civilization. You will find it. Spread the message across the world so that peace prevails on earth through blending of Life &amp; Habitat." />
