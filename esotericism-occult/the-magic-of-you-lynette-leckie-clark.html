  <title>The Magic of You - Lynette Leckie-Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Through knowledge comes understanding, and understanding releases fear.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ascended Master Kuthumi&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This guide seeks to help you learn the true secrets of energy and unlock your unlimited potential. The wisdom the ancient wise ones have always known is now given to you here. For more than twenty five years Lynette Leckie-Clark has been working with spirit guides, Arch Angels and the Ascended Masters and is now the chosen channel of the Ascended Master Kuthumi. Here she shares insight and inspiration to help you become all you can be on your journey through this life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can discover the wisdom of the ancient wise ones. You can find your passion in life, honour the still voice within, use the light rays, and build your light quotient. Through the lessons shared here, you can emerge with a renewed, positive sense of confidence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn about your three minds and the four steps to life abundance, and be inspired by powerful affirmations that can motivate you each and every day. Reach new heights of quantum consciousness with the meditations and higher knowledge shared in this life-transforming handbook, created to guide mankind to finally step into a new way of thinking, The Magic of You explains your role in creating a happier lifestyle for yourself and others. You can begin living a new Earth! As above, so below. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a wonderful and inspiring book this is. To read it is to discover fresh affirmations at every turn. Then I would see examples of an appropriate situation where I could apply what I had read; or at least be reminded of the affirmation. Then if I acted to do the right thing, I had a positive reinforcement. No matter the source of each page (Lynette or Kuthumi) I plan to reread this many times.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Paul Whelan, Dallas, USA&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will always be deeply grateful to Lynette and Master Kuthumi for being there to provide that connection for enormous soul growth, to help us find clarity on our path and to show us those areas in ourselves which are in need of work. So follow your heart and accept this great gift. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Phillippa&lt;/em&gt;, Perth, Western Australia&lt;/p&gt;" />
