  <title>Thinking on Purpose - Neil Paton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is there a secret that some people seem to know about and use in creating lives that are overflowing with success and abundance? The answer is absolutely yes. Over the years, its been proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, and yet surprisingly, it remains a mystery to most to this very day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the consequences of our environment, and although we may not recognize the underlying forces influencing our lives each day, the fact is we are all playing a rolefor the most part unconsciouslyin creating the outcomes that make up our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our thoughts create our feelings, our feelings create our actions, and our actions create our outcomes. Indirectly, yet surely, we alone are ultimately responsible for the outcomes of our lives through the thoughts we have chosen to emotionally connect with. The silver lining is that we also all have within our reach the ability to directly create new outcomes for a future that is limited only by the thoughts we choose from this day forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only through learning how to consistently make constructive thought choices can we begin to make a difference in our lives and in the lives of those around us. Join me on a personal journey, learning the so-called secrets and making them work for you in creating the life of your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A brand-new world awaits. Why not come and start building it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
