  <title>Dancing with the Dolphin - Kathy Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The authors search for healing takes her on an excursion to exotic placesa tropical island, the frozen North, a Turkish harem. The mystery of such scenes and some puzzling dreams lead her to a spiritually attuned psychologist who practices past-life regression. A lovely dolphin spirit guide accompanies her on her journey, while words of wisdom from an inspirational inner voice help guide her way. This true story reads like a diary, flows like fiction.
A brilliant look into the intuitive mind of a woman longing for connection, understanding and ultimately, love. Raw, honest and from the heart.
- Susan Mushkin, educator, writer, editor
Dancing with the Dolphin is a delightful read. Very few writers have the ability to make an inner journey as compelling as an action-adventure story, but Kathy Schmidt accomplished that in this fast-paced, fun read through an incredible story that is both earthy and transcendental. Highly recommended!
