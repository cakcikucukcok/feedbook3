  <title>When I Meditate: Reclaiming a Key Facet of Prayer - Art Toalston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I Meditate conveys this central message: It&amp;#39;s good to pray and it&amp;#39;s good to meditate.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some Christians find this hard to believe. They know that meditation is mentioned in the Bible, but they tend to think it is a practice that belongs in other religions. When I Meditate sets forth a winsome alternative &amp;ndash; a Scripture-based, you-can-do-it understanding of meditation as a life-changing facet of prayer. Within a biblical context, When I Meditate relays an array of insights and illustrations for an enlivened readiness to pray &amp;ndash; and to follow Jesus, through the Holy Spirit, into tender communion with the Father and to live out his message of redemption in a world of needy souls.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Compared to religions and techniques that center on meditation, mantras, and physical postures for emptying one&amp;#39;s soul into an impersonal cosmos, Christian meditation, in its all-important uniqueness as described in When I Meditate, entails God&amp;#39;s use of Scripture to transform our minds and hearts. The riches of Scripture, when set in motion by prayer and meditation, can address any human need or yearning. Even one Scripture passage when memorized &amp;ndash; and re-memorized as need be &amp;ndash; and then internalized through meditation can be a catalyst for personal renewal and for conveying God&amp;#39;s grace by word and deed to anyone, near or far, who yearns for a vibrant faith." />
