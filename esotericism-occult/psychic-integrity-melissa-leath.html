  <title>Psychic Integrity - Melissa Leath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a fresh and incisive book, &lt;i&gt;Psychic Integrity&lt;/i&gt; probes the esoteric world of communicating with spirit beings and psychic phenomena. Mystifying concepts are explained in straightforward ways so the general public, as well as clients and novice psychics, can understand and become familiar with them. A major portion of the book takes you through the development process of becoming a reliable and honest psychic or medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do mediums really speak to the dead?&lt;BR&gt;
Are psychics really able to divine the future, &lt;BR&gt;
or do they use a parlor trick called cold reading? &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Find out now.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once highly respected and revered, the age-old tradition of divination is now often ridiculed as fraudulent. Deception, ego, greed, and ignorance have given the term psychic a bad reputation. Its time to change that perception. This book, as a guide for high standards of integrity, brings back the honor and reverence of psychics and mediums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rev. Melissa Leath has taken an often misunderstood subject and brought it into the NOW with sensible words, forthright honesty and wisdom. Thank you Rev. Leath for illuminating a subject that has long needed it and for doing it with integrity and professionalism.&lt;BR&gt;
- Tammi WyndRavin Rager, &lt;i&gt;numerologist to the stars and radio talk show host&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; In the field of Psychics, Intuitives, Channelers and Mediums, Melissa Leath proves she has deep Psychic Integrity and has produced a well-documented book that educates the public. Buyer Beware is now ... Buyer Be Aware. Read this book today if you are a seeker of truth on all dimensions! &lt;BR&gt;
- Liz Sterling &lt;i&gt;of Sterling Communication Services, radio talk show host&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Thank you, Melissa, for your hard work and commitment in making this important book available to the practitioners in our industry. &lt;BR&gt;
