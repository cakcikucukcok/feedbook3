      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Hearts Desire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Palsy I am not being for people with and without a disability. My hearts desire is to reach people of all ages, origins, and
race. I want to ensure that there is a soul saved through my testimony. My main focus now is to change the hearts and minds of people and people who are disabled and the ones with disabilities. There may be people out there with this disease that is confused about it or is questioning God about it. In this book, you will find how I found clarity, and understanding on how to cope with it, and make a difference no matter who I was. People sometimes hurt us with the words that they say, because they do not have the full knowledge and understanding of this disease. Staying positive with both my attitude and my emotions helps me to stay focus on the plan that God has for my life. I want to guide people on how they should treat a person with a disability because sometimes its misunderstood or how to handle people with a disability. People with disability will learn how to live their lives as God extended them to live while getting closer to him." />
