  <title>Your Magnetic Heart: 10 Secrets of Attraction, Love and Fulfillment - Ruediger Schache</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Most people have the same fundamental yearnings and questions inside of them. Most of us agree, the most common desire by far is to love and to be loved. And yet for so many people, love - in its many forms - poses the most difficult challenge of all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Your Magnetic Heart&lt;/I&gt; reveals the nature of the mysterious force of charisma and attraction which is present in us all and which determines the course of our relationships and our lives. German seminar leader, life-coach and author Ruediger Schache introduces the spiritual and psychological concept of the &quot;heart magnet&quot; and how readers can attune themselves and get in touch with it to find their true life path. This important process is explained by revealing ten essential secrets which emphasize self-reflection. The description of each secret is accompanied by practical advice, a number of real-life case histories, and insights from age-old and new spiritual figures, seers and thinkers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Those who embrace these concepts can develop a new consciousness and improve their inner clarity, outer relationships, and fortune. By understanding the force of the heart magnet within them, readers can learn to attract precisely those people and events into their lives that they have been longing for.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
