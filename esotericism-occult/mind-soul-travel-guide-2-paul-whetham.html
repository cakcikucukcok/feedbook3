  <title>Mind &amp; Soul Travel Guide 2 - Paul Whetham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just when you think it&amp;rsquo;s game over &amp;ndash; it&amp;rsquo;s game on! In this 2nd mind &amp;amp; soul travel guide Dr Whetham encourages you to move out of your comfort zone and to go deeper into mystery and meaning. He suggests that Plan B adventure is when things go right &amp;ndash; not wrong! We are all built for adventure. Join us for a real journey of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soul Food Cafe&amp;rsquo;s three Mind &amp;amp; Soul Travel Guides are designed to renew your mind and soul. We lead you on an adventure using &amp;lsquo;tell, show, do&amp;rsquo; education principles. In Travel Guide 1 we tell you about the 3 levels of existence using existentialism (Aesthetic, Ethical, Religious/Spiritual), the 3 minds in neuroscience (Chaotic, Contemplative, Compassionate) and propose a DSM guide for the soul (Despair, Suffering, Meaning). In Travel Guide 2 we show you the journey of discovery using personal insights and the psychology of meaning-making. In Travel Guide 3 we draw on some of the great Christian thinkers to help you move from old way to new way. Welcome aboard!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our Mind and Soul Travel Guide series (3 books) accompany the Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; online courses. Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; is an organisation who aims to promote spiritual health as a pathway to mental health. At Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; we believe it is possible to find beauty, meaning and purpose in a seemingly broken world. And our soul is tough and tenacious enough to find it. We provide a safe space for stories, skills and support to flourish. By exploring how our smaller story intersects with our soul story we give voice to the deeper things of the mind and soul that will help you to thrive, not just survive. The basic idea of Soul Food Caf&amp;eacute; is to transform existing community caf&amp;eacute;s into informal sacred spaces where we reflect, connect and grow with others. Our caf&amp;eacute;s are also community training spaces where we use three core courses to deepen our self-awareness, spirituality and listening skills, to assist others who are soul searching. We take you on a journey of discovery where you will be coached by others and, in turn, become a coach to others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We offer a number of well-being resources that are designed to renew your mind and soul:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Mind &amp;amp; Soul Travel Guides (3 Books): 1. Journey of Discovery, 2. Built for Adventure, 3. Soul Talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Journey of Discovery Courses: 1. Self-Discovery, 2. Shared Discovery, 3. Discovery Coach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;bull; Optional Courses: 1. Retrain My Brain, 2. Brain-Based Resilience Training, 3. Soul Searching.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information, visit &lt;strong&gt;www.soulfood.cafe.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
