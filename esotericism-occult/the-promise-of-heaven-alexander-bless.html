  <title>The Promise of Heaven - Alexander Bless</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most Christians are familiar with only a few selected verses of the Bible that are repeated endlessly without much understanding. &lt;I&gt;The Promise of Heaven&lt;/I&gt; points out the lesser-known dark and morbid aspects of the Bible that congregations never hear from religious leaders. &lt;B&gt;Alexander Bless&lt;/B&gt; asks controversial questions for believers as well as non-believers to consider.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;-What was God doing before creation?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If God created everything out of nothing (Gen.1:1) did he exist in the middle of nothing?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Was He the only &quot;something&quot; in nothing?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;-In the flood story God destroyed humans as punishment for their sins. Why did He also destroy animals?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;-Why did God create humans with all their human failings and then punish them for it?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;-Why do you have to fear God?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;How can you love God if you fear Him?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Curiosity is a natural instinct of mankind that drives it to learn and to progress. Paul says in I.Corin.13: 11(DRB) &quot;When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But, when I became a man, I put away the things of a child.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;" />
