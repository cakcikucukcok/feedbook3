  <title>Unleash Your Subconscious Mind Power: 8 Habits of The Mindynamics System Practitioners - Andy Soh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people have been trying to explain the power of the subconscious mind through books and seminars for more than a century. Different writers approached this subject at different angles and most of them did not achieve their expected results as most readers did not really understand the concept or were not really convinced with what they have read. This book comes with a unique intention of helping you to achieve anything you really want and equally important, getting rid of anything you do not want. This is done by optimizing your subconscious mind power through The Mindynamics System.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;During those years of application and practice, I have managed to find out more about the subconscious mind: what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t; and why. I have also created The Mindynamics System that explains clearly why and how the subconscious mind works. The theories and techniques I have covered in this book do aligned with what &amp;quot;The Secret&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;The Law of Attraction&amp;quot; teach. There may be some differences in techniques and perspectives; but the principles are the same.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have found the codeword for motivation and I am now sharing with you. With the new challenges in the 21st century, I believe the codeword for motivation &amp;mdash; The Subconscious Mind will be the deciding factor for success as the subconscious mind does magic and create miracles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With this book, I will show you the techniques to unleash the power of your subconscious mind through The Mindynamics System. You will be able to BE YOUR BEST and achieve your goals. Be pleasantly rewarded, as the results you attain are fast, efficient and permanent." />
