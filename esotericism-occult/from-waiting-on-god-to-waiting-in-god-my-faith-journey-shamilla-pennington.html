  <title>From Waiting on God to Waiting in God—My Faith Journey - Shamilla Pennington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life happens and can occasionally throw us the unexpected. We find ourselves thinking, I didnt ask for any of this. From Waiting on God to Waiting in God will allow you to journey with a mother who finds herself in this very predicament.
What are you waiting on in this season of your life?
 Are you waiting on a call-back from a job interview?
 Waiting on your unemployment to be verified?
 Are you waiting for test results or healing?
 Do you feel like your back is against the wall?
 Is life throwing the unexpected at you and your family?
If you have answered YES to any of the above or youre currently facing a situation that causes you to wonder if God has forsaken you, then stop! Look no further and allow Shamilla Pennington to take you on a journey while she speaks truth and breathes hope into your circumstances. Dont throw in the towel just yet. Help is just around the bend. Youre only a prayer away from the blessings that will change your life, as you learn what it means to wait in God.
From Waiting on God to Waiting in God illustrates a clear picture and personal story of lifes happenings and events that take one woman and her family from desperately waiting on God to trusting and peacefully waiting in God. Shamillas experiences, transparency, and real humor will encourage you to keep your head up while facing your challenges." />
