  <title>Dreams and their Symbolism - Henry Havelock Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book deals with the stuff that dreams are made of and the symbolism of dreams.“Our dreams begin to seem to us an allied subject of study, inasmuch as they reveal within ourselves a means of entering sympathetically into ideas and emotional attitudes belonging to narrow or ill-adjusted states of consciousness which otherwise we are now unable to experience. And they have this further value, that they show us how many abnormal phenomena—possession, double consciousness, unconscious memory, and so forth—which have often led the ignorant and unwary to many strange conclusions, really have a simple explanation in the healthy normal experience of all of us during sleep. Here, also, it is true that we ourselves and our beliefs are to some extent &quot;such stuff as dreams are made of.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;

Ellis also argues that auto-erotic impulses can be heightened by bodily processes like menstrual flow.<br /><b><i>Havelock Ellis - Wikipedia</i></b> | By HAVELOCK ELLIS T he dramatization of subjective elements of the personality, which contributes so largely to render our dreams vivid and interesting, rests on that dissociation, or falling apart of the constituent groups of psychic centers, which is so fundamental a fact of dream-life.<br /><b><i>Popular Science Monthly/Volume 77/July 1910/The Symbolism ...</i></b> | Dreams and their Symbolism - Henry Havelock Ellis - This book deals with the stuff that dreams are made of and the symbolism of dreams.“Our dreams begin to seem to us an allied subject of study, inasmuch as they reveal within ourselves a means of entering sympathetically into ideas and emotional attitudes belonging to narrow or ill-adjusted states of consciousness which otherwise we are now ...<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Dreams and their Symbolism - Henry Havelock Ellis</a> </h3></p><hr/>
