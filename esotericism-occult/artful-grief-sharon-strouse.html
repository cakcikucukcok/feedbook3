  <title>Artful Grief - Sharon Strouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Artful Grief&lt;/i&gt; is a decade long study of loss by an art therapist, in the aftermath of her daughters suicide. On October 11, 2001, Sharon received a phone call in the middle of the night from the New York City Police Department telling her that her seventeen year old daughter Kristin, had fallen from the roof of her college dormitory. So began her journey into the labyrinth of unspeakable grief. As the ?rst year drew to a close she found no comfort in traditional therapy, and no solace in spoken or written words. In surrender to her inner art therapists guidance, she began to create collages. She cut and tore images out of magazines and glued them on various size paper. The paper was a safe and sacred container,  receptive to the fullness of emotion, story and paradox. Over time there was transformation and healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Artful Grief&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A creative roadmap through violent dying and grief.
A dose of soul medicine for survivors.
A way to retrieve the pieces of a shattered  life, with paper, scissors and glue.
A resourceful tool for those suffering with complicated grief and/or PTSD.
A place for the unspeakable to be seen and heard.
A process to quiet the mind and open the heart.
A visual experience of trauma images as illustrations of hope.
A sample of prophetic dreams and meditations that are  illuminating.
A heartfelt sharing of  intimate secrets for understanding and compassion.
A surprising grief gift that is inspiring.&lt;/p&gt;" />
