  <title>How Did I End Up Here? - Keith Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Why are we the person we are? Why did someone significant enter our life at the precise moment they did? How is it we&amp;rsquo;re naturally attracted to certain people, situations, work, opportunities and not others? Why are we living this life and not another life with different people? And where does God and our spiritual identity fit into it all?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our life seems to be an enigma impossible to unravel. We feel we&amp;rsquo;re living behind a veil, suspecting something more is going on but knowing we&amp;rsquo;re not in on whatever it is. Yet what if there&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;more to us being here? What if we&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;identify the influences that shape the path our life takes? And what if we&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;involved in the selection of those influences?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this, the third book in a channelled series, discarnate guides illuminate the deep aspects of our exist&amp;shy;ence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;When you are born no one knows where precisely your life will lead. There is a plan, but no one either on Earth or in the spiritual realm knows how much of the plan will be realised in a particular life. That is the reason each life keeps everyone involved on their toes. That is the wonder of incarnation. That is its mystery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It is because people are aware a mystery beats at the heart of their life that they question their existence. We say this because, like you, we have lived many lives and so are speaking from experience when we say it is common for people to feel that a veil hides the deepest aspects of their life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our perspective is that by closely examining your life, by looking behind the daily flow of what is happening, it is possible for you to lift the veil, shine a light into the mysterious heart of your existence, and identify the contours of your life as you intended it to be.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
