  <title>Dispelling the Illusions of Aging and Dying - Linda Llc Stein-Luthke, Martin F. Luthke, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The two greatest fears that human beings possess are the fears of aging and dying &amp;ndash; and that is exactly what holds you in the grip of the process of aging and dying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book helps you to realize that every fear you have is illusory. When you move beyond the five senses, you can see these illusions for yourself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you choose to follow the suggestions offered by the Ascended Master St. Germain and heal your fears, you will move into a greater awareness of the only true reality there is: that all is Light &amp;ndash; and that includes you. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our world is changing very rapidly. We show you how to open yourself to a new world in which health and well-being are the natural order of existence. We invite you to join us on a journey to a new paradigm, a life-giving and rejuvenating paradigm that is free from all fear.
