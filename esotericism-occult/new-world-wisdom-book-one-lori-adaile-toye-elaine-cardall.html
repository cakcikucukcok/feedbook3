  <title>New World Wisdom, Book One - Lori Adaile Toye, Elaine Cardall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can we transform our tumultuous society? Is it even possible to save our ailing planet?&lt;br /&gt;
Yes, say the teachings in this book &amp;ndash; channeled wisdom from a team of Ascended Masters, one of whom made his presence known to the young mother and mystic Lori Toye when she least expected it and could do little about it. It took decades to channel, transcribe, and publish the prophecies and counsel in this book, and even more time &amp;ndash; and a second revised printing - for Toye to understand the meaning of the material: Prophecies are not predictions! Such messages are both metaphorical and literal. They are warnings with solutions to avoid what is prophesied. The chapters in this book contain information that explains how human consciousness has the ability to change and transform, and how this microcosmic effect literally extends &amp;ndash; guiding social and cultural values, physically reshaping the planet&amp;#39;s weather, sensitive ecosystems, and geography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yes, we can change &amp;ndash; by accepting our spiritual virtue and innate goodness; by learning to consciously cultivate the &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twelve Jurisdictions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, shared by the spiritual teachers; by engaging in our own personal Ascension process. The Spiritual Teachers who contributed their &lt;em&gt;Wisdom&lt;/em&gt; call this process the &amp;ldquo;BE-coming.&amp;rdquo; Be. Come. Add you effort to engender the growth of a new global, cultural consciousness &amp;ndash; the Golden Age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lori Toye is known for the best-selling &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I AM America Earth Changes Maps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, which introduced spiritual teachings of prophecy and the Time of Change. Her initial work was published more than twenty years ago before public awareness of the serious environmental issues of Global Warming and Climate Change. Lori&amp;#39;s work has been featured on NBC, FOX, UPN, London&amp;#39;s Carlton Television, in the Washington Post and the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
