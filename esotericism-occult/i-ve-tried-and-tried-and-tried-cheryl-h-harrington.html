  <title>I’Ve Tried and Tried and Tried - Cheryl H. Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If this is a fair world, Cheryl H. Harrington would have most likely not written this book. This book is a thrilling story about the struggles and hardships that she has been through in this cold, hard world. It goes from the ever so loving happiness of a family, to the deepest depths of addiction. Her story is one for the history books, but also a story that tells of the strength and passion of a black woman who dreams to be successful in this world today. Not everyone can overcome the challenges she has faced in her life, but as a strong black woman in this unforgiving world, Cheryl has made a name for herself. This story here tells how that name came about. 
In life God provides you with chances, opportunities, situations, circumstances, and people....for a reason or a season Sometimes both. The author of this book has not written these words for entertainment, they are authentic. This is her story. I know because God has loaned her to me for quite a season now and i recognize the reason...This story being shared is one of true revelation of the meaning of a deep and loving relationship with our Divine Higher Power and most be-loved God! The courage,strength, wisdom, sincerity this soldier of the Lord has chosen to share will help those wandering in the dark to look deeper, harder and longer at the choices they have made and whom they have served within and without their struggles through life....Riveting book....awesome, metaphorically intertwined in the complex and compelling struggle Christians experienced while carry our cross...Amazing!!!!!!!!!
