  <title>Visions of Turmoil and Eternal Rest - Ebenezer A. Belete, Warren A. Shipton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most fascinating periods of history must certainly be around the time of Daniel the prophets time (sixth and fifth centuries B.C.). It was then that many of the philosophies that were to exert a telling influence on Western thought and Christianity arose. This is the period when Buddha, Confucius, Lao-Tzu, Zoroaster and Pythagoras developed their ideas.
In this book, we consider the coded messages written by Daniel and later by the apostle John (preserved in the Bible). History offers outstanding confirmation of the accuracy of their predictions. We indicate how past and developing world events fit into the fabric of prophecy." />
