  <title>On Top of Beacon Hill - Brannon Gerling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On Top of Beacon Hill&lt;/i&gt; presents a homecoming of art and philosophy in verse. Powered in the tradition of existential thought, the phenomenological composition seeks to transport readers to the fertile and authentic realm of elemental being through a rare blend of Eastern, Western, and indigenous styles. Learn how to express your emotions fearlessly, and with excellent distinction. Make your spiritual ends meet, gloriously, inducing shamanic-trained impeccability from your actions, and appreciating, most intimately, the causal force of eternity, Nietzsches eternal recurrence. Packaged tightly with semantics, but never shackled by them, the poems explore some classic topical clashes within Eastern and Western thought. But in a word: a simple yet austere program to power, to cognitively fill out the authority of your sensory capacity, indeed, philosophically pioneering the mental charge of emotionsnot governing but engaging themlike hound dogs leading the hunt, as we sow raw and timeless seeds &lt;i&gt;On Top of Beacon Hill&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Language is Contradiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In time, language seeks negation dialectically, as the right leg seeks the left for movement. In the utilization to articulate ideas, contradictions become apparent, because correspondence is a stack of letters, cogently fashioned from wild thoughts for fermentation of domestication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language exists now, yet requires structural reflection and afterthought, both of which are peripheral thoughts in Platonic forms of thinking inside immediacy. And that which seems coupled from a distance (here vernacular forms with immediacy) defines via contradistinction. So, language is the nativity of dialectics, since it is acting definition, plus possession: clutching at building materials, some sentimental reflection of yesteryear, and the flux of the thoughts of the morrow &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
