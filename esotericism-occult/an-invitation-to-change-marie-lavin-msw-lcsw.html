  <title>An Invitation to Change - Marie Lavin Msw Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Years ago, I was experiencing symptoms of a serious illness, so I began searching for another modality to provide deeper healing on every level. I rediscovered Energy Healing and found an enlightened practitioner who helped bring me into healthy balance. Through our work, I discovered that I held a gift for this kind of healing within myself. In retrospect, I feel that my inner wisdom guided me to this place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I work to heal others by teaching them the critical importance of bringing their minds, bodies, and spirits into balance, helping them to remove the inner blocks theyre holding subconsciously which interfere with true health and happiness, and guiding them to the wholeness each of us is capable of attaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my energy healing sessions, I receive information through an intuitive process I cant describe, but which is present nonetheless. I can only call it divine guidance, directing me to understand just where the clients issues reside within his or her body or mind. Through gentle phrases or an occasional touch, I guide clients to a relaxed and tranquil state where they can safely release the burdensome thoughts or behaviors that no longer serve them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
