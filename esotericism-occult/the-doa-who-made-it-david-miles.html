  <title>The Doa Who Made It! - David Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It was a warm, sunny, Tuesday afternoon. I was waiting at the red light at a busy interchange when another motorcycle pulled up next to me, in the same lane, also now waiting to go home, or to a friends house, or maybe shopping. The very next thing he did was watch me fly like a circus aerial act, bouncing off car roof tops, and sailing all the way across the huge intersection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no prior intention, I was on my way to meet my maker and face up to the life that I had been living until thenall initiated by a drunk in an old, four-door sedan who had no plans on even slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resuscitated over and over on the asphalt, I was eventually rushed to the hospital, where my wife was repeatedly told that I would not be alive much longer. Not being a believer of that kind of talk, she took peace in her heart that I would survive to be with her and our two little boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, having been comatose for two weeks, I awoke frightened and was told that I had little hope of much of a recovery. I was then confronted with Jesus himself, right there in that hospital room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What He asked me over and over at that point clarified my beliefs and gave me the confidence to continue on. I call that encounter a pure miracle and thank God that I was The DOA Who Made It!&lt;/p&gt;" />
