  <title>Thanks for the Lemons - Annette L. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its all about Communication. Its lack of presence, its abuse and misuseI am writing this book because I love communicatingto learn and know how best to apply the appropriate words to benefit and expand our lives and relationships: to learn how to choose the correct words with the intended emphasis so our voices are un-mistakenly heard and our needs metwords. Interpretations. Communication one on one. Enjoy the smorgasbord of words available to us all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lemons? A metaphor to prepare me for that game [of Life]taught me how to take what life put in my way and obtain the tools with which to find, before its too late, how to make the best of the worstand as I have shared with you some of my experiences and accompanying anecdotes [youll see] I have lived the life out of life! with the aid of heightened communication skills, renewed spirituality and reestablished love came this manuscript&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Words. I love them. I love stringing them together; playing with them on paper or screen to make a point, deliver a message, express a thought, make someone smile, even laugh when the right words are strung together effectively. I love talking. Words. Put them to music and make them rhyme a story. Words. Knowing enough of them to coherently fill a book with thoughts, ideas, opinions all dancing together on 300 or so pages; hopefully not repetitively&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They say, write what you know. I have. And as I wrote, in the hope of fulfilling my books message, I was in search of one word which had exceeded my attention, my grasp. A word that I have known, used and enjoyed but in this forum unable to isolate and shareuntil now.&lt;/p&gt;" />
