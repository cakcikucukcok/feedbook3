  <title>My Journey to Divine Healing - Henry E. Dorsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written from my personal experience with the provisions and principles described in trhe Bible. My personal health problems encountered over the course of my 73 years on this Earth was in part, the reason this book was written. I share my story now in hope that someone will be blessed my the information set to print here. 
   My primary audience is the American Church, from which my Journey began. In my early years,
I was blessed to be a part of the Baptist congregation in Berkeley, California. As time progressed from my exposure to the Gospel in the Church to my actual conversion experience at 12 years old,
many questions arose which were not answered by my Church. In my conversatons with my peers and family, the gap in the questions and answers only got wider. Many of these questions are answered in this book. 
  It is suficent to say, MY JOURNEY TO DIVINE HEALING was my effort to organize my life experiences in such a way as to convey both meaning and structure around existance. It is my belief
that many people have had, and still have the same life experiences and concerns as myself and have not recieved satisfactory answers. It is my intent to shed light on these concerns from a Biblical foundation, with logic, knowledge, undrestanding and wisdom.
   I believe the reader will be rewarded many times over when digesting the content of this Book.
In addition I think the reader will be pleasantly surprised when they begin to do what they learn." />
