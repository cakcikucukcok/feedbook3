  <title>Yoga and Grief - Gloria Drayer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After a great loss, the journey toward healing can be a tempestuous one, a fragile balance of light and dark, hope and despair. For many people the practices of yoga can provide a focus on the present moment and a way to restore the balance and energy which we need so urgently in times of stress and sadness. This book teaches gentle yoga techniques and suggestions about breathing, meditation and ritual, all designed to promote calm and comfort. These techniques are appropriate for those of any age and physical ability, and make sense for those already adept as much as for those completely new to yoga practice.
The authors share valuable insights drawn from their own life experience as well as from Glorias Yoga and Grief workshops, which have helped many participants to get in touch with their own inner strength and spiritual resources. For those on the dark pathway between grieving and healing, this book can shed light and ease the burden." />
