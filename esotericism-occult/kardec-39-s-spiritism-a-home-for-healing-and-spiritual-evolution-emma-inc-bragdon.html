      <meta name="description" content="Especially of interest to those involved with healing and healthcare: The first book to describe contemporary spiritual healing centers in Brazil including a psychiatric hospital where spiritual healers collaborate with conventionally trained healthcare professionals.  There are more than 12,000 of these centers in Brazil; 20-40 million Brazilians use this resource for spiritual growth, healing, and to maintain wellness. These Centers welcome people of all religions and cultures, offering effective forms of healing as a free service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The introduction to the philosophy of Spiritism is presented in a clear, easy to understand manner. The description of the methods for healing used over more than 150 years demonstrate that Brazil has developed an effective model of integrative health care.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author spent half of each year, 2001-2012, in Brazil studying these centers and hospitals.  She is a psychologist, teacher, prolific author and pioneer in the area of healing and spiritual awakening.  She suggests that importing components of Brazil&amp;#39;s Spiritist Centers could help us improve our ailing healthcare system." />
