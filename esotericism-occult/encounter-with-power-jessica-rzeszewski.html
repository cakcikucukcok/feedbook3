  <title>Encounter with Power - Jessica Rzeszewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Power is a force that permeates the life of anyone on the journey toward perceptual freedom. It is a topic that also permeates literature on how to follow the Toltec tradition. But nowhere has Power been dealt with in such a singular and straightforward fashion by an everyday warrior/sorcerer who has made the journey of perceptual freedom the driving force of her life. Approaching the subject of Power in such a direct fashion in order for the reader to do the same is the aim of Encounter with Power. A Journey from the Toltec Perspective.   
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Because every warrior/sorcerer encounters Power without fail, the trick is in recognizing who, what, where, when and how to deal with this force when it shows itself. The fact that Power becomes evident can easily become eclipsed by its slippery, seductive nature and the oftentimes tumultuous impact it can have on the life of the warrior/sorcerer. Making decisions and taking action therefore become imperative. How then does the warrior/sorcerer proceed. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
How the warrior/sorcerer takes on Power as a bona fide opponent that needs to be challenged, defeated, and then commanded at will, is at the heart of this book. Encounter with Power: A Journey from the Toltec Perspective is the chronicle of one woman&#39;s experience of challenging Power head on. The challenge to do the same subsequently transfers to the reader. An invitation to action is woven throughout the book and is designed to propel the reader into their own definitive encounter with Power.
