  <title>Are We There Yet? - Marcie Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While studying in India, the ancient spiritual knowledge revealed to me that everything in this creation is made up of and is under the control of The Five Elements. Countless ancient traditions and civilizations have pointed to the greatness, profundity, and perfection of nature. It was through the combination of my fire element, my passion, and my will power, as well as the meditation and purification practices given to me by my guru Kaleshwar that resulted in a silence and peace deep within me. I began to have experiences that grew quickly and did not leave me. They built themselves, one upon another, revealing to me that I had become reconnected and reintroduced to the peace and information inside of The Five Elements. When I was able to reconnect to this vast and powerful inner silence through The Five Elements and through the unbelievable patience and grace of my teacher, it felt like opening a vault with limitless amounts of energy and unconditional love. It was a process where layers and layers of doubt, fear, sadness, pain, anger, judgment, and confusion were removed. This process required a lot of journaling, meditation, and shedding of my ego and lots of waterproof mascara." />
