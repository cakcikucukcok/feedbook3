  <title>My Little Cowboy: My Reincarnation Story - Roger Mendoza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is the true story of a life that Roger once lived that unfolded to him in a very unusual way. While driving to work, the first part came to him as a waking dream lasting little more than a few seconds. Two months later the rest of the story came in a similar way. The odd thing was that these felt more like memories than just two waking dreams.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; In 2005 Roger set out to collect all of his notes and recollections to create My Little Cowboy. It took seven years for Roger to discover all of the connections between that story and his emotionally complicated present life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; This is a book about reincarnation. Roger recounts the story of Alexander Johnson, his wife Martha and his children who lived in the 1800&amp;#39;s. The story focuses on Alexander&amp;#39;s family life from his childhood through his marriage to Martha. It continues as Alexander, Martha and their first son, Alex travel from New York to the West. Things get interesting as Alexander&amp;#39;s family grows and many years later vilainy threatens to destroy his family. After the 1800&amp;#39;s life ends, it continues briefly in the 1940&amp;#39;s and then finally in the 1950&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;" />
