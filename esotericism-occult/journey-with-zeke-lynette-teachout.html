Every decision requires a choice.&lt;br /&gt;
Zeke and Griffen Cook are learning all about choices and the way that the decisions they make impact their friends, their family, and themselves. Each brother is confronting choices in his own way as they both face life-changing challenges and events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zeke, the younger brother, is faced with a choice about what to do concerning a message that he has received from beyond the grave. Even after he makes his decision, signs and messages continue to arrive as he tries to unravel the true meaning of a fiery car crash, a swooping hawk, drugs, alcohol, and a dream that includes being presented with three doors, of which he may choose only one. Will he choose the right door, and what will he find on the other side?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older brother Griffen is faced with life-challenging choices. He wants to make his parents happy, but when he is invited to a party by classmate Devon Clark, he has to choose between making his parents happy and trying to fit in with his classmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the brothers lives interconnect with Devon and a family friend, a secret is revealedone involving choices and decisions to be made with consequences that will impact all of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
