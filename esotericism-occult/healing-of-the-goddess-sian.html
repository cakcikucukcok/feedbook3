  <title>Healing of the Goddess - Sian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sian is an experienced clairaudient, clairvoyant, and clairsentient channel of Light who has dedicated many years of her life to the pursuit of helping others improve theirs. Now, in &lt;i&gt;Healing of the Goddess, &lt;/i&gt;she brings readers within a life-changing experienceand the epiphany that it inspired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After her soul was imploded by a massive psychic force, she developed breast cancer, causing a near-death experience that took fifteen years from her life. As she describes an extraordinary experience in her healing journey, the hand of God encapsulated her soul with Light, giving her the strength and faith to endure long healing process to reinstate her body back to life. She explains how breast cancer was the result of a karmic strike and how the Keys of Transformation allowed her to be healed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer, she has come to understand, is a trial by tribulation. &lt;i&gt;The Healing of the Goddess &lt;/i&gt;explores the cause-and-effect factors that are the real underlyingcauses of disease and recalls Sians journey of self-healing and transformation.The challenge we all face is to truly understand the nature of life, energy, andhealing. If life is to be sustained, the time has come for humanity to fundamentallyaddress our relationship with all life on this glorious planet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an auspicious and providential period in human evolution: Are we enlightened enough to shepherd in a new era of health and peaceor will we condemn it with apathy and ignorance?&lt;/p&gt;" />
