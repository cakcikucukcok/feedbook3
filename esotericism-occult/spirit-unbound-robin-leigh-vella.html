  <title>Spirit Unbound - Robin Leigh Vella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine reaching out to your angels and suddenly finding yourself in a higher place. Imagine having immediate access to universal intelligence whenever you need it - uplifting spiritual guidance that would not only help you to navigate through a challenging moment, but also assist you in healing and transforming your life. Imagine being able to see the world through Spirits eyes. Spirit Unbound offers you more than timeless wisdom for the now; it gives you the power to change your perception of reality.&lt;/p&gt;
Remember your true identity
Reclaim your inner power
Raise your vibration
Re-view the now
Realize your dreams
Recreate your life
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&quot;This is one of those divine books that takes no effort at all to read. My advice would be to just let it fall open at any page it wants to, because whichever page that is, you&#39;ll instantly receive a message vital to your heart and soul. The premise is deceptively simple, and like Robin&#39;s previous book, the result gives you all you&#39;ll ever need to feel spiritually complete.&quot; - Jenny Smedley, best-selling author and Angel Artist. www.jennysmedley.co.uk&lt;/p&gt;" />
