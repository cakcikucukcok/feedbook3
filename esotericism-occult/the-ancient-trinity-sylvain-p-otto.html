  <title>The Ancient Trinity - Sylvain P Otto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Ancient Trinity is presented to the reader in three tomes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume 1 takes on the form of a myth: a series of short stories, ones as old as the illusion of time itself. The myth is meant to be a cognitive exercise whose resolution will invite the reader to construct a logistical framework effectively addressing the concepts presented to him in the subsequent volumes of the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The myth continues in Volume 2: Gofer&amp;rsquo;s Paradox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume 2 is the dissertation&amp;#39;s introduction, and addresses the inaugural question of &amp;ldquo;The Nine Dots Prize&amp;rdquo;; a demonstrably regional literary competition intended for an academic audience, preferred but not officially limited to the ivory tower circuit of southeastern UK. The second tome is meant to be a satirical response to a rhetorical statement masquerading as the inaugural question of The Nine Dots Prize: &amp;ldquo;Are digital technologies making politics impossible&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume 3 is the dissertation proper. It addresses the devolution of the universe: one whose process cycle is devolving from a model based on quantum mechanics to one based on inductive observations. Observations which, inside the earthbound confines of Midgard, were first undertaken and refined into a series of hypothesizes by the ancient Norse philosophers who crafted the original version of The Poetic Edda.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it is The Ancient Trinity&amp;rsquo;s Epilogue which is of interest to the aspirant, the first three volumes serving as a form of introductory reference manual; one which places the aspirant&amp;rsquo;s illusion of past cogitation into context, making it possible for it to commune with The Ancient One according to His Will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ancient Trinity was in no way penned by the stated editor. Rather, The Book was but heedlessly transcribed by the latter, following a series of gruesome nightmares; ones transferred to it by The Book&amp;rsquo;s Creator. S. P. Otte is unable to take credit for this Work: The Original Author far too powerful to be dismissed any longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empires come and go. The Ancient One is timeless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
