  <title>The Benevolent Universe - Dana Drake</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who we are and what we are to do on Earth is so important that the Universe has designed it so all pain is the same pain&amp;mdash;the denial of genius.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are hard-wired for genius. Genius is simply our purest, most genuine self, manifesting that which comes effortlessly to each of us. We arrived here with unique genius&amp;mdash;gifts for the future good and for the greater good&amp;mdash;to contribute abundantly to the Universe. All feelings of spiritual abundance and our ability to manifest physical abundance are linked with our unique genius as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the universal win-win. We are given the gifts only we can provide to the world, and it is all we will ever want to do. Our unique genius is the ultimate gift from the Universe. We are not designed to compete with our fellow man&amp;mdash;only to contribute Yet because our genius is unique, we will be required to do and say things &lt;em&gt;no one else ever has&amp;mdash;&lt;/em&gt;and this is often the reason we deny our genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Benevolent Universe, The Story of Your Unique Genius &lt;/em&gt;dispels the myth of genius being hard&amp;mdash;our genius is as effortless as our breath. Yet genius and contribution seem hard for many of us. The challenge of genius comes from its link to the manifestation of our unique purpose. For a moment, imagine you are your great-great-grandfather saying he is going to build a flying machine. What do you think your great-great-grandmother said to him? His kids? His neighbors? We often &lt;em&gt;choose&lt;/em&gt; self-denial and repress our purpose because we perceive we are going to hurt someone we love or be too different, placing our relationships&amp;mdash;or maybe our own physical safety&amp;mdash;in peril. For us to deny our purpose and suffer so others don&amp;rsquo;t is the most dangerous and persistent illusion of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Benevolent Universe, The Story of Your Unique Genius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is a romp through the design of the Universe&amp;mdash;the design a benevolence conspiracy of sorts to ensure we will contribute our own unique genius. It is a story of elegant, beautiful, empowering answers to our problems and how they are ultimately related to manifesting our unique genius.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Discover your own unique genius and how to have wonderful, empowering relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Learn why all suffering comes from repressing genius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Learn how your genius is related to your health, wealth, and feelings of self-worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;middot; Learn why genius has nothing to do with intellect or scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
