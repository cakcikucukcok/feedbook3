  <title>The Hand of God - Judy Keating, Mike Keating</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Hand of God&lt;/i&gt; is a non-fictional, compelling account of John Keatings survival and recovery after accidentally contacting 16,000-volt Swedish railroad power line.  It is an inspiring story of courage, determination, and the power of love.  The story traces his journey from the accident scene in the Swedish mountains, through his lengthy hospitalization and rehabilitation in Sweden, to the familys return to the United States.  The near-death experience affected many and the life saving amputations challenged their emotional resources.  The book includes many of the powerful letters he received.  These inspirational letters, which empowered John and his family, are as powerful today as they were when received.  The humor and the heartbreak, the joys and the disappointments, and the hopes and the frustrations are blended into an emotional and unforgettable story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
