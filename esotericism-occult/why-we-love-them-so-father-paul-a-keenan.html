  <title>Why We Love Them So - Father Paul A. Keenan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a beloved pet dies, the grief that often follows can be overwhelming. &lt;i&gt;Why We Love Them So: Surviving the Loss of an Animal Friend&lt;/i&gt; offers profound guidance on how to understand deep sorrow and eventually use its power to transform our lives.&lt;p&gt; 
Father Paul Keenan faced his own grief journey when Teddy, his twenty-five-year-old cat, passed away. Knowing the love he felt for Teddy was irreplaceable, Father Paul turned within and listened to his soul, sharing the valuable lessons he learned as a result. Along with providing a series of short reflections on various aspects of grieving, Father Paul moves those mourning the loss of an animal companion through the seven stages of grief that comprise such profound emotions as: 
Feeling alone after death 
Dealing with Why me? 
Learning to receive and offer compassion 
Realizing an overall purpose 
Sorting through past life experiences 
Returning to daily life 
Committing to a new level of aliveness and reality 
Father Pauls gentle advice and guidance will inspire, uplift, and connect readers with their capacity to live purposeful, meaningful lives after the loss of their much-adored animal companions.&lt;p&gt; 
All proceeds from this book go to The Perseus Foundation, a 501(c)(3) founded in 1999 which funds cancer research to benefit our canine and feline friends." />
