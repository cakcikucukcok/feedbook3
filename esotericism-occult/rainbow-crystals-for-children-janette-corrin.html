  <title>Rainbow Crystals for Children - Janette Corrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rainbow Crystals for Children&lt;/i&gt; is a book for young children of the 21st century with a message that crystals are not just pretty things to be chosen and then forgotten about. They are much more than this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is meant to be used by young children (sometimes assisted by an adult) from the time when they first display a reaction to or an interest in crystals to when they are older and can read and follow suggestions and activities for themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
There are brief explanations of how crystal energies and our own interact. Children are asked to look at why and how they decide a particular crystal is the one for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information and ideas offered are meant to lead the child to develop their inquiring and creative nature. Included are games to play to develop memory and perceptual skills. Short meditations are included to bring healing, develop visualization, and focus concentration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some brief explanations of how crystals began to form millions of years ago and the present day usage of quartz in modern technology make a link between the old and new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A crystal guide with pictures and information about thirty crystals is included. The crystals chosen are ones reasonably easy to find and suitable for children to work with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children will find that &lt;i&gt;Rainbow Crystals for Children&lt;/i&gt; will provide many hours of interest, learning, and fun. &lt;/p&gt;" />
