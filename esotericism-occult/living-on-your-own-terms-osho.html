      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Living on Your Own Terms: What Is Real Rebellion?&lt;/i&gt;, one of the twentieth century&#39;s greatest spiritual teachers reveals how you can resist the rules and regulations that oppose your values while retaining your own individuality.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;People can be happy only in one way, and that is if they are authentically themselves. Then the springs of happiness start flowing; they become more alive, they become a joy to see, a joy to be with; they are a song, they are a dance.&quot;--Osho&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Decades after the rebellions of the 1960s, new generations are again challenging and rebelling against outdated structures and values, focusing on political and economic systems and their failings. But this generation has the opportunity and responsibility to move the development of human freedom to the next level. Osho&#39;s philosophies will support these future generations in expanding their understanding of freedom and pushing toward new systems for humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
