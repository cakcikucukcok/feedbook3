  <title>Confessions of a Passionate Seeker - Dr. Pamela Gerali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After many years as a dedicated seeker, Dr. Pamela Gerali hit a wall. An energy-sapping virus forced her to examine her priorities and refocus on the Blueprint for the Human Spirit, her holistic model for conscious, compassionate living. She was guided to meditate and journal confessions for forty days. Baffled by the directive from her inner guru, she explored the significance of the number forty and discovered it represents rebirth. Three days later, Pamela arose early, went to her sacred space, lit a candle, and paused in the silence. A word sprang into her awareness: discipline! She picked up her pen and wrote a confession about her negative reaction to the topic. Memories flowed onto the pagepainful experiences, humorous recollections and powerful lessons. Finally, a positive affirmation that encapsulated her journey concluded the journal entry. &lt;br /&gt;
As Pamelas experiment in radical honesty continued, a new word emerged each day. At the end of the exercise, Pamela realized she had experienced a huge shift in awareness and made the leap of faith across the chasm from ego to essence. &lt;br /&gt;
In Confessions of a Passionate Seeker, Pamelas personal stories and revelations bring to life the Blueprint with all of its spiritual wisdom and practical guidance. By sharing her journal, she hopes to encourage seekers to experience their own deep soul cleanse and embrace their wholeness and oneness. &lt;br /&gt;
Pamela Geralis confessions made me want to honestly look at my life and its challenging times. If the book affects everyone this way, it will be a bestseller.&lt;br /&gt;
