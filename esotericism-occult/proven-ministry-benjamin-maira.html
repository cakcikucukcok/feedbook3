  <title>Proven Ministry - Benjamin Maira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God Gives the Best Thing in Life
In reading my book, Proven Ministry, not only you will know Jesus Christ and divine intimacy, but also other key topics. You will know topics like new level, Holy Spirit fresh touch, dynamic ministry, gospel impact, Christian living and 21st Century move. You will realize that the Lord Jesus Christ wants you also to be the best person and do the best in your profession. He wants you to have intimacy with him and do world service. You will discover three places that God took Paul the great apostle, to become a witness of Jesus Christ and minister of the gospel. What are these three places of great interest? Good question! Relax and receive the answer. The three places with God are Arabia, Antioch and Athens. Now each place has a significance. Firstly, Arabia is a place of devotion with Jesus Christ. Secondly, Antioch is a place of local church, where you receive pastoral ministry. Thirdly, Then comes the top place of all, which is Athens. It was at Athens that the apostle Paul did his world service away than church service at Antioch. God wants you to experience devotion with the Lord Jesus Christ, be part of a local church and have a pastor (sound minister), and finally do world service in your lifetime. You will also know two places of giving, known as Macedonia and Achaia. These two places of gold and silver supported financially the gospel ministry and apostleship of Paul. And finally you will know the godly couple of Aquila and Priscilla, who are living testimony to us all. That as a Christian couple, you too can worship and serve God together. 
My aim to write this book: Proven Ministry is so that the Holy Spirit may teach you, impart and make a testimony in your life. Seek the Lord Jesus Christ, be the best person and do the best in your profession ministry. Find divine intimacy with Jesus Christ and do world service to the people near you and far, both local and global. This is the best time (21st Century) to impact the world by the gospel of God." />
