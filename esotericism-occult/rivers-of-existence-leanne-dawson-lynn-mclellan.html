  <title>Rivers of Existence - Leanne Dawson, Lynn McLellan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My journey took me to England, USA, and Europe, through the guidance of Archangel Michael, activating Earth Acupuncture healing on major ley lines and power sites. The trip was life-changing, in that it provided me with answers to lifes mysteries which I had been searching for and unknowingly found the love of a partner. This book delves into the following topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The heart healing aspect of the modality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Includes the Earth Acupuncture process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; How to find and what to look for in a black stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; How to work with angelic beings and elementals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Examples of the space-clearing process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The dowsing response and how to work with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earth Acupuncture is a technique that sends healing to an area of environmental distress, restoring balance to the land and provides emotional and spiritual relief to the people who inhabit the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of Earth Acupuncture is built on the concept that there are many energy lines that crisscross the planet. These lines or grids have been mapped out and named by many dowsers who have journeyed across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the sacred sites across the world such as Chartres in France and Stonehenge in England reside over these energy grids. However, these energy grids can get out of balance when affected by catastrophic events such a war, famine, and human atrocities. When these events happen, the energy that was once sacred, clear, and flowing energetically can turn into a black stream, absorbing and carrying with it energy that can have a detrimental effect on the mental, emotional, and physical health of all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
