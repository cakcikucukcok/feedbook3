  <title>The wonders of the human body - George W. Carey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The churches and the laboratories have sought mammon. They tried to make themselves believe that they were searching for God, and sometimes they succeeded in making others believe it, also. If they had truly and humbly sought, they would have found that which they sought. Does the Almighty make a promise and not keep it? The Bible, the Kaballah, the Vedas, and ancient cuneiform tablets, torn from their hiding places in the heart of Mother Nature, all hold the key to the wisdom of the ages; and some there are who have turned the key and the door to understanding has opened. The author of this work has found the key and he has turned it. Erect and unafraid for he has nothing to lose or gain he reverently offers you that which you are seeking. He does not claim to be the only one who has discovered the key, but, working along the lines hinted at by some modern and many ancient seekers, he hereby presents the results of his many years of scientific research.&quot;
