  <title>The Power of Awareness - Neville Goddard, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Power of Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;allows those who rebelled against a rigid religious upbringing to renew some of the images etched in their consciousness, only in a more loving, positive and universal way. Neville shows how change of consciousness is the critical factor in life, for consciousness is the only reality, the first and only cause-substance of the phenomena of life.&lt;br /&gt;
Take an internal journey that will transform your daily life! In this, his most important work, he focuses on:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &amp;nbsp;Consciousness&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &amp;nbsp;The truth that sets you free&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &amp;nbsp;Attitude&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &amp;nbsp;Subjective control&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &amp;nbsp;Free will&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &amp;nbsp;Faith&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &amp;nbsp;Destiny&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
