  <title>You Are Not Broken - Rhonda Harris-Choudhry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you been trying to change your life for the better but can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get the results you crave?&lt;br /&gt;
Have you tried multiple law of attraction techniques but things don&amp;rsquo;t get better or just get worse?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you keep repeating the same patterns over and over again no matter how much you try to change?&lt;br /&gt;
Are you an empath or highly sensitive person who just can&amp;rsquo;t get on your own priority list?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Are you tired of struggling for financial abundance?&lt;br /&gt;
Are you tired of unsatisfactory relationships and can&amp;rsquo;t figure out why you keep ending up in them?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you truly desire change and just don&amp;rsquo;t know where to begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book was written to help you manifest the life you desire by first recognizing that you are not the broken one but your intention manifestation and/or law of attraction system is. The system you are using may be generalized and doesn&amp;rsquo;t take into consideration the special needs of empaths and highly sensitive people nor teach you how to first remove the toxic energy debris from your system that may be anchoring you so that you can&amp;rsquo;t move forward or how to change your subconscious behaviorism to create real change.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book will teach you how to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Remove the toxic energy debris caused by past and present traumas&lt;br /&gt;
Remove the energy cords attaching you to negative people and circumstances&lt;br /&gt;
Understand the lessons your trials have brought you to help you move past them and on with your life&lt;br /&gt;
Identify your custom psychic gifts to utilize them to help you manifest your desires&lt;br /&gt;
To retrain your subconscious so that it works for you and not against you&lt;br /&gt;
Use emotional shapeshifting to raise your vibration and attract what you want&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
And teach you how to customize the law of attraction so that it works specifically for you and your specific needs. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is especially helpful for spiritual workers and healers who provide so much service to the world but find their own lives in chaos or just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get for themselves what they so generously provide for others. You are not broken so let&amp;rsquo;s get started bringing positive change into your life. Namaste and Blessed Be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
