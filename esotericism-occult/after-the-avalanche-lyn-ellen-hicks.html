  <title>After the Avalanche - Lyn Ellen Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On February 11, 1992, my husband and our friend drove up to a local Southern California resort for a short day of skiing  and never returned.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began to experience an unfamiliar gamut of terrifying, confusing, and gripping emotions.  In the following 82 days of searching for them, I kept a journal of my thoughts, prayers and feelings,  also thinking what a wonderful story it would make when they survived and miraculously emerged from the devastating snowstorm and heavily avalanched mountainproving the power of prayer and the unlimited ability of God!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He didnt answer our prayers as we hoped; when my husbands lifeless body was recovered, the miracle story slipped away. I read everything I could find on grieving and became so frustrated that I could find so few of the kind of books I ached to read.  I wanted to share others journeys  to know their intimate thoughts and their struggles and their triumphs.  I felt the Spirit prompting to write my own bookthat there were others like me who would be edified by reading my story.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter when or how you have suffered loss, you will recognize, relate, and be encouraged as you travel Ellen&#39;s journeyplunging into the depths of the valley of death, digging through the mountain of debris, and emerging to find hope, healing and new life &lt;i&gt;After the Avalanche&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;" />
