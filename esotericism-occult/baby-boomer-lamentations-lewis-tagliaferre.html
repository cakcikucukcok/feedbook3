  <title>Baby Boomer Lamentations - Lewis Tagliaferre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today there are approximately seventy-six million Americans who were born in the years from 1946 to 1965the baby boomers. In their youth they thrived, voting for a number of entitlements based on  assumptions of economic growth that no longer applies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as baby boomers continue aging, they must face a number of potentially disheartening realities. From caring for ailing parents to funding their  retirement to facing death, many issues weigh too heavily upon the minds of the baby boomer generation to allow for a peaceful, productive second half of life. Whats more, many of the spiritual belief systems passed down for so many generations no longer provide the comfort or support people need in order to face the challenges of the later half of life. The people need something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this second edition of &lt;b&gt;Baby Boomer Lamentations&lt;/b&gt;, author and self-proclaimed religious philosopher Lewis Tagliaferre explores the concept of Theofatalism and addresses the rising spiritual concerns of the baby boomers, offering a new outlook to help readers make the inevitable transitions through the later years of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
