  <title>I Lost Two Boobs and Gained Two Balls - Gail Rognan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a healthy fifty-eight-year-old woman, a cancer diagnosis rocked author Gail Rognans world. In I Lost Two Boobs and Gained Two Balls, Rognan shares how she moved from fear and doubt to strength and serenity. She offers a raw, candid account of how she grew a pair and found her voice, realizing that in order to live she had to speak up and risk being judged and criticized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her unconventional path to healing is both a memoir and a practical, supportive resource for anyone whose life has been touched by cancer. Each chapter offers tips and resources for current cancer patients and chronicles the steps Rognan took in her own journey. By facing her illness and possible death head-on, she is offering knowledge that may make it easier for those who also have a difficult path to travel. By sharing her story, she sheds light on the darkness and guides you each step of the journey. Her story shares how you can learn how:&lt;/p&gt;
 our mind, body, and spirit intersect to help us heal ourselves;&lt;/br&gt;
 alternative health treatments can be combined with traditional health treatments;&lt;/br&gt;
 to listen to ourselves so we can avoid illness; and&lt;/br&gt;
 our illness can teach us about who we really are.&lt;/p&gt;
Realistic and inspiring, I Lost Two Boobs and Gained Two Balls offers a poignant story for those touched by cancer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
