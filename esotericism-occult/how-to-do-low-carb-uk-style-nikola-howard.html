I&amp;#39;m Nikola Howard, Mindset Maven. A polymath that has the superpower of &amp;ldquo;connecting the dots&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m an author, coach, success&amp;nbsp;&amp;amp; human physiology mentor and creative&amp;nbsp;entrepreneur, and I firmly believe that to be a fully realised and peaceful human, one needs to take care of both body and mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been eating low carb since 1999, am&amp;nbsp;deeply into the science of how the human body works&amp;nbsp;and my research has convinced me that&amp;nbsp;the advice given about a &amp;quot;healthy balanced diet&amp;quot; is anything but!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m on a mission to remove the linguistically horrific words &amp;ldquo;weight loss&amp;rdquo; from common usage and my crazy idea is to improve the world by helping others free their minds from self-hate and their bodies from slavery to carbohydrate addiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
