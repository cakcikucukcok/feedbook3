Deeply skeptical, she denied her talent for years. But as she gradually reconciled her ability with her religious beliefs, Kim embraced who she is&amp;#8212;and ultimately accepted her soul&amp;#8217;s mission as a voice for the spirit world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known as the &amp;#8220;Happy Medium&amp;#8221; for her authenticity, warmth, and her honest, positive readings, Kim has helped people from all walks of life to connect with those who have passed on. Now, this world-renowned medium demystifies the world of the dead for everyone. The key to understanding, she contends, is energy, which cannot be destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happy Medium&lt;/em&gt; interweaves experiences from Kim&amp;#39;s life with some of the best, most astounding behind-the-scenes stories of her celebrity readings from episodes of her Lifetime show, &lt;em&gt;The Haunting Of . . .&lt;/em&gt; . In addition, she gives you the tools to access the energy that is all around us, including the experiments and lessons she uses in many of her sold-out appearances and courses around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following her mantra, &amp;#8220;Let them lead you,&amp;#8221; Kim shows you how to let the world of the dead guide you to greater understanding of life&amp;#8217;s biggest questions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
