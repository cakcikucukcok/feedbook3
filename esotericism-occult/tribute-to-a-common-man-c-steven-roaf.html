  <title>Tribute to a Common Man - C. Steven Roaf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it truly possible for a man to live an entire life and then leave this earthly existence with no mark? The story of the purposeful life of a common man begins with an unwed mother in Victorian-era New England and her illegitimate son. This boy of humble beginnings eventually grew to be a manneither famous nor wealthybut one who left a lasting legacy that still inspires others today, even some twenty-five years after his death.&lt;p&gt;
C. Steven Roaf s grandfather could be gruff or comicaloccasionally possessing the anger of a raging bull and often relying on an impish smile to reveal his mischievous intentions. Like many others who have lived unnoticed by much of the world, Chester Warren Roaf unknowingly influenced his grandson as a second father, companion, and hero. Beginning with his genealogy and continuing with anecdotes, Roaf offers a glimpse into the valuable life lessons that still ring true while exploring traditional values seemingly rare in todays society.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Tribute to a Common Man&lt;/i&gt; not only shares the inspiration behind a touching bond between a grandfather and grandson, but also serves as a memorial to a life more full of love than fame." />
