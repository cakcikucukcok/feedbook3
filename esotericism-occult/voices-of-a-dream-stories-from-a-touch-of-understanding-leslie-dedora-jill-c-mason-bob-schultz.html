  <title>Voices of a Dream: Stories from A Touch of Understanding - Leslie Dedora, Jill C. Mason, Bob Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you remember when you were a child in school? Can you picture that one student who was always teased or bullied because he or she seemed &amp;ldquo;different?&amp;rdquo; It may have been the way she walked, or the way he struggled to read. He may have had emotional outbursts. She may have used a wheelchair. There was at least one student who was teased or bullied for being different. You may have seen it happen. You may have been the one teased or bullied. Or, you may have been the bully. Everyone has been touched by this destructive cycle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;A Touch of Understanding (ATOU) works every day to help children who are the victims of teasing and bullying, along with those who witness the incidents and the children who do the teasing and bullying. &lt;em&gt;Voices of a Dream&lt;/em&gt; introduces the ATOU Team members who helped one woman turn her dream into a movement to promote genuine inclusion of all children in school and community settings&amp;mdash;a movement touching thousands of lives each year, breaking down the walls of misunderstanding and abuse, and building bridges of friendship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Read about an aerobatic pilot who uses two myoelectric hands, a young woman with autism who stretched beyond her comfort zone and is now in film school, and a survivor of a tragic drunk driving accident who was the impetus for this book. Learn about the many people who come together to share their stories to educate and inspire a new generation to welcome those who seem &amp;ldquo;different&amp;rdquo; for any reason.&lt;/p&gt;" />
