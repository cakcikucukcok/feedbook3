  <title>Healing the Wound from My Daughter’S Suicide - Lois Severson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With thousands of known suicides taking place in the United States each year, it is very possible you have already been touched. In Healing the Wound from My Daughters Suicide, author Lois Severson shares the true story of how her family was deeply affected by the tragedy of suicide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She narrates the story of the suicide of her twenty-six-year-old daughter Patty in June of 2005. Severson recalls a personal journey through the grief process from the perspective of the mother, father, and sister of the victim. She also includes Pattys suicide letter and selected diary entries and addresses the subject of mental illness and its role in suicides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raw and emotional, Healing the Wound from My Daughters Suicide provides keen insight into family dynamics following the suicide of a loved one. It shows how one family navigated the grief and healing process and found comfort through help from their community, from within the family, and through their faith in God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
