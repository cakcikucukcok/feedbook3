  <title>Fair to Fabulous in Fifteen Minutes - Wayne L. Rickman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Using the baseball analogy that is the woven throughout the book, Wayne Rickman in &lt;i&gt;Fair-to-Fabulous in Fifteen Minutes&lt;/i&gt; has hit a homerun! Drawing upon his extensive experience in marketing, sales, coaching, parenting, and life, Mr. Rickman has succeeded where many of his predecessors have not. &lt;i&gt;Fair-to-Fabulous&lt;/i&gt; is not only entertaining and inspirational, but it is also educational and useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than simply relying upon feel good stories or five rules for a lifetime of bliss, the book employs the use of questions rather than pat answers. By posing carefully crafted sets of basic questions and open lists for the reader to consider and then answer in each chapter, by the end the reader has not only been on an illuminating journey of self-discovery, but even more importantly a clearer path forward towards a more rich and rewarding personal and professional life. It truly does take you around the proverbial bases and by the time you reach home plate, you really do feel fabulous about your ability to shape and respond to what the future has in store. Love &lt;i&gt;Fair to Fabulous&lt;/i&gt;, this is a winner Wayne. Andy Abrams, President and Dean Charleston School of Law&lt;/p&gt;" />
