  <title>Loitering at the Gate to Eternity - Louisa Oakley Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Louisa Oakley Green didnt believe in psychic phenomena when she met her husband Stephen. Now, twenty years later, this self-described psychic bystander from New Jersey shares haunting tales from family, friends, and strangers who see life through the veil of clairvoyance and mediumship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Loitering at the Gate to Eternity, Green chronicles the psychic tales of everyday people, from school teachers and business professionals to blue collar workers, from children to senior citizens, as well as four gifted psychic professionals. Some have had only one psychic experience in their lives while others are guided by them daily. Green offers engrossing insights into the world of clairvoyance, out-of-body experiences, and the peculiar penchant deceased relatives and friends have for sharing burdens and celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Providing credence to the belief that everyone possesses psychic ability, though some seem to have a more natural affinity than others, Loitering at the Gate to Eternity chronicles Greens journey from skeptic to believer through more than one hundred paranormal stories involving her husband, his family, and friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
