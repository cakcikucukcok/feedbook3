  <title>Sacred Light - Myndee Joan Garrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended to be a source of Light for those who are questioning their faith. It is simply a tool to help you find your sacred spiritual path in Life. What do you believe to be true that is untouchable, beyond doubt? Investigating your own treasured truths is an excellent place to begin your journey of illumination. What I know for sure is that a crisis can be the greatest gift. It is during our darkest moments that we can become extremely conscious of the precious Light within us. Let your wounds from Life reveal your authentic self by being a place for your Sacred Light to shine through. Losing my religion and discovering a profound faith in myself as a mystical being has convinced me that the greatest Love, purest Peace, and holiest Light must come from within. Love, Peace, and Light must be known in the very being of your Soul as the truth, and essence, of who you are in order to bestow genuine Love, Peace, and Light to others. Be the Light you want to see shining in this world so it can be reflected in every Soul you encounter. Breaking away from the Mormon Church created within me a profound yearning to speak my truth boldly, to live my Life unapologetically and authentically, to follow my heart unashamedly, and to contribute to the healing, and the encouragement, of others who are also finding their own way through this miraculous, mystical mystery called Life." />
