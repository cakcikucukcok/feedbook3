  <title>Between You, God, and Me - Eve L. Princler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your identity can be summed up in the management of three critical relationships: your relationship with God, your relationship with you, and your relationship with others.  Through these relationships we learn, develop, and cement our habits and personalities.  Between You, God, and Me explores each of these relationships from a spiritual perspective, using practical knowledge to expose the traps often used to destroy unity of mind, body, and spirit. Each lesson will take you on a journey in discovering the depth and beauty of Gods love, the necessity of self-love, and your role in expressing Gods love toward your family, friends, and colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not your typical devotional!  Each lesson will arouse your emotions, challenge your beliefs, and force you to acknowledge thought patterns and behaviors that prevent you from living a life of purpose. Using biblical and scientific evidence, you will discover Gods plan and purpose for your life; recognize attitudes that prevent you from succeeding in your goals, and identify tools to help you create a joyful, stress-free, existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a few minutes each day, Eve will accompany you as you uncover Gods love while preparing you to live a life of liberty, harmony, and peace.  Between You, God, and Me is a powerful devotional tool intended to help you celebrate your intimate relationships and foster positive change within your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
