  <title>New Spiritual Answers to Lifeýs Big Questions - Marianne Figge Stein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you want meaningful, inspirational answers to important questions about God, the universe, and the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Are you an open-minded, spiritual seeker who is willing to look outside the boundaries of traditional religions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then you&#39;ll want to know about new spirituality. It&#39;s not a new religion or organization; it&#39;s a new worldview based on love, tolerance, compassion, and freedom. It&#39;s based on the writings of people such as Neale Donald Walsch, author of the &lt;I&gt;Conversations with God&lt;/I&gt; books, but it also draws on sources ranging from ancient mysticism to contemporary science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book serves as an introduction to new spirituality for people who are ready to embark on a spiritual journey. In a question-and-answer format, it discusses important issues in a clear, inspirational, and practical way that will help you cultivate inner peace and happier relationships in your daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ll find out what new spirituality has to say about topics such as love, karma, suffering, and the future of humanity. You&#39;ll also learn about reincarnation, co-creation, intuition, and healing. And above all, you&#39;ll acquire a compassionate and empowering basis for finding your own way to enlightenment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
