  <title>H&amp;H - Ricky S. Sanderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;According to a Single Parent Statistics study, who is the &quot;Average&quot; Single Parent? In fact, many Americans would be surprised to learn just how much they have in common with the average single parent. According to Custodial Mothers and Fathers and Their Child Support: 2007, released by the U.S. Census Bureau in November, 2009, there are approximately 13.7 million single parents in the United States today, and those parents are responsible for raising 21.8 million children (approximately 26% of children under 21 in the U.S. today).  There are ethnic differences in the prevalence of single-parent families. In 1999 the rate of single-parent families among Black families was 56 percent; among Hispanic families, 32 percent; and among White families, 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;      whether you are in a department store or in a crowded bar; Relationships usually began once eye contact has been made, and hearts starts to beat a little faster. In this book I have shown some real and very useful principles that can be found in the Bible. This is by no means a religious book; it just uses The Word to bring couples closer together. If you are in a relationship, if you are thinking about jumping into a relationship, if you have been in a relationship for some time this book can be a big help to you and your partner.  Thank you for the support. Enjoy: Thank you Holy Spirit for your inspiration. &lt;/p&gt;" />
