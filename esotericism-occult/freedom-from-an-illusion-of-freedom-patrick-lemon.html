  <title>Freedom from an Illusion of Freedom - Patrick Lemon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;First let me mention that the main characters in the book are the readers and the readers are the audience too. Find out how and what character describes you best throughout the novel. Fear is one of the main forces that create this illusion of freedom. &quot;Just because you are scared does not mean you are entitled to back down,&quot; (Lemon). Believing the belief that you are free is the very belief that creates this illusion. Then this belief traps you within an illusion of freedom and is the very belief that prevents you from realizing you are not free by any means of what you thought freedom was and what freedom really is. You believing that belief is what prevent you from discovering, seeing, understanding and experiencing what true freedom is and means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My book is a manuscript that offers the following: internal psychology, optimistic/positive psychology, reflective psychology, self-improvement psychology, self-knowledge psychology, therapy, spirituality, sociology, philosophy, workology, streetology, survivology (higher survival awareness /teens and adults), better relationship awareness (work, couples, or in general) and is a parental guide. This is not a conspiracy theory novel nor is it fiction. It is real events and real experiences anyone can experience. This book is a self-improvement; self-developmental novel that shows people how to find and bring out their deep rooted power, true freedom, and potential of which they never knew existed or never knew how to bring out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
