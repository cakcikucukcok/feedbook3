  <title>Undone: My Path Home - Rose Northfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world around me is dark and bitter. I know that my walk is not straight. My veins are sore and broken. My hands tremble, and my head is fogged with misery and death. Ive lost my hope, my faith, and my way. Ive been blinded by the darkness; I cant find the light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revelation of my iniquity causes tears to well up in my eyes, blurring my vision. But then, something starts to happen with the tears. They begin to purify my sight. I look up at the sky as the clouds start to dissipate, and the sun peaks through with its long warm rays, touching my inner core, building within it the strength of true existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My veins begin to heal and strengthen; the blood once again flowing through them with courageous life. As I wake up, I am able to see the world around me, the life and the death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The death is like a lethal smog existing within our atmosphere  patiently awaiting its next victim. Whereas, there is a fresh clear rushing waterfall that brings life to all who choose to dwell along it. That is where I found my home, and I will not turn away from it again. I cried out, I am slipping! but your unfailing love,  O Lord, supported me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Psalm 94:18, NLT&lt;/p&gt;" />
