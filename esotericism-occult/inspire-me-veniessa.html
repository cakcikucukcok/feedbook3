  <title>Inspire Me - Veniessa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a person in this era, a complicated world full of emotion that is more acceptable to bring forth in all situations, it can be difficult to find not your voice but your soul. Most of us today have been taught by our parents, peers, or perhaps sometimes even a stranger how to use our voice, how to stand up for ourselves, how to judge, distrust, and have an opinion. However, in a world so smart and accepting of emotion, we have forgotten or dont know at all to honor our soul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such an important part of who we are as people, and for many of us, we dont take the time to nurture it at all. I dont believe a soul needs monetary things; it doesnt feel hate, anger, jealousy, distrust, or judgment. It is the truest form of our being and is exempt of such loud negativity that we label emotion. We claim its now acceptable as it somehow makes us an individual, therefore, something to take pride inshame on us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What would it be like without these emotions? Personally, its a secret dream of mine. In my strangest state, I often wonder, if we were to be able to leave conjured emotion alone and only feed or honor the soul, could we then be on a higher plane? A different space, if you will, away from reality. Among the rest of the living things that are without ego-driven state but only the purest of motivation to feed what lays within.&lt;/p&gt;" />
