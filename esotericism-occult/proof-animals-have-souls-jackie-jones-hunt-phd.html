  <title>Proof Animals Have Souls - Jackie Jones-Hunt PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This bestselling Animal Souls serialized research of generously sized instalments is a gripping &quot;must read&quot; for all those who consider themselves religiously or spiritually inclined as these books stimulate readers to reflect on our true relationship to the rest of sentient creation and convincingly reveal our shared continued survival beyond physical death.         This life-changing and thought provoking research not only provides thoroughly convincing evidence that all animals, human and non-human, survive physical death but progressively provides the authentic, original, undistorted teachings of the founders of world religions which taught us all-embracing and all-inclusive compassion for all animals.          The founders of world religions originally taught us never to harm animals, instead to eat the non-violent vegetarian diet, with healthier, peaceful repercussions for the human animal. Proof Animals Have Souls is the first in this engrossing serialization. The thought-provoking research to be read in the Animal Souls Serialization is indeed life-changing. It is incredible to read such words of love and wisdom that have so much in common, each prophetic founder of world religions is so obviously drawing from that divine spiritual font of all-inclusive love and wisdom.          These spiritually elevated prophets, each remind us, that despite the differing intelligence in each animal, from the 2-legged human animal to the 4 -legged non-human animal, feathered or tailed, what is important is that each and every animal feels pain, and all fear and feel abuse, suffering, cruelty and murder.  This holds true for the entire range of creatures on our planet including the smallest to the largest- embracing- lobsters, turkeys, chickens, cows, horses, dogs and cats - all fear and feel pain and murder!! What a fantastic serialization!" />
