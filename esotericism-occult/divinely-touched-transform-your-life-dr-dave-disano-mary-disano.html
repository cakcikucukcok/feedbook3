  <title>Divinely Touched: Transform Your Life - Dr. Dave DiSano, Mary DiSano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Divinely Touched&lt;/i&gt; is a story of personal transformation. It chronicles Marys spiritual awakening, how she was divinely saved, led, and transformed. From the depths of depression, from battles with physical ailments for which the medical profession had no explanations, from being led into worlds she never knew existed, she survived being taken to the underworld. She was guided and healed by light workers, shamans, and avatars from this world and the spirit dimension and led on a journey of personal, physical, mental, and spiritual healing. Marys experience, like that of a caterpillar when transformed into a beautiful butterfly, is one that will inspire, enlighten, and transform your life as well. Dr. Dave uses science, research, and knowledge of the ages to explain what Mary experienced and open worlds to the reader that they may never have imagined. &lt;i&gt;Divinely Touched: Transform Your Life&lt;/i&gt; can, in fact, do just that.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With painstaking detail, Mary describes her descent into darkness and her triumphant return. Like Margaret Starbird, in The Goddess in the Gospels, who also has a spiritual awakening that took her into the realms of psychosis, Mary describes a similar personal descent into darkness before bursting forth into spiritual awareness. Inside you will find a compelling story that may help you or someone you love.&lt;br&gt; 
Maureen St. Germain, author of Beyond the Flower of Life &amp; You Are the Genie in the Bottle&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The world is waiting for this powerful story of good vs. evil. Marys story is amazing, compelling, eye-opening, and courageous. Her faith has carried her through the darkness into the light. She is Gods instrument and truly a living expression of divine light flowing forth into the world. &lt;i&gt;Divinely Touched&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read, and you wont want to put it down. It will blow your mind!&lt;br&gt; 
Pat Hastings, Author of Simply a Woman of Faith: How to Live in Spiritual Power and Transform Your Life&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Marys amazing story will capture your interest and touch your heart. You will be inspired to move forward on your own journey of awakening.&lt;br&gt; 
Andrew Oser, author of How Alternation Can Change Your Life; Finding the Rhythms of Health and Happiness&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Divinely Touched is a wonderful book that documents an impassioned and heartfelt account of the pitfalls and triumphs of personal awakening.&lt;br&gt;
