  <title>Stress – The CommonSense Approach - Brenda O&#39;Hanlon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Most people feel that they suffer from stress at some time or another, whether in the home, the workplace, within the family or amongst colleagues or friends. It has almost become part of living in today’s fast-paced world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thoroughly researched and written in an accessible style, &lt;i&gt;Sleep &amp;mdash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt; looks at stress in all its forms. The author Brenda O’Hanlon believes that it is not so much a question of how to rid our lives of stress, but how to harness it, exploit it and control it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;She recognises that more often than not, stress can be managed by the individual. She provides a useful checklist to assess your level of stress and goes on to discuss stress management, relaxation techniques, nutrition and diet, medication and other remedies. Lists of useful addresses and further reading are also included. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The &lt;i&gt;CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt; series is a series of self-help guides that provide practical and sound ways to deal with many of life’s common complaints. Each book in the series is written for the layperson, and adopts a commonsense approach to the many questions surrounding a particular topic. It explains what the complaint is, how and why it occurs, and what can be done about it. It includes advice on helping ourselves, and information on where to go for further help. It encourages us to take responsibility for our own health, to be sensible and not always to rely on medical intervention for every ill. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Other titles in the series include &lt;i&gt;Depression &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Menopause &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sleep &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stress &amp;ndash; The CommonSense Approach&lt;/i&gt;: Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;Foreword by Professor Anthony Clare&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Did You Know That … ?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;All About Stress&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Life Even Crises &amp;mdash; the Pecking Order&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Behaviour/Personality Types and the Stress Equation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are You In Trouble? &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress Management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress Busters Round Up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time Management &amp;mdash; Practical Tips&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Exercise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Nutrition and Diet&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Medication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alternative Therapies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stress Management Techniques&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Centres of Expertise&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choosing A Therapist&lt;/li&gt;Useful Addresses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
