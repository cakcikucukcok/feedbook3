  <title>The Black Grimoire - Marlin Dujuan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Im so, so excited to be at the end of The Black Grimoire. It was extreme work to gather all the material and use it the right way for you to gain an understanding of it. This book is a magical text full of secrets being revealed. Wisdom and clarity and joy are the feelings you get when you open up The Black Grimoire. Before you open it up, make sure you are on a light, way fast, and extreme meditation. This book/grimoire is not the book you will find on a regular basis. It holds the key to the meaning of deeper knowledge of Lucifer as well as black. The Black Grimoire contains poetry, more research on melanin, Bible scriptures that you dont see like this, the mark of Cain, and the meaning of the soul power, amino acids, and the human body. There is also more on the house of the Lord as the temple is my Lord, encounters of the deceased, opening of gateways and portals, definitions from the black law dictionary, and more definitions pertaining to the etymology of words. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I enjoyed writing it. 
The Black Grimoire was inspired by the Am that resides in me. The love that I have for my people has increased since the writings. And the love of writings increased. I love people who love me. Marlin Dujuan, how can I hate the man who will show me love and respect? Marlin, that will be a form of ignorance and stupidity. Wisdom just inspired me to love self and respect self (self-love). Self-love is not just loving your own culture, but its to love oneself as you. A person will not love his brother if he cant love his self, and if you disagree with this, where are you living at? What world are you existing in, my brother? Were not here to judge at all, only to love and to reveal. 
Love and peace to the gods!" />
