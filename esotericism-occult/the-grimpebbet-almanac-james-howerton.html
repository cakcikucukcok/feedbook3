  <title>The Grimpebbet Almanac - James Howerton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dear Reader: This book will change your life when you read it, and might even induce you to send money to its creator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&#39;ve already picked up this book, and if you&#39;re reading the back cover, you must know that you are in the Celebrated Few who can spot great literature at a glance. Read this book, learn about everything mystical, magical and rewarding there possibly is. There are many dumb asses walking the earth, you know this. The Grimpebbet Almanac isn&#39;t for them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But you know. And so do we. Folks who read books are smarter than folks who don&#39;t, that&#39;s a mathematical certainty. Read this book and find out secrets that will change your life. There&#39;s no reason to let the dumb asses in on it--not just yet. They don&#39;t, after all, have much money. And the great wisdom in this book would be lost on them. The mere fact that you picked a book off a shelf indicates that you are far and above the...unfortunates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy this book and read it, or something very disturbing and wrong must be going on in your life. You pay money for dog food; you must pay money for a book this epic and life-changing. You&#39;re smart enough to buy and read the Grimpebbet Almanac. It is a beacon of light in a sea of dumb asses. &lt;/p&gt;
