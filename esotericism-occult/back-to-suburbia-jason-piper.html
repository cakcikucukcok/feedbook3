  <title>Back to Suburbia - Jason Piper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever visited somewhere for the first time, yet had the strange feeling youd been there before? Perhaps you have always had an interest in a particular era or location for no obvious reason. Or maybe you have had recurring dreams of yourself in a distant time or faraway place. It could just be a coincidenceor something much, much more.&lt;p&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;Back to Suburbia: Reincarnated in Suburban Chicago&lt;/i&gt;, Jason Piper offers a
glimpse into his life and many of the extraordinary paranormal events that he has experienced. He was born with the consciousness of an adult, including memories of previous lifetimes. Here, he presents his own true history, along with some of his near death experiences, and what he
brought back from beyond.&lt;p&gt;
Its a very long journey packed into a relatively short book, presented in this way specifically to encourage readers young and old to experience this journey in a short period of time. Unlock old memories, bask in the glow of consciousness, and discover your true self and souls purpose; make the most of this lifetime and every lifetime to come." />
