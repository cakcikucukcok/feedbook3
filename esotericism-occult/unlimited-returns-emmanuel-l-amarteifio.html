  <title>Unlimited Returns - Emmanuel L. Amarteifio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Success in life is what this book promises without fail. Make a list of all the things you really desire to be or have as your possessions here on earth, then read this book as many times as possible until you understand and can apply all the principles therein. This book will hook you up with the owner of all the things you have listed in a harmonious way. If you will, then keep your mind stayed on Him from today for the rest of your life. I can assure you that you will die a fulfilled and a very happy person. Success in life is your destiny, resolve to achieve it, and this book will show you the way.
This book is a testament to the work of Bishop Dr. Susuana Amarteifio in the life of the author, Rev. Emmanuel L. Amarteifio, one of many leaders Bishop Susuana has raised in a lifetime of work in the kingdom of God. Bishop Dr. Susuana Amarteifio has dedicated her whole life to God, making a difference in the lives of many and raising leaders for the work of the ministry wherever she goes. 
She has travelled around the world and strongly believes that true leaders in ministry do not delight in maintaining followers but raising leaders who will do greater works than they have done, and the best way to do that is by giving everybody a chance, to bring out the leader in them. This book is a testament to that philosophy. She is also the founder and leader of Jesus Christ of Nazareth International Church, with branches in Ghana, United Kingdom, Holland, and Germany, and the author of Destined for Excellence." />
