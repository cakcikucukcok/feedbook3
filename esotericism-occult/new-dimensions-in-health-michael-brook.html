  <title>New Dimensions in Health - Michael Brook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The problems that exist in the world cannot be solved by the same kind of thinking that created them. Albert Einstein&lt;br /&gt;
New Dimensions in Health explores the emerging new paradigm in creating optimal health and healing on all levels: physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, social, economic and environmental. On an individual level there is a growing understanding that all of these different arenas of life are interrelated, each one affecting the others. On a societal and planetary level it is clear that the problems of health care, economics, energy, food production, international conflict and environmental concerns are all interrelated and cannot be solved without understanding how each effect the others. There are solutions to these problems; however, they wont be found in the current cultural paradigms. Whether you are struggling with a serious health challenge, or are an elite athlete, or are aspiring to heal yourself or the planet, youll find insights and resources that will help you move to the next level. Its time to shift to a higher level of consciousness. Its time to step into a New Dimension.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the individual to the organization, from the cell to the society, from the person to the planet there are laws and principles that govern the processes of health within each entity. New Dimensions in Health will teach you these principles and inspire you to implement them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
New Dimensions in Health provides the reader with practical and effective tools for transcending their own boundaries in every realm of life. The book is both informative and empowering for anyone committed to optimal self-care, providing a detailed road map for raising consciousness and becoming fully alive.&lt;br /&gt;
