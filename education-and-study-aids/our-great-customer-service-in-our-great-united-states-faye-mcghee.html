  <title>Our Great Customer Service in Our Great United States - Faye Mcghee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As I have said so many times in my life Knowledge is power and when you
know what is going to happen and you come to expect it you can deal with
it a lot better. We cannot let the terrible customer service we get defi ne us
though. I have found that when customers are rude, mean or demanding
it is because they have allowed the customer service representatives to
make them that way.
Control your own life and do not allow the customer service representative
to do it for you. I feel that if I have a lot of stress in my life and I can deal
with the craziness of our terrible customer service representatives without
going postal so can everyone else.
As I said before control your own life. When the guy at the cash register
stares blankly at you and ask you for your discount card and you just
handed it to him just smile and point to it. You are on your way home at
this point anyway." />
