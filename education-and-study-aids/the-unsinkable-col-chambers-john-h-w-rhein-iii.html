He makes me smileS.R. Art Collector
The Col. is a colorful character who will have you scratching your head and then saying Eureka! I get it ! S.D.Teachers aid
The Col. is a remarkable reflection of his creatorM.W. Registered Nurse Ret.
I can&#39;t decide which illustration I like best.Theyre all great.-E.A. Tax Consultant
I love the horses and hounds he surround himself with-J.K. Hydrogeologist Ret.
My life would be much duller without John&#39;s clever sense of humor.- R.S. Entrepreneur
There&#39;s only one other person who could have conceived Col. Chambers, and that is
P G. Wodehouse, and he would have assigned Jeeves and Bertie Wooster to join the hunt. What fun that would be!- D.F. TV-VP Ret.
John is witty, fun, and knowledgeable, and his creativity has resulted in unique new projects and ideas that benefit a wide circle of people.S. Z.
Author/Lecturer/Psychologist.
Verbally and pictorially humorous journeys with a Victorian gentleman many people can identify with. All a joy to digest.-J.R.
Artist/Sculptor/Decorator
The fun is in your fingers. Its the lines that do it; the gags are the excuse. You leave the comic energy right on the page, capturing the Colonels absurd self assurance in the rakish angle of the single unit of head and hat, at large in his own imagined world, fragile and indestructible all at once.  Its a fun thing, John, and you deserve all the credit for concocting it. D.F Philosopher" />
