      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;This is the autobiography of a
little boy of mixed racial background. He was born in 1938, in rural &lt;span
class=GramE&gt;Georgia,&lt;/span&gt; the child of sharecroppers in abject poverty .The
story takes the reader inside the thoughts of this boy and allows them to view
his feelings and actions as he becomes a man. The little boy experiences the
American process of character genocide as practiced by benevolent adults. He
refuses to accept the boundaries, the subhuman treatment and his stated inferiority
in a racist society .His inner strength and genetics enable him to obtain many
of his set goals. The boy finds that all things come at a price and he comes to
a conclusion. Although he is; he views himself not as a Caucasian, not as a
Native American or an African American but as a fortunate and gifted human
being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;He breaks 15,000 years of Native
American tradition and shares his experiences with the reader. &lt;span
class=GramE&gt;&quot;Just because the white man says it.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=GramE&gt;That
don&#39;t&lt;/span&gt; make it so. Don&#39;t explain yourself to the whites because they will
never understand you anyway.&quot; Y &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;ou&lt;/span&gt; come to feel
and understand the little boy&#39;s curiosity about adult behavior and his
determination to persevere and survive at a high personal cost as the rite of
passage takes him through his childhood. He learns the lessons of life that
good as well as bad people come in all colors. All people must be judged as
individuals and on personal merit. The reader becomes aware of the acuteness &lt;span
class=SpellE&gt;ofhis&lt;/span&gt; pain and the unfairness of life as the boy reaches for
the American dream. &lt;/p&gt;
