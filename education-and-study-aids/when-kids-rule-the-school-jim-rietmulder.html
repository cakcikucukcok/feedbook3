  <title>When Kids Rule the School - Jim Rietmulder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Kids Rule the School &lt;/em&gt;lays out the theory and practice of self-directed democratic schooling &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Written by the co-founder of The Circle School, open since 1984. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This book is the first comprehensive guide to the theory and practice. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In self-directed democratic schools, kids practice life in a microcosm of society, empowered as voters, bound by laws, challenged by choice, supported by community, and driven by nature. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;When Kids Rule the School &lt;/em&gt;shows you how it works, in concept and in practice, focusing on one of the oldest such schools in North America. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Covers how the school is governed by students and staff together and offers a look at day-to-day life in a democratic school &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-directed schools have been around for 50 years, with dozens in North America and many more worldwide.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Includes dozens of personal stories. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Self-directed democratic schooling results in higher rates of college attendance, more undergraduate and graduate degrees, healthy relationships with authority, and unflinching self responsibility. &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identifies 14 new learning-teaching methods and modes, previously unavailable in schools &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intended audience &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Parents, especially homeschoolers and unschoolers, teachers, and scholars of education who are looking for alternatives to the mainstream education system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;International: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;Democratic schools exist worldwide. Summerhill School, the world&#39;s first democratic school, is located in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;" />
