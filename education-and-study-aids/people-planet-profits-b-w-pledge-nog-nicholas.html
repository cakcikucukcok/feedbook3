      <meta name="description" content="The elephant has arrived, and he has commenced his rampage of chaos and destruction.
Where is the elephant? 
Dont you see him? He is everywhere!
With the elephant arriving and making himself at home, the world has entered a new state of flux. With his arrival, he has also brought to light many other seemingly irresolvable dilemmas for us to contemplate and struggle with, and he is using these to distract us from what is most importanthis stay with us.
At present, the elephant is still small, but given time, as he becomes fully grown, he will really be a force to contend with. 
The elephant represents something we all must sooner than later acknowledge. He may be presently invisible to most of us, but he does want us to see him, acknowledge him, and heed his message. He is here to warn us of an ever-increasing problem that is about to impact us all." />
