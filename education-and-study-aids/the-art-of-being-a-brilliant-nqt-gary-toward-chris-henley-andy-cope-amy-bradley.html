  <title>The Art of Being a Brilliant NQT - Gary Toward, Chris Henley, Andy Cope, Amy Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everything a NQT always wanted to know about starting their teaching career but never dared to ask! This book will take the NQT through a journey which starts with interviews, leads them through the first visit before taking up the job and then into the first hectic weeks and months. Light in touch but rich in content, it can be read around the pool during the holidays before the start of term or kept by the bedside or in a desk drawer for an emergency flick through once teaching gets underway! It expands on the stuff that teacher training touches on, but importantly provides a refreshing look at the nitty-gritty stuff that most training doesn&#39;t! A brilliant book for NQTs." />
