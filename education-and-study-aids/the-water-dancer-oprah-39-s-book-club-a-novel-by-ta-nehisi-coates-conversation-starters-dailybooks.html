      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Water Dancer (Oprah&amp;#39;s Book Club): A Novel by&amp;nbsp;Ta-Nehisi Coates: Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Set in the 1800s, before the start of the Civil War, The Water Dancer is the first fiction novel by author Ta-Nehisi Coates. The book is a story of a young boy named Hiram Walker, born in slavery, in the plantations of antebellum Virginia. Hiram has a photographic memory but doesn&amp;rsquo;t remember his mother as she was sold by his father to the plantation owner when Hiram was young. He is also the possessor of a superhuman ability called &amp;lsquo;Conduction&amp;rsquo; which gives him the power to travel across great distances in a short span of time through water bodies. With his newfound ability, Hiram pledges to fight the war between the oppressed i.e. enslaved and the oppressor i.e. slavers, and help others escape the confines of slavery.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The book released in September 2019 garnered numerous accolades which include becoming the #1 New York Times bestseller and getting featured in the&amp;rsquo; Oprah&amp;rsquo;s book club&amp;rsquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;

EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;These questions can be used to create hours of conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&amp;bull; Foster &lt;/b&gt;a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
