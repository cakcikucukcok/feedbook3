  <title>The Mayor of Casterbridge by Thomas Hardy (Book Analysis) - Bright Summaries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Unlock the more straightforward side of &lt;i&gt;The Mayor of Casterbridge&lt;/i&gt; with this concise and insightful summary and analysis!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This engaging summary presents an analysis of &lt;i&gt;The Mayor of Casterbridge&lt;/i&gt; by Thomas Hardy, one of the author&#39;s famed Wessex novels. It tells the story of the titular character, an upright but temperamental man who earlier sold his wife and daughter on a drunken whim. In the two decades that have passed since then, he has risen from humble beginnings to become respected and wealthy, but he finds that in the end his past catches up with him. Like much of Hardy&#39;s work, &lt;i&gt;The Mayor of Casterbridge &lt;/i&gt;challenges Victorian conceptions of morality and explores themes that remain relevant today, including the limitations of the institution of marriage and the differing standards applied to men and woman.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find out everything you need to know about &lt;i&gt;The Mayor of Casterbridge&lt;/i&gt; in a fraction of the time!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;This in-depth and informative reading guide brings you:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;oA complete plot summary&lt;br&gt;oCharacter studies&lt;br&gt;oKey themes and symbols&lt;br&gt;oQuestions for further reflection&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Why choose BrightSummaries.com?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;Available in print and digital format, our publications are designed to accompany you on your reading journey.
