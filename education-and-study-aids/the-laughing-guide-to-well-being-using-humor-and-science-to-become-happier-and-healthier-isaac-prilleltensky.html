  <title>The Laughing Guide to Well-Being: Using Humor and Science to Become Happier and Healthier - Isaac Prilleltensky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Do you experience stress? Are you interested in better health and well-being? Do you pursue happiness? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you need to read this book. If you answered no, you&amp;rsquo;re in denial. All of us can use a little help to become happier or healthier. Unfortunately, the help we get is often too scary: &amp;ldquo;if you don&amp;rsquo;t do this or that, some catastrophic event of epic proportions will happen.&amp;rdquo; Prilleltensky&amp;rsquo;s approach, in contrast, is to help you become healthier and happier through laughter. In this hilarious book, Prilleltensky combines humor with science to help you improve your well-being. Each chapter consists of the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Laughing Side&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a series of funny stories; and the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Learning Side&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, a research-based, user-friendly guide to health and happiness. The first chapter provides an overview of well-being, while subsequent chapters cover each of its six domains: Interpersonal, Community, Occupational, Physical, Psychological, and Economic (I COPPE). When you finish the book you&amp;rsquo;ll have a greater understanding of your life, and ways to make it better. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
