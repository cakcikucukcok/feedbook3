  <title>Who Is in Your Ears - Bako Ambianda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains powerful philosophies and theological perspectives in simple yet enlightening ways. If you were waiting for the right time, this is the time for the best to come out from you. If you read this book and complain about the same things, then you might as well go lie in the graveyard and dont invite us to the funeral. I laugh, but I phrase it this way because I was the same way. Im coming to you as a young man who had a dream to impact peoples lives and who endured so much emotional distress to achieve my dreams. When I told my friends what I wanted to accomplishthat I was going to become an author, I was going to have my own company, I was going to win a scholarship, I was going to speak and host events, I was going to travel around the USA attending conferencesmany friends looked at me and laughed because I was saying all those things when I didnt even have a car, much less any plan to go after what I wanted. Some friends discouraged me because I have an accent, and they said nobody is going to listen to me when I speak. But I held on to the one person who always says its possible. You can live your dream. This book is about finding someone whose voice inspires you, makes you stronger, and kicks you into action to work toward your dreams. Yes, God is our redeemer, he is our savior, and he makes a way when there seems to be no way. I am a firm believer that God always helps those who help themselves. God wants to see you go out there and have a mentor who can train you, coach you, and work with you. If God sees how much you are dedicated in making your life better, he will always be around to guide you in the right direction. So by the end of reading this book, you will be inspired to act with your heart. Every dreamer needs to read this book. The world is a better place because you showed up." />
