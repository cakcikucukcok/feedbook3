  <title>Nightingale Online Praxis and Prevention of Cyber Attacks - Dr. Mercy M. Popoola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nightingale is best known for her work during the Crimean War, especially her praxis with promoting cleanliness, preventing infection, and publications about the relationship between hygiene and infections. Majority of the time, hackers cannot get to our computer and steal our information and disrupt our life or online learning process if the computer is not infected. Therefore, if we can use or transfer Nightingale zeal as a reformer and educator for infection control to the world of technology and online learning, we can fight computer virus and prevent our computer from virus infections, which can prevent cyber attacks from hackers. Praxis is a critical thinking process that can be applied to any daily decision-making process, such as deciding whether or not it is smart to download a free online program or click on an unknown link or lock computer to prevent our computer from being infected, just as Nightingale fought for years to prevent infections. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For praxis to be experienced, we often start with a question such as &quot;How do we get these two boards to stick together?&quot; We then theorize on the different methods to use, such as incorporating glue, nails, etc. We make a final decision based on support, research, engineering, weight, and longevity, and we decide to use nails. We measure and remeasure the mark at which the nail will enter the wood. We choose the correct size of the nail, grab our hammer, and aim. With the hammer, we drive the nail into and through the wood. The process of selecting the nail and making the decision to hammer the nail is praxis. &lt;/p&gt;" />
