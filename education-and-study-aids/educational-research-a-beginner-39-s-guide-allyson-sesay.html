  <title>Educational Research: a Beginner&#39;s Guide - Allyson Sesay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book presents a rudimentary exposure
to the fi eld of educational research and an
attempt to allay the unwarranted fear of those
who perceive research as a highly technical
and complex scholarly activity carried out
by persons in the sciences. The author takes
the position that anyone can do research and
that it can be an interesting and very worthwhile experience.
Educational research, particularly action research, which the
author emphasizes, is an invaluable exercise about which
everyone in education should be knowledgeable or at least be
familiar. Starting with an explication of some salient concepts
in the study of research (e.g., research, educational research,
research problem v. research topic, hypothesis, experimental v.
non-experimental research) , the book takes the reader through
the process of conducting a research problem  from problem
selection and statement, signifi cance, review of literature,
methodology, data analysis, fi ndings to recommendations
and conclusions. Detailed descriptions of the American
Psychological Association (APA) style of referencing with ample
examples are provided. The book is written in simple language
so that even high school students will be able to acquire a fairly
good understanding of each contents. Though the primary
target population is undergraduate students of education, the
contents are broad enough to provide a guide for students in
other disciplines, as well as whet the appetite of the general
reader who seeks only a basic knowledge of research and/or
educational research." />
