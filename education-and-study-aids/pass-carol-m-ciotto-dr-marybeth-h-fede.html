  <title>Pass - Carol M. Ciotto, Dr. Marybeth H. Fede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether an administrator, faculty member, classroom teacher, or special area teacher, everyone wants to see their students learning improve. Improved learning validates the roles and influences of educators and administrators. The purpose of this book is to assist educators in how to create a physically active school. Understanding the role physical activity and/or movement plays in the gymnasium and the classroom will contribute significantly to this effort. Movement helps to differentiate instruction, by increasing retention, motivation, attention, and engagement in the learning process. It should be utilized for its full potential benefits in both the classroom and gymnasium. 
The solution begins and ends with the decisions we make. Children are not getting as much physical activity as they should, despite the many benefits. It is important to establish good physical activity habits as early as possible. So how do we do that? By making physical activity and quality physical education a part of your schools culture by increasing the amount of physical activity students participate in throughout the day, every day. It is critical that we take the steps now to educate and make a change in our students lives to help them lead a healthier, more productive life." />
