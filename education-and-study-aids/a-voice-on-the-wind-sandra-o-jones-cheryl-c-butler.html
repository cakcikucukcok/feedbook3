      <meta name="description" content="If you could: take away one bad thing; replace it with 2-3 good things that is not only healthier, wealthier and wiser, would you? If making even the smallest change could prolong life and happiness, would you. Better yet, could you? This series is a veritable fruit cocktail of knowledge. There is nothing better than natures pure bounty. Why not explore the vast regions of this good earth and taste what nature has put here for us. Plain, simple, exotic and complex fruits, abound. Ever hear of a Sop apple? Or have you ever seen the cashew apple? Did you know there are 7500 different apples? Apples that dont even look like what we know, as apples. Our first book explores the apple and some of the things we never knew about them." />
