  <title>Eisenhower in Command at Columbia - Douglas E. Clark, Marybeth Gasman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dwight D. Eisenhower&amp;rsquo;s presidency of Columbia University (1948-1953) is among the least written about periods of his career. It is all but dismissed by historians as a mere interlude between his service as World War II&amp;rsquo;s most celebrated general and his two terms as president of the United States. His Columbia tenure was marked by extended absences from campus and ongoing political speculation regarding a run for the White House in 1952. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Eisenhower in Command at Columbia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; disputes the conventional wisdom that Eisenhower&amp;rsquo;s Columbia presidency was unsuccessful. In fact, under his leadership, Columbia moved forward in several important areas. Eisenhower&amp;rsquo;s tenure at Columbia was, nevertheless, difficult at times. His lack of both academic experience and a full understanding of academic culture diminished his capacity to lead and damaged his credibility with faculty. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;While the book brings historical perspective to Eisenhower&amp;rsquo;s presidency of Columbia, its primary purpose is to analyze Eisenhower&amp;rsquo;s tenure in the context of higher education leadership. His experience at Columbia is relevant today because it demonstrates the importance of understanding institutional culture when leading a college or university. His selection as the university&amp;rsquo;s president reveals flaws in the process that still plague boards today in what is arguably their most important job &amp;mdash;selecting an institution&amp;rsquo;s leader. This book will appeal to scholars in higher education, history, and university administration, among others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
