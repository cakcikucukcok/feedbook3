  <title>Making Lemonade - Laura J. Colker, Derry Koralek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;The concept of learned optimism, while well established in research, is relatively unknown in teacher education and in early childhood classrooms and family child care practice. &lt;i&gt;Making Lemonade&lt;/i&gt; is a first-to-market book that offers a straightforward, easy-to-do approach to help develop optimism in young children.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making Lemonade&lt;/i&gt; is not about convincing children everything will be okay, but rather changing how you react to conflict and setbacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very practical activities for families, early childhood classroom teachers and family child care providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimisim is associated with resiliency in both children and adults and is a major protector against depression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There will be a section to help adults use the same approach to make themselves optimistic thinkers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activities include planning and putting on puppet shows and dramatic play scenarios featuring characters who solve problems through optimistic thinking, writing or drawing about positive events to place in a gratitude box, and reading and talking about books that feature optimism, such as &lt;i&gt;When Pigs Fly&lt;/i&gt; by Valerie Coulman.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dr. Laura J. Colker, president of L.J. Colker &amp; Associates, has been an early childhood author, trainer, and lecturer for 45 years. She has authored or coauthored over 150 articles and books, including &lt;i&gt;The Creative Curriculum for Preschool&lt;/i&gt;, now in its sixth edition, is the most widely used preschool curriculum in the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Derry Koralek was the chief publishing officer for the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) where she also served as editor-in-chief for two NAEYC award-winning periodicals, &lt;i&gt;Young Children&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Teaching Young Children&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This book is grounded in research and utilizes the work of Martin Seligman and the successful approach of the Penn Resiliency Project (PRP) working with school-age children and Canada’s RIRO (Reaching Out . . . Reaching In) in applying PRP’s approach to children ages 2-1/2 to 8 years old.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Making Lemonade&lt;/i&gt; features activities that have been field-tested in a diverse group of early childhood programs. The teachers and children in the pilot test represented the public, military, and private programs, including Head Start and the military’s overseas program Sure Start (which is based on the Head Start model).&lt;/li&gt;" />
