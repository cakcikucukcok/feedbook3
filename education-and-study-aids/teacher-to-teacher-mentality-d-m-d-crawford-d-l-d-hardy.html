  <title>Teacher to Teacher Mentality - D M. D Crawford, D L. D Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This text focuses upon professional discourse that revolves around induction efforts resulting from educators working together to inform one another&amp;rsquo;s practice. Teacher to teacher mentality is the product of purposeful practice as educators serve to inform one another&amp;rsquo;s preparation and development. Further, such mentality transcends boundaries to reach all levels of education and across contexts with cutting edge research and applications that promote the classroom teacher as associated teacher educator in the process. Therefore, this text is meant as a reflection of the current &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;state of the profession&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and future research and development prospects pertaining to the concept of classroom teachers as associated teacher educators who through teacher to teacher mentality inform purposeful practice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; This text serves also as a tool for promoting professional discourse concerning the classroom teachers as associated teacher educators in this regard. This is such an important discussion to be had, and yet only recently has the teacher education profession more fully realized, acknowledged and emphasized the integral impact of teacher to teacher mentality of classroom teachers as associated teacher educators engaged in purposeful practice. Such dynamic interchanges of teacher to teacher mentality extend to teacher candidates, novice classroom teachers, and teacher educators.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
