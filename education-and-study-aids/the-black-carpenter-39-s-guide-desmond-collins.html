  <title>The Black Carpenter&#39;s Guide - Desmond Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was written with the black, African American, carpenter in mind. There are many books out there about construction but none that talk about the issues that confront the black carpenters.
The subject matter in this book is laid out in a well thought out and progressive manner. Many hours of dedication and care have gone into its completion. It starts with developing the right mindset. From this foundation all the necessary character traits essential for success in the construction field are explained clearly in simple language. Next we explore the Black Contractors Association and the resources available for innercity black men and women seeking training in the construction trades. Since its conception its goal has been the training of master builders and tradesmen from the labor pool of black communities. Learn about apprenticeship training and the differences between the apprenticeship programs. Staying healthy and avoiding injuries explains correct lifting techniques that prevent serious back injuries, as well as the different types of PPE, an acronym for personal protective equipment that is designed to protect you the worker from injuries.
Then we jump into the Union versus non-union companies, and go into detail about the benefits of belonging to the United Brotherhood of Carpenters or the AGC Associated General Contractors of America and will inform you on how to make an informed decision on which one will make more sense depending on your goals and career paths. You will also find out about the tools of the trade: what tools you should purchase, the bags you should wear and the clothing and PPEs that are required to work on construction sites. We explore details about cordless and specialty tools and the different brands that carpenters use out in the field. Discover the different building materials used in the construction field.
Learn about the different applications that fasteners can be used in on a building and what ones work best in special circumstances. Building systems reveals modern construction practices and systems carpenters and tradesmen use today out in the construction field to construct buildings and structures. Trade Specializations takes a look at all the different trades and specializations the construction field offers black workers. In applying at job-sites I will reveal how to get hired in two weeks or less when applying for work at construction sites. Determine how far you should travel when seeking employment and how to get compensated for traveling expenses. In Discrimination in the Industry we uncover how racially motivated politics is used to exclude blacks and minorities from management positions in the construction industry.
I will also teach you how to resolve and report racial discrimination directed toward you on job-sites. In Staying Productive, we learn how a high level of energy and production can keep you employed for the long term. In Certifications &amp; Trainings the reader will explore what the difference is between the two and what programs will help advance the workers career. Preparing for the contractors exam give the reader a detailed road map and the requirements to prepare to pass the states contractor exam. Continue Learning reviews the learning process and how to continue to ask the right questions and develop a lifelong education plan that will advance your career for years to come. Construction Terms is a glossary of housing terms used in the construction field. Learning and memorizing these terms will give you an inside look at the language used by carpenters and builders in
construction. These terms will also allow you to see how building materials and construction applications come together in a construction project. More about the Author is a short bio on how I arrived in the construction field as a carpenter." />
