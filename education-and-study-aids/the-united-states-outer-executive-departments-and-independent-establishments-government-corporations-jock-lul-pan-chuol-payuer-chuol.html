  <title>The United States Outer Executive Departments and Independent Establishments &amp; Government Corporations - Jock Lul Pan Chuol, Payuer Chuol</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Book is overview of Outer executive Departments and 64 Independent Federal Agencies; the Outer Executive Departments are--United States Department of Interior, Labor, Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services, Transportation, Education, and Veterans Affairs. In the 64 Federal Independent Agencies,  some are larger than many Departments; for instance, United States Postal Services employs 656, 000; ranks third next to Wal-Mart and Department of Defense that employs 700,000 civilians. 
Accordingly, it had been my journey to know the governmental agencies; for me, the local and states basic social service administration never been satisfactory if I dont know inside  the United States Department of Health and Human Services category of its agencies.  Because of that, it influences my learning and leads me made further research on governmental agencies. In these ten Outer Executive Department and 64 Independent Agencies--which I put together as  a Policy of Federal Independent Agencies and Federal Outer Executive Departments, paved my way to supplementary learning on Public Services and would leads me makes further researches on  States, local and Cities governments agencies.   
This Book can be used by Graduates and Post Graduates students as special topic on Federal Agencies/be second Book in different classes, or be main text in certain levels, and it also can be Handbook for Public Administrators, United States Congress who creates and defines the Agencies Policy and Mission, from 2nd to 111th Congresses, and to the Heads of these Agencies, and states Administrators, Directors, Public Managers and any interested individual who want to learn more on Governmental Agencies. 
The Heads and Staff of these Departments and Agencies may know more mainly on ones or more Agencies than the Policy on this Book, but they can easily Master other Departments and Agencies like their owns if they have this Book on hand. Bases on my believe, Graduate students from Public Administration, Political Science, Sociology, Psychology, Social Work, Law, and International Relation etc never apprehend all agencies specifically as how I put and illustrate them;  except their Agencies.  I always cross these agencies in different books, but nothing enough enlighten me how the Agencies and Policies are; now I am clearly sure on agencies policy, roles and organizations, etc. This Pans 2nd Book as well as first Book is away beyond Administrative Laws and Administrative Ethic and Leadership.
