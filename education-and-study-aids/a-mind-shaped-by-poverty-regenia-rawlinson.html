  <title>A Mind Shaped by Poverty - Regenia Rawlinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Children who live in poverty want the same things other children wantto be treated with respect and given equal opportunities. Unfortunately, many students living in poverty enter school with barriers that interfere with learning and make it more dif?cult for them to achieve. In the essential guide &lt;i&gt;A Mind Shaped by Poverty: Ten Things Educators Should Know&lt;/i&gt;, educator Regenia Rawlinson shares a comprehensive look at how poverty affects academic success and what educators can do to solve the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rawlinson draws on thirty years of experience as a teacher, school counselor, and district administrator as she explores ten phenomena that will help other educators understand the ways in which living in poverty has the potential to shape a childs mind. While offering strategies for teachers to help students overcome the effects of a debilitating indigent mindset, Rawlinson also shares compelling details from her own poverty-stricken childhood and how her own experiences shaped her beliefs about herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Mind Shaped by Poverty: Ten Things Educators Should Know&lt;/i&gt; helps teachers enhance students confidence, improve academic achievement, and most importantly, banish the negative effects of a poverty mindset.&lt;/p&gt;" />
