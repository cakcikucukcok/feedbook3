In these secret societies there are activities and requirements that cause prospective members and members aliketo unknowingly enter into ungodly pacts and covenants. These ungodly practices lead to activities which include physical abuse, fornication, adultery, hatred, envy, strife, manipulation, social and intellectual elitism, abominable sexual activities and witchcraft. These organizationsattract people that are looking for something that only Christ Jesus can provide. However, the organizations appears as a light by their community service and networking abilities. This light however is afalse light.Once one gets into the inner workings of the organizations, the sin and soul inflicting antics are found deeply rooted in darkness. The authorsbeing former members that participated in ungodly activities within these organizations expose the physical, mental, sexualand spiritualdeath-dealing activities found in fraternities and sororities. This is by no means a kiss and tell composition, but it is a trying to save people from hell exposition. Actual accounts of sexual requirements, abuse,ancient ungodly spiritual practices, witchcraft, and required chantswhich denouncetheexistence the One True God are given in detail in this book.Ungodly spirits of oldhave found new vessels to operate inthrough these fraternities and sororities. The good thing about this book is that it not only exposes spiritual wickedness and old ungodly practices, but it shows people who want to be free how to find God, the Ancient of Days.Let the Truth be told. We encourage you to read this book if you arejoining a fraternity or sorority, are a member of one, are apastor, orhave a loved one in one of these organizations.
