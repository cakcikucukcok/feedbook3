  <title>Living on a Two Way Street in the System - Craig Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written to help students who are facing challenges in their lives succeed in the school system. Students gaining insights from peers, were important outcomes linked to how to become leaders. I believe it was accomplished by creating an atmosphere where students can dream, believe, and be energized in learning. In knowing the dynamics about me that only can be given by God that had a personal relationship in building confidence to convince my students that He will make a way out of no way in their lives. The process for writing has been challenging but I know that God gave me a vision that inspired me. He drove me to do the things by accepting and inspiring me to bring people closer to Him. God placed me in this place to be a role model. I have spent nearly twenty years of my life being a leader. Leadership creates change in students to believe in taking chances that could change their lives. Students witnessed some dynamic gifts of confidence in me convincing them that God would make a way. A result of this gift gave me the capability to encourage my students to become leaders. Ultimately, the core role of an educator is just like what my pastor said to me that, God set me apart to be a leader and make life better for someone else." />
