  <title>How to Get &#39;&#39;A&#39;&#39; Grades in School - Angel N. Pagaduan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For its self-effusing utilitarian value and global appeal as a pragmatic guide to productive learning that resulted from a 30-year cumulative teaching exposure to almost every nature of all-grade-level classroom situations, this book is of a kind every home will particularly want to have. Even at the time of its writing, students eager to peek outright into its pivotally-concocted, stimuli-rich recipe for successful learning interestedly reacted, commenting It has many good points!, Theres none like it!, Its very helpful!, and Ill buy it! Friends had intimated that the book could well be treasured as a resource useful not only to students but also to parents and budding/novice teachers worldwide who desire to help youngsters become better learners. How-to-learn-well guide materials in varying forms exist in schools, but their separately organized, non-motivational, or invariably monotonous tone sounds to be all but effectively inspirational. Fundamentally an incidental consolidation of the guiding shades of such materials, this book dovetails into their supposed common end objective of effecting fruitful learningbut by a particular way designed to comprehensively instill in students psyche a viably lasting learning interest expected to systematically evolved into an inveterate spirit of self-motivated/-inspired study habit. That it is capsulatedcompositely from hands-on perspectives based on work experienced in all grade levels including preschool and classes organized primarily for adults into a compact but all-encompassing coverage of only some 70 pages conveniently digestible in just a few settings of purposeful reading adds weight to its behooving worth. Students reading it would metamorphose into A-1 learners not outright, but they would surely transform into being so once they start taking action with time all through it." />
