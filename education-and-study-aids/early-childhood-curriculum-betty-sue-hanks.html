&lt;P&gt;Early Childhood Curriculum&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The &lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;Early Childhood Curriculum &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;book consists of sequential developmental skills&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;and activities. Each age group (0-6 months) and (6-12 months) contains a theme&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;with different activities for the infant, and the units follow these themes. This&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;curriculum is arranged and organized to ensure that cognitive, physical,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;emotional, language and social areas are addressed. Activities are&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;developmentally appropriate, so that the children can receive the best possible&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;stimulation. This book contains lessons, ideas, and activities that any person&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;would be able to use. People, including parents, presenters, school administrators,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;graduate students, staff members in childcare laboratories, and early childhood&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;teachers, are all individuals that could benefit from using this curriculum.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This curriculum contains units and ideas that are simple and easy to&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;understand, so that readers, parents and teachers, can use it on a daily basis, both&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;in the classroom and at home. It is functional and pleasing to the eye, and it&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;covers quality, not just quantity. This curriculum is also unique because it is user&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;friendly. The simplicity is convenient for our readers&#39; and professionals&#39; busy&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;schedules. Parents and professionals rarely have the time or luxury of&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;uninterrupted periods to sit, read, and search through and pull out the&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;information that is needed. This simplified version gives them that opportunity.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The latest research shows that between birth to three years of age is the time&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;when a child&#39;s mental capacity is the greatest. Research illustrates that if positive&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;and appropriate stimulation of a child&#39;s mind is provided, the child will become a&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;better-rounded individual. Recent research also supports the link between&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;literacy and school success; literacy refers to reading and writing skills, and&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;building oral language skills, such as listening and speaking. Childcare providers&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;can foster the development of literacy in children. Strategies used to develop&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;reading and writing include: listening to stories, reading stories, talking and&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;listening to children, playing sound games, saying nursery rhymes, singing songs,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;singing and saying words that rhyme, using phonetic sounds, exploring rhythms,&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;scribbling, and verbally labeling objects and events. Caregivers and parents can&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;use seasonal songs, rhymes and stories throughout the year. Also, choose and use&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;age appropriate toys, songs, rhymes, and books that go along with the themes and&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;units in the curriculum. The appropriate books to use with infants are board&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;books and plastic books with real photos that can be seen easily.&lt;/P&gt;
