  <title>Teaching Amidst the Neon Palm Trees - Lee Ryan Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;A SHOCKING INDICTMENT OF OUR SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE POLITICS THAT PERMEATE IT.&quot; -Raymond Shaffer, Nevada State Senator&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lee Miller was a popular young professor in Las Vegas who thought he was on the fast-track to tenure. He had created an innovative study abroad program with the help of a distinguished U.S. senator, and had found funding for needy students wishing to participate. It was just his first year at the college, and the newspapers already had reported on his work. Little did he know that someone had other plans for the money earmarked for the needy students ... someone who would stop at nothing to crush Millers plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This true story reads like a novel. Miller weaves an amusing tale of teaching at a community college in &quot;Sin City&quot; with the unpredictable twists and turns of a scandal involving some of the most powerful figures in the state ... a scandal that threatens to end the careers of several administrators at the college.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book is extremely entertaining and very accurate. It is a very good read.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Steve Sisolak, Regent, 
University and Community College System of Nevada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BOOK. IT SHOULD SERVE TO PREVENT SUCH MADNESS FROM OCCURRING AT OTHER COLLEGES.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Alexander Greenfeld, former Professor, 
University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LEE RYAN MILLER has taught political science and economics for more than a decade at colleges and universities in the United States and Japan. He is the author of two political science books. He also has written two epic fantasy novels (as yet unpublished). He resides in Modesto, California.
