  <title>Can You Hear the Animals? Book One: the Mcpherson Family - Tracey Kehler, Kara LaRose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Can You Hear the Animals? Book One: The McPherson Family&lt;/i&gt; is a rhyming, easy-to-grasp story of interspecies communication. Written simply enough for very young readers, it holds deep messages that can provoke emotions and thoughts for readers of any age, from laughter to tears to pleasant surprises and endless possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concepts are designed to introduce you and your children to a whole world of communication with animals and all life. This is a picture book chock-full of messages for young and old alike, written with humor and sensitivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all animal communicators. Inspired by a true desire to help you and your children discover this concept, there are both obvious and hidden messages for you to uncover. It is hoped that, whatever you and your child take from this collection of heart-warming animal-talk stories, that the final outcome will create a new awareness and a sense of compassion, empathy, and respect, in essence, for all life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known Tracey for over fifteen years, and as a fellow empath, I can testify that she is an authentic animal medium, speaking, feeling, and acting on their behalves. We are blessed to have her working to assist our animal companions, and she deserves our support. &lt;/p&gt;
