  <title>Fear - J. Ibeh Agbanyim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fear is powerful, and it has a presence in whatever we do in lifewhether that is passing our exams, keeping peace in our homes, or simply adjusting to the constantly changing world. In Fear, author J. Ibeh Agbanyim offers a guidebook that portrays fear as a healthy emotionas long as it is well managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;Demonstrating practical ways that fear can work in our favor instead of working against us, Agbanyim focuses on the importance of using fear as a healthy emotion to achieve goals on a daily basis. He discusses techniques for believing in constructive fear, evaluating the quality of fear, adjusting to the conditions of life, and entertaining the notion that even Jesus feared. Through a step-by-step process, Agbanyim offers ways to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;believe that a change of feeling is a change of destiny;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;constructively adjust to changing conditions;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;embrace the inconvenient truth;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn how to forgive; and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;learn how to sing a song when in the valley of tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear presents valuable tools, practical techniques, and relevant advice for anyone willing to experience new vision and information for self-discovery that can lead to living a life of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Agbanyims text on fear is an intriguingly different approach to the construct of fear that may shift the paradigms of thinking on the topic. While I hold strong opinions against viewing fear as a positive emotion, I believe you will find this text worth exploring. It has the potential to contribute new imagination and information to the body of knowledge on fear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear is the fundamental instinct of every human being and the greatest fear of all is the fear of death. One of the first steps to living a fulfilled life is to conquer your own fears. Those who dont, risk ruining their lives due to fear or False Expectations Appearing Real. I applaud Mr. Agbanyim for taking on this tough subject and sharing his in-depth knowledge and inspiring stories. His book allows readers to recognize the virus called fear within various aspects of daily life and also provides a constructive outlook of overcoming it.&lt;/p&gt;
