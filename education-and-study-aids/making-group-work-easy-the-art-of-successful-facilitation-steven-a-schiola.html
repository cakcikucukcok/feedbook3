  <title>Making Group Work Easy: The Art of Successful Facilitation - Steven A. Schiola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The latest research about improving education shows that when educators work together to examine data, brainstorm strategies, implement those strategies, and check the data again, student achievement rises. These processes are well known and effective. What is often overlooked or taken for granted is the process the educators will use to work with one another and find effective solutions. It is easy to say that educators will just meet with each other and work these things out. However, as we have learned with students, people are not born with all of the skills to work in teams. This book teaches a process that will help both teachers and administrators plan for and conduct meetings that are meaningful, useful, and that generate results." />
