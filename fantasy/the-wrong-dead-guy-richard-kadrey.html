  <title>The Wrong Dead Guy - Richard Kadrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this fast paced sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Everything Box&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;the second entry in &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Richard Kadrey&amp;#8217;s comedic supernatural series&amp;#8212;chaos ensues when Coop and the team at DOPS steal a not-quite-dead and very lovesick ancient Egyptian mummy wielding some terrifying magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coop, a master thief sort of gone legit, saved the world from an ancient doomsday device&amp;#8212;heroism that earned him a gig working for the Department of Peculiar Science, a fearsome top secret government agency that polices the odd and strange. Now Woolrich, Coop&amp;#8217;s boss at the DOPS, has Coop breaking into a traveling antiquities show to steal a sarcophagus containing the mummy of a powerful Egyptian wizard named Harkhuf. With the help of his pals Morty, Giselle, and a professor that&amp;#8217;s half-cat, half-robotic octopus, Coop pulls off the heist without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s not Coop&amp;#8217;s fault that when DOPS opened the sarcophagus they didn&amp;#8217;t find the mummy they were expecting. Well, it was the right mummy, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t exactly dead&amp;#8212;and now it&amp;#8217;s escaped, using a type of magic the organization hasn&amp;#8217;t encountered before. Being a boss, Woolrich blames his underling for the screw up and wants Coop to find the missing Harkhuf and make it right, pronto. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Digging into Harkhuf&amp;#8217;s history, Coop thinks the mummy is hunting for an ancient magical manuscript that will help him bring his old lover back to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which wouldn&amp;#8217;t be so bad if she wasn&amp;#8217;t a warrior sorceress hell-bent on conquering the world with her undead armies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coop would very much like to run from the oncoming chaos. It&amp;#8217;s one thing to steal a mummy, but another to have to deal with head-hunting bureaucrats, down-on-their luck fortune tellers, undead mailroom clerks, and a rather unimpressed elephant. Unfortunately, there&amp;#8217;s nowhere to run. If he wants the madness to stop, he&amp;#8217;s going to have to suck it up and play hero one more time. But if Coop manages to save the world AGAIN, he&amp;#8217;s definitely going to want a lot of answers. And a raise.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Coop is a thief who works for the Department of Paranormal Science (DOPS). Tasked with stealing a mummy, things naturally go sideways and Coop becomes the target of a mummy’s curse.<br /><b><i>The Wrong Dead Guy (Another Coop Heist): Kadrey, Richard ...</i></b> | The Wrong Dead Guy has taught me never to underestimate an author who has been immortalized with his own action figure. This series sets the bar for absurd humor exceptionally high. Even with plenty of death and destruction on display, this is laugh-out-loud funny stuff, as Kadrey proves himself a master of manic, rapid-fire storytelling, hilarious wisecracks, and relentless supernatural lunacy .<br /><b><i>The Wrong Dead Guy — Richard Kadrey</i></b> | Richard Kadrey is another of those authors for me. The Wrong Dead Guy is the second in a series following Coop, a supernatural thief. He’s not so much supernatural as are the items he steals. It also helps that magic and spells don’t seem to affect him.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Wrong Dead Guy - Richard Kadrey</a> </h3></p><hr/>
