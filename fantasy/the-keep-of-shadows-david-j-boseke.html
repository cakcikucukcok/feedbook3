  <title>The Keep of Shadows - David J. Boseke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Nations of the Young Kingdoms had not felt the anguish of war for nearly twenty years. Now, with a massive barbarian army poised to invade Aljamin, just one walled city, Akaar, guards the large Kingdoms borders. The city lies exposed and vulnerable to invasion. Defenseless.&lt;p&gt;
With their land in chaos, Sinjin Storm and his trusted companions set out to rally allies to help defend their country. Taken under the wing of Sorrell Tovaal, a powerful wizard, Storm begins to have visions and is beset with questions. Mysterious occurrences confound his questions as long-held secrets begin to be revealed. With unwavering courage, Storm encounters assassins, beasts, and dark figures from the Dead Wood forest that seem bent on his destruction.&lt;p&gt;
As the invasion intensifies, Storm and his allies realize the barbarian hordes are merely pawns in a war between two powerful, yet parallel worlds. The Young Kingdoms quickly realize that dark forces are working furiously in this other world, poised and waiting for the chance to bring an age of darkness and chaos to the human world. Storm must quickly discover and develop his powers as a wizard and his courage as a man. Only then can he master the only force capable of sealing the breech between the two worlds." />
