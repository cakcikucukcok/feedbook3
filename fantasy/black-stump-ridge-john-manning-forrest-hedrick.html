  <title>Black Stump Ridge - John Manning, Forrest Hedrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For the past twelve years, Fred Kyle has wrapped whiskey-drenched clouds around him while hiding in a cheap motel in Austin, Texas. A knock on the door reveals a face from the past, and suddenly all of the horror and death of an ill-fated Thanksgiving hunting trip over a decade ago is swirling around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amanda Carlyle has been searching for Fred, her fathers former best friend, for two years. Not sure of what she expects to find on the other side of the motel room door, Amanda knocks, knowing she must face Fred in order to uncover the truth about what killed her father nearly twelve years ago. Was it really a hunting accident as Fred had told the police? Or was it something so evil that Fred has been crippled by the horrific memories ever since? But Amanda needs to knowone way or the otherand demands to know the real story behind the fatal events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Freds reluctant retelling comes hints of a heritage he has tried to ignore, the pull of the fiddles, and the realization that he must finally send back the evil he and his friends accidentally released long ago.&lt;/p&gt;" />
