  <title>Deep Down - Deborah Coates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now that she&#39;s solved her sister&#39;s murder, Hallie Michaels has left the army and isn&#39;t sure what to do next. Her relationship with deputy Boyd Davies is tentative, there&#39;s still distance between her and her father, and she needs a job. The good news is, she hasn&#39;t seen a ghost in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All that changes when she gets a call asking her to help an elderly neighbor who is being stalked by black dogs, creatures from the underworld that are harbingers of death. When a black dog appears, Hallie learns, a reaper is sure to follow. And if the dark visions she&#39;s suddenly receiving are any indication, it looks like the reaper is now following &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, strange events herald the arrival of ghosts from Boyd&#39;s past, ghosts the young deputy isn&#39;t ready to face. Refusing Hallie&#39;s help, Boyd takes off to deal with the problem on his own, only to find that he&#39;s facing something much larger and more frightening than he&#39;d imagined.&lt;br&gt;Stalked by a reaper and plagued by dark visions, Hallie finds she must face her fears and travel into Death&#39;s own realm to save those she most loves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deep Down&lt;/i&gt; is the chlling sequel to &lt;i&gt;Wide Open&lt;/i&gt;, Deborah Coates&#39;s &quot;refreshingly original dark fantasy debut.&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
