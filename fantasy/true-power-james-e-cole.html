  <title>True Power - James E. Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hello to whoever is reading this. Let me introduce myself. My name is Sean Soulflight. In these two stories youre going to read Im going to be telling you about my life at this new school I went to. In this time I learned a lot and taught a little too. I made friends, some of which I never expected. The real reason though that Im writing this story down
is because I want others to know what I know. Each story has a lesson that everybody should learn and situations that most people can relate to. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The two stories you are going to read are in order of the things that happened. The first is called the boy white hair and the second is called true power. By the time you finish reading this I hope you feel a little wiser and a whole lot more powerful. So without further ado, let the first story begin." />
