  <title>Salvation Showers of Blood - James Hendershot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lilith returns to reclaim her fresh throne, discovering that the god Bogovi has rebuilt a modern throne for them to rule their Empire, as they are still fighting Evil.  Lilith promotes her sisters to goddesses and builds a special sanctuary for their transcendent relationships.  As she settles in with her master, the dimensional throne recalls Bogovi for his spiritual testing.  Lilith now concentrates on discovering the mysterious history of one of her goddesses, searching the hidden sea of Wisdom where she discovers an Empire changing truth.  She must currently go back and free her last remaining daughter from the clutches of evil, starts the long hard War to liberate, and relocate Atlantis. Being charged with breaking inter-dimensional laws, her allies join the court hoping to free her from an eternity of damnation.  She now faces portal warfare, which allows evil to enter anywhere at will.  Using her new goddess of war, Iris, who commands the great armies victory soon, is reunited with Liliths Empire. As her previous dimension decays, Eve and Lablonta join Liliths Empire rebuilding hope and faith for all.  Bogovi completes his penance as the Empire now concentrates on providing 1,000s of more galaxies freedom and love." />
