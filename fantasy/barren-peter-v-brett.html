  <title>Barren - Peter V. Brett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Peter V. Brett returns to his groundbreaking Demon Cycle series with this enthralling novella&amp;#8212;the latest story set in his much-loved fantasy world.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each night, the world is overrun by bloodthirsty demons. For centuries, humanity survived only by hiding behind defensive wards&amp;#8212;magical symbols with the power to repel the demons. Now, the rediscovery of long-forgotten combat wards has given them the magic they need to fight back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tibbet&amp;#8217;s Brook, the fighting wards have brought change, but the factions and grudges of a troubled past remain. Selia Square, the woman they call Barren, has long been the force that holds the Brook together. As a terrifying new threat emerges, she rallies her people once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Selia has a past of her own. And in a small community the personal and the political can never be divided. If Tibbet&amp;#8217;s Brook is to survive, Selia must uncover memories she has buried deep&amp;#8212;the woman she once was, the woman she once loved&amp;#8212;and retell their story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
