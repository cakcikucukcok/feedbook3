  <title>Amortalis - Solomon Bagos Hood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ah, yes, those innocent years. As swords clash, and a rainbow of blood from creatures, innocent and guilty, paints the ground, I see myself, fighting others, and fighting the demon in front of me. And soon, I am knocked to the ground, staring into that face of a crone I once thought was beautiful. The witchin actions, not in birth, powers, et ceteraolder than I once apprehended, said something, probably something satirical on my behalf, and laid her sword on one side of my neck. I awaited the meeting of my Maker, if that was the afterlife for a soul so damaged as mine. I closed my eyes, hearing that hag cackle to herself, and I reminisced on my whole life in a matter of seconds.
	Angels, Demons, Mermaids, Werewolves, Genies, Dragons, Vampyres, Faeries, Harpies, Wizards, Witches, and Wraiths, all in one novel? (I know, right?) Add a seventeen-year-olds coming of age and you have one jam-packed, war-filled story. Lee wakes up years later after a weird transformation and voices in his head trying to guide him. He finds that humanity is a state of mind in the demon-created world he now is a part of and his family and friends are not what they seemed. This is not your normal high school fantasy tale in Amortalis" />
