  <title>Yoyo! Town Delinquents - Clive Alando Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cambelle Jones and Daniel Demark are two teenagers who are trying to use their ghetto-style entrepreneurial skills to get ahead in life, and they are always getting into trouble and out again just by their clever and sometimes ridiculous acts of wit, charm, and humour, which often finds them in uncompromising situationsthat is, until one day, when they find themselves in the middle of Norwich, far, far away from their South London habitat.
As the story unfolds, Daniel and Cambelle meet a girl, Bethany Yates, who invites them to a rave her ex-boyfriend Matthew Faversham is organizing, where it is suggested that they can make a lot of money with her help. But as the plot thickens, Daniel and Cambelle realize that they are totally out of place in this rural countryside community. Daniel takes a liking to Bethany and wants to maintain all links with her, but in truth, she is more interested in Cambelle. So in the process, she invites them up to Norwich to further their drug-dealing links with her circle of friends and ex-boyfriend.
The story opens up when both Daniel and Cambelle meet Bethanys father, Ethan Yates, which leads us to deal with the questions of race and class as both sides compete for intellectual superiority. And although Daniel and Cambelle, as the true underdogs, are outclassed, their characters still shine through. Their challenges of misfortune are also brought to another level as Bethanys ex-boyfriend also gets into a personal feud with Cambelle and Daniel." />
