&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Our
culture is rife with the inference of the existence of life on other
planets.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Indeed, life technologically
capable of visiting our planet on a regular basis.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Such visitation forms the core for a sizable
group of individuals who profoundly believe that they have seen, been visited
by or even abducted by Aliens.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;So
the fabric is woven into a tale of a common man whose destiny sends him out of
this world.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Jack
Sharpes a regular guy, jilted by his fianc hes drowning his sorrows at the
local pub, when his world is transformed by a gentleman offering him passage on
a space ship!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;The
man is Isiah Walker and hes a recruiter.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Isiah isnt recruiting just any down on his luck drunk.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Nope hes looking for a special type.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He seeks people without attachments.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Those who disappear and all thats said is:
Whatever happened to whats his name?&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Nobody with close family or close friends which narrows the field down
to what, maybe a couple of hundred million people?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Jack
fits and Isiah offers him a job working out in the suburbs of space, the
hinterlands of the galaxy.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Jack
considers the proposal even as events close in around him and send him where
our sun dont shine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Mankind
joins a race of galactic observers; beings that have watched us develop for
hundreds of years.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Theyve discovered
alien intruders so powerful and frightening they are forced into action.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;They must use Humanity to help destroy this
potential threat to the Universe.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The
race is devouring planets and taking the spoils to an unknown destination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;So
the journey begins and takes us into the everyday lives of the space borne
humans inhabiting an enormous craft designed and built by humans with Alien
technology.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;span style=&#39;mso-no-proof:yes&#39;&gt;Jack
learns about himself and his capabilities, hes mentally connected with a one hundred
ninety pound puppy of questionable breeding.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;He gains true friends and meets a very special woman.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As Jack and his group train hard for an
unknown mission their reward comes in the form of a one-way ticket to a planet
that is systematically being destroyed by the mysterious and hideous
aliens.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There they witness the Death of
a Planet a planet they will try desperately to save.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
