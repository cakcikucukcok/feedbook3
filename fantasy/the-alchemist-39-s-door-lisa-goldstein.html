  <title>The Alchemist&#39;s Door - Lisa Goldstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Scientist, mathematician, and court astrologer to Queen Elizabeth I, John Dee is also one of the sixteenth-century&#39;s most renowned alchemists, driven by a passion to fathom the elemental secrets of the cosmos. But when his reckless assistant, Edward Kelley, succeeds in using a crystal sphere to summon angels, Dee is catapulted into an awesome struggle that may extinguish the light of reason forever. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the spirits invoked is a cunning demon who takes possession of Dee&#39;s young daughter, Katherine, and shows Dee a frightening vision of his own future. Terrified by what has been foretold, Dee abruptly decides to close his house in London and flee to Europe with his long-suffering wife, Jane, and their two young children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their desperate flight brings them at last to the city of Prague--a center of culture, knowledge, and learning, both sacred and profane, a gateway between the Eastern and Western worlds, and also, it is whispered, a door between our world and the world of the spirits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There, in the city&#39;s ancient streets, Dee encounters the mystic Rabbi Judah Loew, who enlists his aid in the creation of a Golem--a man fashioned from the clay--to defend the city&#39;s Jewish Quarter from persecution. And he asks Dee&#39;s help to avert a impending crisis that threatens to engulf the world. For ancient legends say that the fate of the world rests on shoulders of thirty-six righteous men. And if one of those righteous men dies before his time, the world will end and dark spirits will remake it in their own image. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
