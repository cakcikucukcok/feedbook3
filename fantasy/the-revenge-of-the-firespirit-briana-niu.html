  <title>The Revenge of the Firespirit - Briana Niu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tragedy. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
The death of the father plunges Anary and her siblings lives into turmoil as they discover one secret after another and are thrown right into the middle of one of the kingdoms biggest conflicts in history. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Vengeance. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt; 
The FireSpirit, the long-feared scourge of the land has returned after centuries of absence. It has returned with greater power and fury than ever and Anary suspects it is out to acquire only one thing: Revenge. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Rebellion. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The FireSpirits return and increased power lead to suspicions that someone has turned traitor and may be assisting it- someone within the kingdom itself who may be biding their time for the kingdom&#39;s fall. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Peril. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With countless clashes against the FireSpirit and spy missions to seek out the traitor, Anary&#39;s new life is everything but safe. But the worst is yet to come- if the traitor and the FireSpirit are not stopped in time there will be only one outcome: War. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Adventure. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Join Anary and her siblings as they embark on one of the greatest adventures in history and attempt to stop the bane of their land before it is too late." />
