  <title>In the Shadow of the Gods - Rachel Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A breathtaking talent makes her debut with this first book in a dark epic fantasy trilogy, The Bound Gods, in which a mismatched band of mortals led by a violent, secretive man must stand against a pair of resentful gods to save their world. Part Patrick Rothfuss, part Joe&amp;#160;Abercrombie, magic and warfare collide in this powerful struggle for a broken world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eons ago, a pair of gods known as the Twins grew powerful in the world of Fiatera, until the Divine Mother and Almighty Father exiled them, binding them deep in the earth. But the price of keeping the fire lands safe is steep. To prevent these young gods from rising again, all twins in the land must be killed at birth, a safeguard that has worked until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trapped for centuries, the Twins are gathering their latent powers to break free and destroy the Parents for their tyranny&amp;#8212;to set off a fight between two generations of gods for control of the world and the mortals who dwell in it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the gods make war, only one side can be victorious. Joros, a mysterious and cunning priest, has devised a dangerous plan to win. Over eight years, he gathers a team of disparate fighters&amp;#8212;Scal, a lost and damaged swordsman from the North; Vatri, a scarred priestess who claims to see the future in her fires; Anddyr, a drug-addled mage wandering between sanity and madness; and Rora and Aro, a pair of twins who have secretly survived beyond the reach of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These warriors must learn to stand together against the unfathomable power of vengeful gods, to stop them from tearing down the sun . . . and plunging their world into darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
