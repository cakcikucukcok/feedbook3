  <title>Jack Shit - Wussla MacLoobi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This story is Wussla Macloobi&amp;#39;s creation from this joke that he read online one fine summer day:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hey you know many people wondered who is Jack Shit?&lt;br /&gt;
Well, I found out.&lt;br /&gt;
Jack Shit is the only son of Aww Shit, who married Miss Oh Shit, owners of &amp;quot;Knee-Deep In Shit Inc.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Then see, Jack Shit (son of Oh and Ahh Shit) married No Shit. The couple had six children: Holy Shit, Give a Shit, Full of Shit, Bullshit, and the twins, Deep Shit and Dip Shit!&lt;br /&gt;
Deep Shit married Dumb Shit, A College Dropout.&lt;br /&gt;
After 15 years Jack and No Shit divorced.&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. No Shit then married Ted Sherlock, and became No Shit Sherlock!&lt;br /&gt;
So the next time someone says &amp;quot;You Don&amp;#39;t Know Jack Shit!&amp;quot;, you can say &amp;quot;Yes I do actually!!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After reading it, Wussla Macloobi thought to himself, &amp;quot;But whatever became of his 6 children?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, this story of Jack Shit answers the question, &amp;quot;What about those 6 kids of his?&amp;quot; Nobody ever mentions them... UNTIL NOW! This compelling play-on-words short story joke delves into the family of Jack Shit to reveal his kids and what becomes of them, Jack, and several of the other members of his immediate and extended families. There is even an update as to what happened to the Knee-Deep-In-Shit Company! So sit back, get comfy and enjoy this witty, whimsical and vulgar off-color story!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Family trees are also included, making it easier and more fun to follow along!&lt;/p&gt;" />
