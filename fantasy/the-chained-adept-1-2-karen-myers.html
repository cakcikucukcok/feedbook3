Nothing but their empty tents remain, abandoned on the autumn steppe with their herds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#39;t a detour she&#39;d planned on making, but there&#39;s little choice. Winter is coming, and hundreds are missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locals don&#39;t trust her, but that&#39;s nothing new. The question is, can she trust herself, when she discovers what her life might have been? Assuming, of course, that the price of so many dead was worth paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
