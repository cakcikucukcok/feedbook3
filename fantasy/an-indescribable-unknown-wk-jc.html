He cannot believe he just left, causing so much chaos in their household. He travels on a journey to The Forbidden and back, chasing after empty promises of stability until he discovers a higher being that gives you anything for so little in return. His older brother searches for clues, facts, beingsanything to find the missing brother. He finally finds him, but he cannot process the thought of him being used and treated like a dog.

In the meantime, the mysterious stranger fights through his own personal battles, but as time grows little, he struggles to keep his fear under control. He knows his contract won&#39;t last forever, and when it expires, he knows his master will sell him back to the one person he fears most . . ." />
