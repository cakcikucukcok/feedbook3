  <title>Heaven in a Mirror - Jonathan Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alexi is an elderly woman, lying in a hospital bed on Christmas Eve, 2085, nearing the end of her life. As her pain medication causes her to drift, she thinks back to the true love she has never forgotten, even though those memories are more than seventy years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, Alexi is eighteen, and although she doesnt know it, this Christmas will bring magic. She discovers she is able to walk through her mirror into another world, where she travels to a placed called Azure City and meets a young man named Ethan. She learns that this is, in fact, a gateway to paradise--a place for people to encounter their soul mates before moving on to heaven. Alexi spends seven days with Ethan--visiting a water park, flying in a hot air balloon, riding a dog sled pulled by rabbits, and so much more. She also finds that living a good life on earth will bring her soul back to paradise after death--to spend eternity with her soul mate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fantasy novel, a young woman visits a spiritual realm at the age of eighteen and discovers that she has a soul mate waiting for her in heaven.&lt;/p&gt;" />
