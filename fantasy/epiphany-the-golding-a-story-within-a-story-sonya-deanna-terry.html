  <title>Epiphany - THE GOLDING: A story within a story - Sonya Deanna Terry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;Sophisticated and thought-provoking&lt;br /&gt; ... an urban fairy tale for grown ups.&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Avid Ashley&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;-- GOLD MEDAL Winner in the 2016 Global Ebook Awards USA&lt;br /&gt; -- RED RIBBON Winner in the 2015 Wishing Shelf Awards UK&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;A mystical forest ... A forgotten history ... A love that spans lifetimes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; First in the two-book &lt;em&gt;Epiphany &lt;/em&gt;series and a captivating blend of history, mystery, contemporary romance and magic, &lt;em&gt;THE GOLDING&lt;/em&gt; is a story-within-a-story, a whimsical tale about money and its unknown otherworldly origins.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Rosetta Melki (part-time tarot reader, struggling sole parent and full-time idealist) begins a reading group to examine a fantasy novel, and discovers the book to be anything but fiction.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; The book, written in the 1770s by Edward Lillibridge, is a hidden history that reveals the true beginnings of the global monetary system. Lillibridge&amp;rsquo;s story surrounds ancients from a gold-obsessed empire and the sprites they oppress: elfin clan dwellers whose currency of choice is kindness.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Whether discontent in rich and poor will ever make way for a world free of war and poverty, whether anyone can believe enough in humanity&amp;rsquo;s true ancient history to activate the dawn of a benevolent new era, remains to be seen. One thing, however, is certain. A prophecy must be fulfilled by someone in modern times, and the time-crossing sprites of Lillibridge&amp;rsquo;s descriptions have set their sights on Rosetta. But first they must ensure she meets her one true love. Feet-on-the-ground finance executive Matthew Weissler is hardly a likely candidate -- even less so after their klutzy introduction. He&amp;rsquo;s polished, successful, admired, and ... is disturbed to find he&amp;rsquo;s being followed by an elf.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;****Includes detailed Character List&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Awards:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; GOLD MEDAL - 2016 Global Ebook Awards USA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (Spiritual/Metaphysical Fiction)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;RED RIBBON - 2015 Wishing Shelf Awards UK&lt;/strong&gt;|&lt;br /&gt; (Books for Adults - Fiction)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5-STAR SEALS (x4) - 2015 Readers&amp;#39; Favorite USA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (Fantasy)&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What readers are saying on international sites ...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ...
