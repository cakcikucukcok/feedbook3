  <title>One with Bird - Douglas K German</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1938 out on a farm three hundred miles west of Omaha as Ruby puts her love for her husband, Aksel, on the line to stand with their son, Carsten, who Aksel has rejected as a sissy. Then three barefoot urchins lulling away a 1950s summer day down by the railroad tracks get caught up with a sex predator in a most unusual and humorous way.
Over ensuing years, Douglas Germans stories move from the town cop, Biggie Budd, who shares his wisdom with twelve-year-old Frank Viig, who is devastated by the drunkenness of the wealthy father he adores, to 2017 where Calhoun, a neo-Nazi, is holed up in the hills. Along the way, Maria, a peasant living in a mud hut high in the Colombian Andes Mountains, humbles a lawyer from a blue-stocking firm in Omaha, and a young man ponders a poignant childhood memory of the day his father showed him how to respect Walkie Talkie, a survivor of the Bataan Death March.
One with Bird shares seven unique stories that provide a glimpse into the humor, tragedies, and unique events that accompany living out on the Nebraska prairie. In 2017 the author was awarded recognition by Glimmer Train Press for South of 18, one of the seven stories." />
