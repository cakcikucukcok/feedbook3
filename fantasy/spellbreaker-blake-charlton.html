  <title>Spellbreaker - Blake Charlton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Leandra Weal has a bad habit of getting herself in dangerous situations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While  hunting neodemons in her role as Warden of Ixos, Leandra obtains a  prophetic spell that provides a glimpse one day into her future. She  discovers that she is doomed to murder someone she loves, soon, but not  who. That&#39;s a pretty big problem for a woman who has a shark god for a  lover, a hostile empress for an aunt, a rogue misspelling wizard for a  father, and a mother who--especially when arguing with her daughter--can  be a real dragon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leandra&#39;s quest to unravel the mystery of the  murder-she-will-commit becomes more urgent when her chronic disease  flares up and the Ixonian Archipelago is plagued by natural disasters,  demon worshiping cults, and fierce political infighting. Everywhere she  turns, Leandra finds herself amid intrigue and conflict. It seems her  bad habit for getting into dangerous situations is turning into a full  blown addiction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As chaos spreads across Ixos, Leandra and her  troubled family must race to uncover the shocking truth about a  prophesied demonic invasion, human language, and their own  identities--if they don&#39;t kill each other first.&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Spellbreaker&lt;/i&gt; is the long awaited sequel to Blake Charlton&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Spellbound&lt;/i&gt;, which was listed by Kirkus Reviews among the Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2011. This final installment of the &lt;i&gt;Spellwright Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;  stands alone as a complete story; however, fans of the series will find  in it answers to the questions raised by the previous books about  Leandra&#39;s parents, Nicodemus Weal and Francesca DeVega.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
