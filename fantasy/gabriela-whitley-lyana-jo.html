  <title>Gabriela Whitley - Lyana Jo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Gabriela Whitleys life as a college senior is both ordinary and enviable. Blessed with beauty, brains, good friends, and a handsome, athletic boyfriend who adores her, Gabriela is looking toward a future filled with success and happiness. She has no idea that she is being watched by someone who longs for herthat is, until she hears a strange, distinctively seductive voice in her head one evening while searching the local bookstore for another great book about vampires. She is terrified and runs into the night, but finds herself inexplicably drawn to the handsome and mysterious stranger, whose name is Maddox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unable to resist the lure of Maddox and his world of vampires, Gabriela learns that he knows even more about her than she knows herself, such as her true past and the circumstances around her mothers death years earlier. She discovers that she is no ordinary young woman but heir to the throne in a place that she thought existed only in dreams. But danger lurks there, too. For instance, Maddox tells her of his sister, Madisonbut who is Madison really, and how far will she go to get what she wants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As more and more is revealed, Gabriela is torn between fulfilling her destiny and returning to her perfect life, which is spiraling out of control. In a story both romantic and unnerving, every choice has consequencesand no one is immune to temptation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
