      <meta name="description" content="Everyone knows the story of how in the beginning, the Lord created heaven, earth, and angels; however, there are other unknown beings among us. When God created the world, he used different elements. And since he is so busy, he created spirits and gave each an element. When the spirits have children with mortals, they create children that are called Elements. There is another being called Unnaturals, the children of demons and humans. God, the devil, Elements, and Unnaturals have all been at war for ages; however, there is one Element that was born with the power to change the tide of the war. This is a story of a child, Palem, being kidnapped by an Unnatural to be taken to the devil, and a mother, Jade, a fire Element, on a mission to save her son from being brought to the depths of hell." />
