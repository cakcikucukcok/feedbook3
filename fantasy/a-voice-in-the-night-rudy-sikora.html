  <title>A Voice in the Night - Rudy Sikora</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story about romance at different levels, at different times and with different people making life the essence of good and evil. They are not aware of what they are doing because romance takes up all the time in loves expectations. The young are eager to experience love which has two different connotations. When you view Agape Love on the one hand and Erotic Love on the other you will notice a difference.  Here we will examine the very essence of love and try to give an explanation of what love does when two people are truly in love.  There is also a court case included that involves lesbians. Mac Dominick is suing Mystique Kalama for trying to take his wife Hachita and destroying his marriage.
 Ms. Kalama claims a love affair with Hachita. It should not be viewed as a secret. Love is connected with time, and time has its limitations in human life. However, there is also tantric that is discussed and used to help you in the understanding of getting on the same wavelength. The characters are using tantric love to get closer together and experience the difference of origin for man and women.
 You will be exposed to a brilliant conversation to their states of mind, their grudges, resentments, frustrations, hopes and ambitions.  All this will end when they recognize that life is change and when it stops it ends." />
