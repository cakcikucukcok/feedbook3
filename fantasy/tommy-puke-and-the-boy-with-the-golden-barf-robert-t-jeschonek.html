  <title>Tommy Puke and the Boy with the Golden Barf - Robert T. Jeschonek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who&amp;#39;s the grossest kid in the world? Tommy Puke, that&amp;#39;s who! He fights off bullies with his mighty loogies...conquers jerks with his powerful farts...and sticks up for his pet skunk by driving off wild dogs with his blistering bad breath. What happens when he takes his new friend, Josh, on an epic quest to find the fabled prince of vomit, who might just be Tommy&amp;#39;s brother? Action, laughs, and more disgusting gross-outs than you can shake a booger at! Will Tommy and Josh find the prince, otherwise known as the Boy with the Golden Barf? Will his golden barf make them rich? Will he welcome Tommy Puke to the family? Or will Tommy and Josh find themselves in over their heads in the sewer in a deadly battle with the only person more stomach-turning than Tommy? One thing is for sure: the puke, boogers, loogies, poop, and goop will fly! And Josh must gain the power of the secret Eighth Emanation&amp;mdash;a magic bodily fluid far grosser than any known to mankind&amp;mdash;to stand a chance of surviving. Don&amp;#39;t miss this hilarious and action-packed gross-out adventure from award-winner Robert Jeschonek, author of the young readers&amp;#39; fantasy My Favorite Band Does Not Exist, named a Top Ten First Novel for Youth by Booklist magazine." />
