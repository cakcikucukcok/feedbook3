At just eighteen winters, she ranks the most elite fighting force in all Kadoor. Taking her field promotion when her father was forced Past the Veil afore her eyes, she and her LifeBond partner and lifemate, Gunnarr the Mighty Blue, High Prince of the Highland Dragons, lead her Warriors to victory against the Hoard in the Battle for the Dragon Clan, the most horrific since the Last Holocaust.
