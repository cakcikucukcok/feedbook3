      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Emily lives in the quiet village of Oak Haven with her Mum, Dad and her lovely dog, Toby. Her life is a happy and peaceful one, but there is more to Emily than meets the eye. The young girl has a very strong connection with animals, one that becomes even more apparent when she enters the wood that lies just outside the village. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Strange things happen in the wood, and Emily isn&amp;rsquo;t convinced whether the wood has magical powers, or even if she herself has special abilities. Whatever the reason, life is never quite the same when she is there.&lt;br /&gt; Emily&amp;rsquo;s problems really begin when she discovers that goblins have come to her precious wood. They are making the woodland creatures&amp;rsquo; lives a misery, and seem intent on staying.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not if Emily can help it...&lt;/p&gt;" />
