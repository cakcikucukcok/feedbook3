  <title>Sayyida - Jo Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the year 1485, a daughter is born to Muslim parents who fled to Morocco as the conquering armies of Ferdinand and Isabella advanced through Andalusia. The baby is promised as wife to her father&#39;s friend, also a nobleman from Spain. Unlike her brother, Zuhra is destined to grow up mostly inside the walls of the family kasbah in Chaouen, a secluded village high in the Rif Mountains, governed by her father, a descendant of Prophet Muhammed. Indulged and free from care, her childhood is confined and protected.&lt;p&gt;
When she marries at sixteen, Zuhra&#39;s world swiftly expands to include Berbers, Jews, sultans, pirates, Christian captives, and an unpredictable family. With an independent spirit and persistent curiosity, her life as a traditional Muslim woman moves from duty and devotion to fame and notoriety, then romance and adventure. &lt;p&gt;
Sayyida Zuhra al-Hurra, called both Renaissance woman and Pirate Queen, rules a city-state for a quarter century at a time of turbulent historical shiftsthe dominance of Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean, Spanish and Portuguese invasions of North Africa, New World voyages, and the Ottoman Empire&#39;s advance toward Europe. Facing loss and betrayal, Zuhra meets the challenges of a wider world with resilience and audacity." />
