  <title>The Secret of Bridd - M. D. Millar, Floyd Ryan Yamyamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom of Bridd is about to be invaded by a ruthless Emperor who wants to enslave all peoples in his path. He wants to become the most powerful man in the world and for that he needs the Foursome. The King of Bridd knows how to defeat him and gathers the people who can help, but everything comes with a price: if they fight him, their lives will be changed forever. On the other hand, if they stand by and do nothing, everybody will fall under his domination. Will the King be able to get everything, and everybody, ready for the crucial moment? With help on the way and his peoples loyalty, Good could defeat Evil, but time is short. Follow the story of the people of Bridd and watch how loyalty and sacrifice can change Destiny." />
