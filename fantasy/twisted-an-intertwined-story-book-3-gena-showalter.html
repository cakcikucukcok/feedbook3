  <title>Twisted (An Intertwined Story, Book 3) - Gena Showalter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Sixteen-year-old Aden Stone has had a hell of a week.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;s been: Tortured by angry witches. Hypnotized by a vengeful fairy. Spied on by the most powerful vampire in existence. And, oh, yeah, killed—twice. His vampire girlfriend might have brought him back to life, but he&#39;s never felt more out of control. There&#39;s a darkness within him, something taking over. . . changing him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Worse, because he was meant to die, death now stalks him at every turn. Any day could be his last. Once upon a time, the three souls trapped inside his head could have helped him. He could have protected himself. But as the darkness grows stronger, the souls grow weaker—just like his girlfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The more vampire Aden becomes, the more human Victoria becomes, until everything they know and love is threatened. Life couldn&#39;t get any worse. Could it?&lt;/p&gt;
