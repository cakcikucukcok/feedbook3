  <title>Tales of Prophet Idris (?????? ?????) Bilingual Edition English &amp; Russian - Muhammad Vandestra, Мухаммад Вандестра </title>
      <meta name="description" content="Prophet Idris (Enoch) is an ancient prophet and patriarch mentioned in the Qur&amp;#39;an, whom Muslims believe was the second prophet after Adam. Islamic tradition has unanimously identified Idris with the biblical Enoch, although many Muslim scholars of the classical and medieval periods also held that Idris and Hermes Trismegistus were the same person.He is described in the Qur&amp;#39;an as &amp;quot;trustworthy&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;patient&amp;quot; and the Qur&amp;#39;an also says that he was &amp;quot;exalted to a high station&amp;quot;, Because of this and other parallels, traditionally Idris has been identified with the Biblical Enoch, and Islamic tradition usually places Idris in the early Generations of Adam, and considers him one of the oldest prophets mentioned in the Qur&amp;#39;an, placing him between Adam and Noah. Idris&amp;#39; unique status inspired many future traditions and stories surrounding him in Islamic lore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
According to hadith, narrated by Malik ibn Anas and found in Sahih Muslim, it is said that on Muhammad&amp;#39;s Night Journey, he encountered Idris in the fourth heaven. The traditions that have developed around the figure of Idris have given him the scope of a prophet as well as a philosopher and mystic, and many later Muslim mystics, or Sufis, including Ruzbihan Baqli and Ibn Arabi, also mentioned having encountered Idris in their spiritual visions.Idris&amp;#39;s father was Yarid and his mother was Barkanah. Idris&amp;#39;s wife was a woman named Aadanah. Idris also had a son whose name was Methuselah; who would eventually be the grandfather of Prophet Nuh (Noah). This means that Idris was the great-grandfather of Noah.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Idris was born in Babylon, a city in present-day Iraq. Before he received the Revelation, he followed the rules revealed to Prophet Seth, the son of Adam. When Idris grew older, Allah bestowed Prophethood on him. During his lifetime all the people were Muslim; no one associated partners with Allah. Afterwards, Idris left his hometown of Babylon because a great number of his people committed many sins even after he told them not to do so. Some of the Muslims left with Idris. It was hard for them to leave their home.They asked Prophet Idris: &amp;quot;If we leave Babylon, where will we find a place like it?&amp;quot; Prophet Idris said: &amp;quot;If we immigrate for the sake of Allah, He will provide for us.&amp;quot; So the people went with Prophet Idris and they reached the land of Egypt. They saw the Nile River. Idris stood at its bank and mentioned Allah, the Exalted, by saying: &amp;quot;Subhanallah.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
