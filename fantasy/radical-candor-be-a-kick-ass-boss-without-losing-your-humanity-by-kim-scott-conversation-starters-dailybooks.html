  <title>Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity by Kim Scott | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Radical Candor: Be a Kick-Ass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity&amp;nbsp;by Kim Scott | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Entrepreneur Kim Scott is the author of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestselling book Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity. In this book, she shares how people with the best intentions can become bad bosses. They can make the people around them and under them miserable. In the process, they restrain the growth and genius of their people. Their people complain of instability and high production costs. On the other hand, great bosses have personal relationships with their employees. Scott shares the three principles on how this relationship plays out. She demonstrates these principles through stories, anecdotes and mistakes that she committed herself. She says that no matter what the size of your company and no matter how bad your boss can be, these three principles can make you a great boss yourself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Former Google SVP Business Operations Shona Brown praises Scott for &amp;ldquo;[bottling] some of Google&amp;rsquo;s magic and shared it with the world.&amp;rdquo; New York Times bestselling author Daniel Pink says that Radical Candor is a must-read &amp;ldquo;if you manage people?whether it be 1 person or a 1,000.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
