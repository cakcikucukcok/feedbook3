  <title>Well of Sins - Bonnie King, Richard King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BOOK DESCRIPTION
All civilizations have a story or myth of an Armageddon, a great war where good and evil will clash, fighting for the fate of the Universe.  Some say good will triumph, others say not.  
In the time of Troy, three god-forged items were crafted.  None of the gods who made these artifacts knew of the vital role each will play in that battle until history has molded them to its own needs.
From Troy through Moses and to the Emperors of Rome, these items have been influenced by the sins and virtues of those who held them, and in return they have influenced their holders.  From one hand to another they have been passed, through the generations.  Only centuries after their making will their final purpose be known.
No one truly knows when Armageddon is supposed to begin, but many believe it is right around the corner.  They may very well be right.  A time approaches where these artifacts will be sought; whether for good or evil remains to be seen.  But to understand what these items are, it must be told how they came to be.  
From Troy to Egypt and the Promised Land, the Cup of Apollo becomes the prize of a young man with a slingshot. A young man who would one day become King." />
