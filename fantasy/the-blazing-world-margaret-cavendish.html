  <title>The Blazing World - Margaret Cavendish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1666, the same year that Newton graduated Cambridge, Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, wrote &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;A Description of A New World, Called the Blazing-World&lt;/i&gt;&amp;quot;, better known as &amp;quot;The Blazing World&amp;quot;. An early work of science fiction, this short novel touches on alchemy, the occult, religion and philosophy, moving between topics &amp;mdash; and accuracy, in the light of modern understanding &amp;mdash; at a dizzying pace. Like her contemporary Newton&amp;rsquo;s writings, which ranged from physics to alchemy, Cavendish&amp;rsquo;s work showed the transition in thought from ancient philosophy to modern ideas that was the hallmark of the scientific revolution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;quot;The Blazing World&amp;quot;, a woman from our world is kidnapped by a suitor on a boat, his plan goes awry, the boat&amp;rsquo;s crew dies, and the woman is transported to another world as she rounds the Earth&amp;rsquo;s pole. The world she is transported to is the eponymous and fantastical Blazing World. There she becomes empress of the Blazing World through marriage. The core plot unfolds in a space scarcely larger than its summary. The empress and Cavendish herself later interact, mediated by spirits. The women become fast friends, platonic lovers, and travel to each other&amp;rsquo;s worlds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Blazing World&amp;quot; is a feminist work. It was written by a female author in the 17th century under her own name, to an audience of women, about women characters discussing topics of natural philosophy in a fantastical setting. The work is subversive, exploring Platonic love in scenes which feature without judgement homosexuality, androgyny and polyamory.&lt;br /&gt;
