We first met Alexis in Between Worlds, when she went to the faery realm to get her best friend, Molly, back. She goes on a long harrowing journey that not only changes Alexis but cemented her in the faery world.<br /><b><i>Divided Worlds (Faery Realm, #2) by Jennifer Ridge</i></b> | So much so that it’s spilling into both worlds. The faery realm itself was seemingly divided from the start into two original courts, that further evolved and are now five. Except it’s actually five plus a band of cast-offs referred to as “The Solitary.”<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Divided Worlds - Jennifer Ridge</a> </h3></p><hr/>
