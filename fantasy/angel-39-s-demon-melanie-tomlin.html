  <title>Angel&#39;s Demon - Melanie Tomlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Protect Little Mother, when the time comes ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Satan&amp;#39;s archdemon, Asmodeus, is jealous of the relationship the earth-bound angel, Helena, has with his lord and master. He has devised a plan that will rid them of the harlot for good, one that requires stealth, loyalty and a sacrificial lamb.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gina&amp;#39;s children are awakening, only to find that someone is methodically torturing and murdering anyone who has met her. The self-proclaimed angel followers seek out Helena, who they&amp;#39;re supposed to protect, each of them wondering what an immortal could possibly need protection from. They believe that in the end it is she who will protect them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Helena learns of what&amp;#39;s going on in the world around her, she tries to save as many lives as she can. Yet to stop the carnage she must come face-to-face with another earth-bound angel and defeat him &amp;mdash; or die." />
