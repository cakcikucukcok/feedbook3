  <title>The February 23Rd Coup - Chaitram Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="both an edge-of-your-seat page-turner and a profound commentary on Third World politics at their most elemental level. &lt;b&gt;Scott Douglas Gerber&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;i&gt;The Law Clerk &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Ivory Tower&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Captain Stephen Erickson is sent to Guyana, where he runs into West Point pal Andrew Rambarran. A government overthrow is imminent, but will Steves dedication to his old friend cause trouble? &lt;p&gt;
Guyana, South America, 1979, was not a free and easy place to be. The Kabaka Party ruled the government and the streets. They carried swagger sticks, wore heavy leather boots, and called each other comrade. They had promised to make the small man into a real man; instead they brought poverty, starvation, and racial mistrust to a nation once hopeful, but now disgruntled. &lt;p&gt;
American Captain Stephen Erikson accepts his post as Assistant Military Attach in Guyana, aware that a military coup might be in the offing. Hes happy to reconnect with his old West Point pal, Captain Andrew Rambarran, serving in the Guyanese army. While rekindling his friendship with Andrew, Steve meets Anita, Andrews cousin. She is beautiful and intelligent, and Steve cant help but fall for her. &lt;p&gt;
Steves loyalties become severely tested when the military plan to take down the Kabaka Party moves the country into a state of uproar. Should Steve be true to his friend, Andrew, or to his countrys interests in the affair? More importantly, will either he or Andrew live to find out?" />
