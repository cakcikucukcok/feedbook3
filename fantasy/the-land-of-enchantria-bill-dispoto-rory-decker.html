  <title>The Land of Enchantria - Bill Dispoto, Rory Decker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the land of Enchantria, there is an ancient prophecy handed down by the imperial wizard eons ago and passed down from generation to generation.
The prophecy states that, during an age of darkness in a year of a constant moon, to a mortal woman who is queen and a mortal man who is king will be born an enchanted boy child. This child, himself destined one day to be king, will have the power to bring light to all creatures great and small. He will right the wrongs done in the name of evil, he will restore the land to its earthly form, and he will forever drive the darkness from the hearts and souls of all beings.
Six beings, all born on the same day but to different lives, have their futures inexplicably and inexorably connected to serve the prophecy. Two princesses, one the golden-haired daughter of a good king and queen, and the other the raven-haired daughter of a witch-queen bent on revenge and power. Two half-bloods, both exiled from the tribes of their parents, find each other and form a lifetime bond of friendship and alliance, pledging to protect the child princess. And, finally, two mortal enemies born in the deepest reaches of the dark forest, one half-animal/half-man with only death and suffering in its heart, and the other a member of the gifted tribe, whose abilities will mean the balance of power between the powers of light and darkness.
As they grow, their lives are all set upon the same pathto locate and obtain a magical device of unspeakable power, the diamond scepter. It is said that the scepter can make a weak enchanter strong and make a strong enchanter invincible, but legend has it that the scepter also controls the mythical Iron Army, an undefeatable army of indestructible soldiers. Both sides want the scepterthe agents of the light want it returned to its rightful place in the Crystal City, but the agents of the darkness want its power to destroy the light and rule of Enchantria." />
