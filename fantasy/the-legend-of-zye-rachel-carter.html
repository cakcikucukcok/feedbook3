  <title>The Legend of Zye - Rachel Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When your destiny is laid out for you from birth, it should be easy to fit into it. But that isnt always the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the planet of X48, everyone is born knowing their name and future, and deviating from that plan is unheard of. It sounds easy, but sixteen-year-old Zye isnt so sure. Since birth, hes been slated to become a soldier, but hed much rather be a healer instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After he graduates from high school, he receives orders to report as a soldier and travel to planet Silver. Here he will train to become a fierce warrior. But when he hears his older, war-hero brother speaking about an upcoming fight against a group of powerful magicians called the Draes, Zye uncovers a secret that will change everything hes ever known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, old powers left forgotten have begun to gain new strength, and Zye learns things about himself, his brother, and his planet he had never imagined. The young man who believed for so long that he was just one of millions now might be his planets only hope. Yet it is the tragic murder of Zyes beloved older brother that spins his life out of control, and Zyes future may, for the first time, be irrevocably altered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
