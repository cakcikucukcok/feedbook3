  <title>The Enforcer - Abigail Owen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Death comes for everyone. Even Drake Chandali. The aging process that twists all unmated dragon shifters&#39; bodies into something useless has taken hold of his body centuries early. A mate could have reversed the process, but now it&#39;s too late. To protect his team of enforcers, he leaves, and comes face to face with the woman he&#39;d thought was human when he saved her from a fire months before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except she&#39;s not human. She&#39;s a mate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Camilla Carrillo almost lost her family to wildfire. To discover she&#39;s fated to mate a creature made of flame and rage, and become one herself, should be terrifying. But somehow a rightness settles inside her, especially when she&#39;s around the glowering red dragon shifter who wants nothing to do with her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Drake learns Cami bears his mark--the same mark as the High King--he refuses to believe she&#39;s meant to be his. It&#39;s too late. How could he turn Cami only to take her with him to the grave? At the same time, he can&#39;t walk away. Hiding her from the corrupt, rotting High King might be the last honorable thing Drake ever does with the little time he has left.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Fire&#39;s Edge series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The Mate (prequel)&lt;br&gt;* The Boss&lt;br&gt;* The Rookie&lt;br&gt;* The Enforcer&lt;/p&gt;" />
