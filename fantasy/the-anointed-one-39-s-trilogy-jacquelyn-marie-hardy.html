      <meta name="description" content="Prophecies fulfilled, three are born to save two worlds. Evil has a name and has learned of the three gifts that will destroy him. Almightys anointed ones must find these gifts or both worlds will be ruled by the Evil One.

The third anointed one, Fin, Prince of Baume, has always felt like a part of him was missing. He must join Tillie to fulfill their destinies. 
Will Tillie embrace her destiny, or will she fight it? Will Tess get to Tillie in time to help her understand why she was meant to do great things?
