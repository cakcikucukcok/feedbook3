Artemis is the the first city ever built outside earth, on the moon. Smart and sassy Jazz lives here but does not like being poor so she accepts a high-stakes job that will make her rich. She only needs to use her skills to help a businessman sabotage a mining operation. But her employer gets murdered and her actions put the entire city in peril as she gets trapped between two dangerous forces. A killer and law enforcers are after her. How can she save herself and her city?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Artemis is the second novel of Andy Weir, author of the bestseller debut novel The Martian on which the blockbuster film was based.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
