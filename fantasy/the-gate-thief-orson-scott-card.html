  <title>The Gate Thief - Orson Scott Card</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this sequel to &lt;i&gt;The Lost Gate&lt;/i&gt;, bestselling author Orson Scott Card continues his fantastic tale of the Mages of Westil who live in exile on Earth in &lt;i&gt;The Gate Thief&lt;/i&gt;, a novel of the Mither Mages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here on Earth, Danny North is still in high school, yet he holds in his heart and mind all the stolen outselves of thirteen centuries of gatemages. The Families still want to kill him if they can&#39;t control him...and they can&#39;t control him. He is far too powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And on Westil, Wad is now nearly powerless--he lost everything to Danny in their struggle. Even if he can survive the revenge of his enemies, he still must somehow make peace with the Gatemage Daniel North.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For when Danny took that power from Loki, he also took the responsibility for the Great Gates. And when he comes face-to-face with the mages who call themselves Bel and Ishtoreth, he will come to understand just why Loki closed the gates all those centuries ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Mithermages series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Lost Gate&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Gate Thief&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Gatefather&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
