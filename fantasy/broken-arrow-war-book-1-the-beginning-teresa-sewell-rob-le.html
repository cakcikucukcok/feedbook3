  <title>Broken Arrow War: Book 1 The Beginning - Teresa Sewell, Rob LE</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a mystical world where lycans and vampires rule, where magic, cruelty, and blood are part of everyday life, where if Good fails, the world is lost, the fate of the world rests in the hands of three people. These three are believed to be those from a long-forgotten legend of a race thought to have been destroyed long ago. But were they all destroyed, or just hidden from those out to kill them?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Brenat and Teera believe they&amp;#39;ll never have children. So when a miracle happens during their bonding on the night of the Blood Moon, they are both extremely happy. They dream of raising their new family in their small hidden valley.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But others want the baby for their own evil plans. The wicked witch Keres and her master want to destroy all good, and they believe Brenat, Teera, and their son Joel are the ones spoken of in the ancient legend of creation. Keres and her master believe that if they can gain control of Joel and convert him to evil, they will rule the world. And they are not the only ones with such nefarious plans for Joel...&lt;/p&gt;" />
