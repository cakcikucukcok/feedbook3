&lt;br /&gt;
Trump&amp;#39;s political detractors have attempted to sabotage him during the 2016 presidential campaign. Former secret service agent Dan Bongino says that each of the players had their own motivations that led to the creation of a &amp;quot;false narrative that almost caused Donald Trump to lose the election and continues to hound him in his presidency.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
British intelligence played a part in helping the Democrats to nail down Trump. Ukrainians played a part in promoting the view that the Russians and Trump colluded. The Clinton Foundation has connections with foreigners who spread the news about the Trump-Russia collusion. The book enumerates and identifies the major players in the operation.&lt;br /&gt;
Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump is authored by Bongino who wrote the bestselling books Life Inside the Bubble and Protecting the President.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
