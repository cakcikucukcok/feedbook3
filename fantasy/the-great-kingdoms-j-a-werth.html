      <meta name="description" content="~THE FIRST BOOK OF A NEW AND ENCHANTING SERIES~
King Edward and Queen Maria always wanted to have a family, but they could not conceive normally. With the help of a wizard and a forbidden spell, Princess Hayden was born. One look at their baby and they knew they finally had the child they had dreamed of
However, not everything happened according to plan. Her father and mother knew there would be consequences, but there are some things you just cant expect. They were able to hide most of Haydens problems by keeping her away from people and secluding her to the castle.
As time passed, Hayden had grown into a young lady searching for her place in the world. But after being confined to the castle for most of her childhood, Hayden grew tired of not having any friends. She started sneaking outside of the kingdom and dreamed of what was beyond its walls. One foggy night she meets two new friends, Collin and Edwin. The only problem is that they were the princes from the other two kingdoms that her father was feuding with.
Finally Haydens 16th birthday is just around the corner as she starts to fall in love with one of the princes. However, everything is about to change for Hayden. What will her beloved think when she finally decides to tell him about her magical past? Will he still love her?
With the help of her new friends, Hayden decides to take matters into her own hands to find the wizard. But in the world of magic, anything can happen. Dangers lay around every corner, and a battle wages against dark magic to save the kids and their kingdoms. Can these three kingdoms overcome their past to save the ones they love?
For in the world of magic &amp; The Great Kingdoms, anything can happen!" />
