  <title>Time Was - Steve Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Annabelle Donohoe, the CEO of World Tech, is mad as hell. &lt;p&gt; Her dreams of world domination died the day Zac Robillard discovered her evil plans and fled World Tech, taking his greatest creation, his beloved I-Bots, and all his research, with him. (Read about their origins in &lt;em&gt;Isaac Asimov&#39;s History of I-Bots!)&lt;/em&gt; More than super-machines, more than robots, the I-Bots are eerilyhuman in appearance, but not in abilities. Their genetic components--based on human DNA--and mechanical infrastructures give them pshyical strength and powers humans can only imagine, and a measure of free will impossible in robots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annabelle wants them back and will stop at nothing to get her way, including hiring the world&#39;s deadliest assassin to find Zac, and his I-Bots--the beautiful &lt;em&gt;Radiant&lt;/em&gt; and Killaine, clever &lt;em&gt;Itazura, Psy-4,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Stonewall&lt;/em&gt;--and bring them in...or kill them. For if Annabelle cannot have the I-Bots she vows that no one else can either. But Janus, the ruthless killer, is not the only hunter they must elude...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surrounded by enemies, Zac and the I-Bots can find no safe place, not even the streets. In the year 2013, the Silver  Metal Stompers, a neo-Nazi gang, roam the nation&#39;s cities wreaking havoc on robots, especially Scrappers, outmoded homeless robots who huddle in hobo camps, rusting away unless they are repaired by a mysterious humanitarian and robotarian called DocScrap. In an unlucky twist of fate, the Stompers discover DocScrap is none other than Zac Robillard and that the I-Bots aren&#39;t exactly human...and vow to crush Zac and the I-Bots into wreckage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on an original concept by Isaac Asimov, &lt;em&gt;Time Was&lt;/em&gt; is a nonstop action adventure combining all the excitement of Golden Age SF with the technological wonders of modern cybernetics and quantum science. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This remarkable collaboration between the greatest science fiction genius of all time and a team of brilliant young writers is a major publishing event. Only the Grand Master himself could have foreseen the awesome wonders depicted in &lt;em&gt;Isaac Asimov&#39;s I-Bots.&lt;/em&gt; And only today&#39;s finest storytellers could have brought them so vividly to life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
