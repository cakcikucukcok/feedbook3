  <title>Definitely Deadly - A.C. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a quiet night on the town, Dev Xander and Kaz Shade suddenly find themselves surrounded by a flock of vampires. Mistaking the two men for humans and easy prey, the vampires move in for the kill. But the vampires have made a deadly mistake. Dev and Kaz arent human; they are Deadliesthe Seven Deadly SinsEnforcers who execute the supernatural bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dev and Kaz deal with the vampires in typical Enforcer fashion. But killing Snake, the leader, is only the beginning. A sovereign vampire controls this merry little band of bloodsuckers, and the Enforcers must determine who it is and execute him before the human death toll rises too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During their search, the Enforcers perform a few executions, rescue a few gnomes, and still find time to fall in love. Half-daemon, half-human, and all trouble, Dev struggles with his strong attraction to Maia Severn, a werewolf who is their liaison with all things gruesome. Two women from another Enforcers past reappear, and they both have designs on him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;c&gt;NO ONE SAID THIS MISSION WAS GOING TO BE EASY.&lt;/c&gt;" />
