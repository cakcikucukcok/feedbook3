  <title>Powers - Brian Michael Bendis, Neil Kleid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ever since she could walk, Homicide Detective Deena Pilgrim followed in her father&#39;s footsteps. A man with a badge, Waldo Pilgrim surrounded himself with what Deena believed to be the cream of the crop when it came to serving and protecting. These days, Deena won&#39;t discuss her father or the life she left behind in Atlanta years ago, a life before she partnered with Christian Walker to investigate homicide cases in a city where perps and victims boast incredible, dangerous powers. Now, nearly a decade of bringing Powers to justice has broken down Deena&#39;s resolve, along with the walls she erected long ago to protect herself from prying eyes. Walls that kept her from a past best left alone, and from those determined to get close and bring horrible, heartbreaking memories to the surface once more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a cold case reopens a series of unsolved murders that point back to Deena&#39;s family tree, she is unavoidably reacquainted with a former boyfriend with ties to both sets of killings, along with her sordid past. Forced to question the choices, decisions, and steps she&#39;s taken in life, love, and career---including her long-standing partnership with Walker, a former Power whose secret history intersects with Deena&#39;s own---Detective Deena Pilgrim must bring a killer to justice and, in doing so, hopefully come to terms with the kind of cop she wants to be . . . assuming that she wants to continue being a cop at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written by &lt;i&gt;Powers&lt;/i&gt; cocreator Brian Michael Bendis and novelist Neil Kleid, &lt;i&gt;The Secret History of Deena Pilgrim&lt;/i&gt; is the first-ever prose story set in the world of the award-winning, critically acclaimed comic book series by Bendis and artist Michael Avon Oeming. &lt;i&gt;Powers&lt;/i&gt; tells the stories of human police officers attempting to solve crimes in a world inhabited by superheroes and supervillains. In January 2015, the Playstation Network debuted it as its first-ever hour-long scripted programming, featuring characters and plots from the comic book series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
