  <title>Daughter of Skye - Thérèse Pilon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Theres a war coming and its not her waror is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thrust into the Realm of the Other, Leah finds herself in a world shadowed by darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The clans of the two-legged have forgotten who they are, while the clans of the four-legged watch, unwilling to intercede in a battle they do not consider theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the darkness rises, Leah discovers that the journey between has changed her. No longer fearing what she cannot see, she embraces the whole of it, her spirit-self rising, her vision enabling her to communicate in the old way with the clans of the earth above and beneath. 
Realizing that the Other wants what she carries within her, she undertakes a perilous journey. Guided by the Unseen, an ancient entity who has always beenprotected by Chera, a silver-eyed wolf and a handsome warrior known as The Hunter, they are aided by the Mukwa: one of the old ones, from the time of the dreaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Leah journeys into the forbidden places she prepares for a battle where light and dark meet and only one of them will walk away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name, translated by the people was The Hunter. Born to the clan of the two-legged, he ascended by the order of his birth to become leader. The unexpected arrival of the woman had startled him, but it was her courage that impressed him; that, and what he saw layered beneathhis own memories stirring as he reached out.&lt;/p&gt;
