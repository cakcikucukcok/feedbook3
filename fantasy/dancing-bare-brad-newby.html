  <title>Dancing Bare - Brad Newby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At a young age, Sandy Lewis and Mark Matthews were gifted with psychic powers. Together, they now form a team of covert government operatives that can easily infiltrate any crime ring. As their abilities have developed, they have become further and further immersed as in their roles as agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their newest case takes them to the world of a Colombian drug cartel. Their job is to get close to the syndicates don, discover his secrets, and bring him down. Sandy will pose as a go-go dancer in a gentlemans club frequented by the don; Mark, operating as a DEA agent, will go undercover to keep Sandy safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, however, they realize they might be in over their heads. The true nature of the don shocks them. They are no longer battling drugs; it appears they are facing an international terrorist attack. Sandy and Mark are the only people with the knowledge and psychic skills to stop the horrific destruction that has been planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this the sequel to The Bee Charmer, a young couple pursuing criminals using their mind bending psychic powers become immersed in the danger of international terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
