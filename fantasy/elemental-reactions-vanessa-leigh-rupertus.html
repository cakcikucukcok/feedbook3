  <title>Elemental Reactions - Vanessa Leigh Rupertus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fifteen-year old Rai Solane is an Element Fire. Her people control where the sun shines and where the fires break out. She&#39;s also an Undesirable, someone who looks different than the norm. That label has made it difficult for Rai to make friends. It&#39;s also given her an overwhelming desire to prove that even though she looks different, she can accomplish something good.   Her life takes an unexpected turn on a day she&#39;s relaxing and watching historical movies at her retreat, a home away from home. She meets two elements, the likes of which she&#39;s not seen before. Jason Riverstone is an Ocean, and Ray Fauna is an Earth. From that moment, Rai&#39;s existence spirals into a series of complications that include being pursued by the Queen of the Sea and an evil company.   During her adventure, Rai learns about herself and her world, including the other beings who inhabit it." />
