  <title>Ukeria: the Prophecy of Cypher - Mr. Uker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A centuries old prophecy is about to be fulfilled and the only one that doesnt know about it, is the one man that has everything to do with it, CYPHER.
In Ukeria, a land segregated by species and hate, an ancient prophecy has begun. Cypher emerges in a land that he doesnt recognize.  He doesnt know who he is or where he came from.  He meets an imp named Waljan who promises to take him back to his human village only to turn him over to the Groenuho tribe.   While in captivity, he learns of the prophecy and the fear that he strikes amongst the people across the land, for he is the one that will destroy their world.  After escaping death and the Groenuho, he meets other creatures that are willing to do whatever it takes to stop him from fulfilling the prophecy.  Confused and lost he continues to find help from a select few of creatures, while trying to find his purpose in the land of Ukeria.  In a struggle to escape death and avoid his part in the prophecy, Cypher turns out to be more than what the creatures of Ukeria could ever imagine." />
