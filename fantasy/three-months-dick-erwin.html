  <title>Three Months - Dick Erwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Demetrius wakes up one morning and has a craving for a mouth watering cheeseburger. He decides to call in sick from work and go on an adventure that is 415 miles long. The drive starts out just like any other road trip, but after stopping for gas, this all changes. Just over 190 miles into his adventure, he makes a decision that will forever change his life. Demetrius stops to help someone who is stranded on the side of the road on a very cold morning. The person in need turns out to be a beautiful young woman who is having car issues, while running away from her own problems at home. From this moment on, their lives will be changed dramatically. Demetrius tries to convince the young lady, that he has fallen for, to join him on his adventure. Since her car will be in the shop for the next few days for repairs, she agrees to join him. Their adventure encounters many twists and turns. They must battle the weather, muggers, dragons, a wild polar bear, and participate in a battle to save a kingdom under attack.&lt;/p&gt;" />
