&lt;br /&gt;
Should we lock people out of the middle class, or should we lock people out of the country? Reihan Salam criticizes immigration advocates who welcome millions of immigrants with low-level skills who will never be able to reach middle-class status because of their lack of skills. These advocates are the ones who are &amp;quot;in a position to employ vast numbers of low-wage helpers, who could do menial jobs more cheaply and reliably than machines...&amp;quot; This, according to Salam, will only lead to even greater inequality among social classes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We don&amp;#39;t want to live in an America with an underclass that is forever locked out of middle-class prosperity,&amp;quot; he says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Melting Pot or Civil War is cited by a New York Times review as a book that will change the conversation about immigration. It is written by Salam who is Executive Editor of National Review and co-author of Grand New Party: How Conservatives Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
