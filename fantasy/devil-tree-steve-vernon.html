What Some Folks Are Saying About Steve Vernon&amp;#39;s DEVIL TREE!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A mesmerizing journey into unimaginable darkness, DEVIL TREE showcases Steve Vernon at the height of his power, and results in a provocative, profoundly unsettling novel you will never forget.&amp;quot; - Greg F. Gifune, author of THE BLEEDING SEASON&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;DEVIL TREE is a frightening tale of man versus nature in every meaning. Vernon has written a tale of murder, infidelity, death and depravity. Full of horror and darkness - a supernatural tale like no other.&amp;quot; - DARK RIVER PRESS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you are looking for a story that will scare you, DEVIL TREE is a great read.&amp;quot; - SIZZLING HOT BOOK REVIEWS&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A well-written story that will appeal to fans of both the grotesque and magical realism. You must have a tough stomach to be able to handle this tale - OPINIONS OF A WOLF&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;With Cronenberg-esque body terror, a Wendigo-type sub plot, and a wicked tree that would give the vegetation in the original EVIL DEAD a run for its money, DEVIL TREE is a best bet for horror fans tired of not being scared by horror fiction.&amp;quot; - THE HORROR FICTION REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This genre needs new blood and Steve Vernon is quite a transfusion.&amp;quot; - Edward Lee&lt;br /&gt;
