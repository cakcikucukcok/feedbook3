      <meta name="description" content="Following on from the Invasion and then Hildar Civil War this book takes you to the little valley of Corfia where only one family is left that wields the old magic.  Problem is the two who wield it, a wizard and his daughter, are possibly the stupidest people in Berlien.
Unknown to them and their family a Yowie, Moggio and his companions need them to use their magic to fix a little problem they have with Death personified and his offsider Pestilence, a very annoyed gunya.
Getting the assistance of a wizard who is powerful and stupid was always going to be tricky but when the Braille gunya Snog sticks his nose in things go very wrong.  But all Snog wanted to do was return home.  Having a daughter who knew she was a man trapped in a womans body was just another thing he didnt need." />
