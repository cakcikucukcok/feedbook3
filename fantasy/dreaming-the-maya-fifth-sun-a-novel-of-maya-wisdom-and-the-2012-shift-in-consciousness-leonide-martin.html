  <title>Dreaming the Maya Fifth Sun:A novel of Maya Wisdom and the 2012 Shift in Consciousness - Leonide Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can dreams be portals to different realities? Could they link the world of ancient Mayas to current times? Two women-a Maya priestess and modern spiritual seeker-are drawn together across centuries by Jana&#39;s recurrent dream. Risking everything she holds dear and putting her marriage in jeopardy, Jana is compelled to journey to jungle-shrouded Maya ruins where she encounters mysterious forces linking her to Maya priestess Yalucha, who was mandated centuries before to hide her people&#39;s mystical knowledge from the Conquistadors, to be revealed at a critical time. Jana&#39;s reluctant husband Robert is swept along into unsettling experiences with his own Maya roots. What secret bond weaves their lives together with the ancient Maya through events during the height of Tikal, Uxmal and Chichen Itza? In the countdown to the Maya calendar ending in 2012, Jana is called to re-enact a ritual at Chichen Itza to revive hidden knowledge. Could her choice to fulfill this ancient Maya prophecy make a difference for the world? Jana must rediscover her own Maya powers to contend with dark shamanic forces bent on preventing her mission-and activates forces that can heal or destroy her deepest love." />
