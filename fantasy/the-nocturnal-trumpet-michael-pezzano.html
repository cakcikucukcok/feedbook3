  <title>The Nocturnal Trumpet - Michael Pezzano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Nocturnal Trumpet&quot; is comprised of fourteen short stories in the horror/fantasy genre. In &quot;Spirits of Evil Past,&quot; you have the wax representations of four notorious historical figures who assume human form after being entered by their original spirits. The emotionally disturbed protagonist in &quot;Flames&quot; commits multiple acts of arson at the behest of a netherworld fire demon. A commercially successful pulp writer becomes the target of his most popular literary character in &quot;The Vengeance of Silverhawk.&quot; &quot;The Dark Heart of Fear&quot; is an unconventional haunted house story in that the house is not haunted by ghosts but by its own sinister will and its need for human fear. &quot;Written in Stone&quot; can almost be described as a dark fairy tale, as a lonely twelve-year-old girl becomes psychically linked with the gargoyles that sit at the top of her church. &quot;Blood Oath&quot; is populated by two rival nocturnal motorcycle gangs who are far more than they seem. These stories and the eight others come from a shadowy world where anything can happenand usually does. They should make the reader the least bit uneasy; they should make them stop, wonder, and look back over their shoulder, for it&#39;s the imagined terrors that are the most terrible and the hardest to dispel." />

"The Dark Heart of Fear" is an unconventional haunted house story in that the house is not haunted by ghosts but by its own sinister will and its need for human fear.
