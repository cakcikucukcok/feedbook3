  <title>Defender - Wesley T. Calaway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing ever goes Raymond Scotts way, and it seems that everything that can go wrong with him does. But he must go oneven though anger often consumes him with such ferocity that he fears a beast is emerging. Raymond must be his own defender.&lt;/p&gt;
With the help of his court-ordered sessions with psychiatrist Dr. Swatlosky, Raymond attempts to dissect all the reasons why he loses control on so many occasionsincluding the most recent incident, in which he assaulted a police officer who pulled him over. Raymonds biggest fear is that he will be committed, so he carefully screens everything he admits to his psychiatrist. But the beast that lives within him is telling him something elseto kill, mutilate, and destroy his adversaries. Now Raymond must decide if Dr. Swatlosky is a friend or foe and whether the drugs prescribed for him are causing more harm than good.&lt;/p&gt;
Raymond knows the whole world is watching his every movelistening, judging, and mocking him. But Raymond has no idea he is about to receive the shock of a lifetime. And no one is left to protect him, but him.&lt;/p&gt;
