      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;Book three of Magic Born&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;em&gt;She was the only Magic Born to ever escape the Rangers. Now there’s a ten-million-dollar bounty for her return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Trancehacker Tuyet Caron could have left New Corinth for good, but instead uses her magic and risks her life on a daily basis to help the Magic Born. She’s been careful to avoid capture, but a careless glance at a video camera brings her face to face with the Ranger who let her go.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Captain Dale Hayes let Tuyet walk away once, but he won’t make that mistake again. When faced with the ultimate choice, however, he chooses her with barely a thought. But that also means siding with the Magic Born and becoming a fugitive in the eyes of the law.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Tuyet and Dale plan to flee, but are caught in a deadly riot that kills innocent people. Outraged, the pair vows to bring an end to the Magic Laws, regardless of what that means for their own safety.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;79,000 words" />
