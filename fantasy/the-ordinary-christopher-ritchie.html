Indeed, with the main theme being the viral spreading of fear via the media in a world where pornography has become commonplace, it&amp;rsquo;s not all that far-fetched for a horror story.&amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;I find the real horror is there for all to see,&amp;rdquo; Ritchie says. &amp;ldquo;The news now compared to five or 10 years ago is really so much more aggressive and depressing. We&amp;rsquo;re fed large helpings of gruesome discovery every day and that&amp;rsquo;s just not good for the mind.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s primarily what The ordinary is about, dressed up in horror-satire as a man takes on a crusade to punish girls who willingly go into porn.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;My story sets up a reality not so unlike ours, where porn is becoming more acceptable and it&amp;rsquo;s driving a really seedy industry where on the fringes we&amp;rsquo;re seeing human trafficking, effectively sex slavery, girls being lost to the world, hooked on hard drugs&amp;hellip; to me that&amp;rsquo;s just so awful and, troublingly, so likely.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Ritchie describes it as a virus and reckons it&amp;rsquo;s spreading worryingly fast. &amp;ldquo;It is! You&amp;rsquo;ve got 10-year-olds with smart phones exchanging this stuff in playgrounds. They&amp;rsquo;re growing up with this mass exposure to what is essentially dehumanising women, making sex something dark rather than enjoyable, and they&amp;rsquo;re indirectly feeding an industry which is purely and simply exploitative. I&amp;rsquo;m fascinated but absolutely disgusted by that world.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; There is some light in the darkness though. The ordinary is an allegory-laden satire, with impressive character development, twists, and a hefty dose of black comedy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
