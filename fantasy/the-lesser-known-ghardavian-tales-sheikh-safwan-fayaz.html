  <title>The Lesser-Known Ghardavian Tales - Sheikh Safwan Fayaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Latifa, a young girl from Kashmir, seeks to discover her inner potential. Her life changes when her bedridden mother gifts her a mysterious present. What secrets lie in this new possession of hers? Will she be able to uncover those secrets?
The Naqash family is like any other middle-class family of Kashmir, until their only son, Ahmed, dies in an accident. Was it really an accident? If not, then who murdered the innocent child?
Buck, a plum-headed parakeet, is cursed by the vicious Marlet Kites who control Marland, a magical forest. Will he be able to break the curse and set himself free in time? Will he be able to bring justice to his fellow creatures of Marland?
The Lesser-Known Ghardavian Tales is an enthralling collection of short stories and poems that celebrate the importance of magic in ones life. The stories very subtly try to remind the readers that anything can happen in this world and that life in itself is a miracle. Ghardavia is the authors childhood imaginary world." />
