And that also means avoiding alcohol and other drugs. And that also means avoiding Wanda Witch and her evil cast of friends, who would love to cause harm to the pumpkins healthy lifestyle. The pumpkins also make a visit to Squashland for their annual golf tournament, and have an adventure in the Amusement park.
