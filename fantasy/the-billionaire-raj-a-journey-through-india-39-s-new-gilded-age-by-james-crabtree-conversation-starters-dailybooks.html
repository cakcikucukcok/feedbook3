      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Billionaire Raj: A Journey Through India&amp;#39;s New Gilded Age by James Crabtree | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author James Crabtree paints a colorful portrait of the rise of the new billionaire class in India despite its radically unequal society. In The Billionaire Raj: A Journey Through India&amp;#39;s New Gilded Age, Crabtree relays the facts about India. It is currently the world&amp;rsquo;s largest democracy. It is the home to more than a billion people. Its economy is expanding in a faster rate than China&amp;rsquo;s. However, the rewards of this great growth have not been shared evenly to its people. The top 1% of India owns almost 60% of the nation&amp;rsquo;s wealth. In Mumbai, half of the population live in slums but a few dynasties enjoy extraordinary riches like America&amp;rsquo;s Rockefellers and Vanderbilts. In The Billionaire Raj, James Crabtree brings the readers on a journey to meet the billionaires, tycoons, and the political power brokers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tunku Varadarajan for The Wall Street Journal writes that Crabtree&amp;rsquo;s book is &amp;ldquo;lively and valuable blend of the empirical and the anecdotal.&amp;rdquo; The Economist says that Crabtree &amp;ldquo;show[s] how India&amp;rsquo;s political system and its firms are symbiotically connected, in an entertaining&amp;mdash;and sometimes disturbing&amp;mdash;fashion.&amp;rdquo; Jonathan A. Knee for The New York Times says that The Billionaire Raj is &amp;ldquo;a nuanced portrait.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
