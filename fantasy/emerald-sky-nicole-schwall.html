  <title>Emerald Sky - Nicole Schwall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Contessa Rose and her siblings are forced to move to a small town in northern Oregon with their grandparents after the premature death of their parents.  There they hope to lead normal lives.  Instead, they come face to face with the supernatural.  Contessa picks up her role as a social outcast, where she meets the secretive Thorne family, and the elusive Elliot.  Contessa is sure that the family is hiding a secret as dark as her own, and she is determined to figure it out.
In a strange twist of fate, Contessa is forced to participate in a school fundraiser by her twin sister.  During her forced participation, she discovers a strange truth about Elliot, and his family, a truth that could possibly mean the end of Contessa if she reveals it.  Never one to run from a challenge, she exposes herself to the dark family.  Now that she is exposed, Contessa is in more danger than ever before.
However, Contessa and the pixie-like Angelique Thorne become friends fast.  Angelique and the other Thorne siblings force Elliot and Contessa together, believing that there is something deeper between them.  Their interference forces Contessa into a world of magic and secrets that she believed only existed in fairytales.  As Contessa heads deeper into a strange and dark relationship, the world around her begins to unfold.  
As her relationship with the Thornes grows stronger, her relationships with her family and friends become more strained.  Her sister and best friend cast her out, and her brother begins to pull further away from both sisters.  With no one else to turn to, Contessa engulfs herself completely into understanding the supernatural that surrounds her.
Unable to step aside, Contessa continues to use her own gift to save everyone around her.  She is soon to find that her luck is running out.  It becomes apparent to Contessa that she needs a little protection of her own when a dark figure from her past comes back to haunt her.  When the monster that killed her parents comes looking for revenge, Contessa is forced to return to her childhood home to save her brother.  In a life or death battle, Contessa is forced to put aside her pride, and let someone else take care of her for once." />
