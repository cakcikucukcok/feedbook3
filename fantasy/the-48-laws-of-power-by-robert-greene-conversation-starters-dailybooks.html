      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The 48 Laws of Power: by Robert Greene | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;ldquo;The 48 Laws of Power&amp;rdquo;, readers are provided with a fascinating and comprehensive summation of the history of power, spanning thousands of years. Drawing from such well-known philosophy and the teachings of those such as Machiavelli and P.T. Barnum, the novel combines each thread with masterful skill and attention. Each &amp;ldquo;law&amp;rdquo; described in the novel is meant to reinforce themes of domination and teach the rules of a dangerous game.&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Greene delivers &amp;ldquo;The 48 Laws of Power&amp;rdquo; with striking and powerful assertions, providing readers with the tools to both crush their opponents and defend themselves from the machinations of other power-seeking individuals. A New York Times bestseller, the novel has remained a hit since its publication and continues to enrapture audiences today.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
