Circling the Sun, the fictional biography of Beryl Markham, showcases life in Africa among the white immigrants, the changing roles for women, and the daring new technological advances made in the world of flying and airplanes. It is also a story about Kenya, horse breeding, and a woman who broke various barriers in her world. Most of all, it is a story about the unrequited love between Beryl Markham and Denys Finch-Hatton, a big game hunter. Love of Africa, horses, flying, and men completes Beryl&amp;rsquo;s life story and is told in a linear tale with a large number of characters from the African Jazz Age.&amp;nbsp;Circling the Sun&amp;nbsp;is a much-acclaimed book that remained on the&amp;nbsp;New York Times Bestseller&amp;nbsp;list for six weeks. It was also nominated for a Goodreads Choice Award and chosen as a book of the month by Reader&amp;rsquo;s Digest.&lt;br /&gt;
