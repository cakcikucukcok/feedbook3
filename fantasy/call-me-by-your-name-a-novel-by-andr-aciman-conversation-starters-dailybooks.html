&lt;br /&gt;
Seventeen-year-old Elio is in love with Oliver, his parents&amp;rsquo; doctoral student guest in their summer villa in Italy. He finds him rather detached and carefree, unlike Elio who spends much of his time introspecting. But he starts getting attracted to him, and all the more as he discovers that Oliver feels the same. Tentative touches lead to passionate sex. But how far will this love affair go? Does the more mature Oliver really love and want Elio to think of something more lasting?&lt;br /&gt;
Call Me By Your Name, a first novel by literary scholar Andre Aciman is the New York Times Notable Book when it came out in 2007. It is recently made into film under the direction of Italian Luca Guadagnino.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
