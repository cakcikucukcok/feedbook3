  <title>Dead Skin - A. J. Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miranda knows nothing of any other life but that of her own of hardship and misery. She knows nothing of the monsters that lurk in the shadows, watching and waiting silently in the darkness to prey on the weak and vunarible. She knows nothing of the life that awaits her, until she comes face to face with one such monster.
Suddenly the life she knew is over and she is cast into an unbelievable and unimaginable world where human lives mean nothing..where she is forced to kill merely to survive.
Brought home to a place she doesn&#39;t know, to live amongst the monsters she never knew existedto become one of those monsters herself.
This new life brings with it a family of sorts, and within that family she is introduced to twin brothers Nathanael and Gabriel.
Miranda soon realises that she has feelings for Gabriel, but he makes it all to clear that he does not reciprocate her feelings, Nathanael on the other hand seems her only ally against the contempt Gabriel shows towards her.
But the brothers roles soon change when Nathanael returns home with some unexpected news, and Gabriel decides he has to tell Miranda the secret he&#39;s been keeping since her arrival at their home." />
