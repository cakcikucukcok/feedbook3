  <title>SYLVIE and BRUNO - A Children&#39;s Fantasy Tale - Lewis Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sylvie and Bruno was first published in 1889 by Lewis Carroll and illustrated by Harry Furniss, same who also illustrated an edition of &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland&amp;rdquo;. This edition has 46 pen and ink illustrations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lady Sylvie is a young Sprite at the beginning of the novel, and later a true Fairy. Sylvie is the princess of Fairyland, daughter of the Warden, and sister of Bruno. While exhibiting very innocent traits, she seems far more mature than her younger brother, and often becomes exasperated with his illogical statements &amp;ndash; just as with most brothers and sisters.&lt;br /&gt;
Just as with &amp;ldquo;Alice&amp;rsquo;s Adventures in Wonderland&amp;rdquo; expect all the elements of fantasy and fantasmagorical beings and creatures for this adventure in fairyland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel has two main plots: one set in the real world, reflecting the time in which the book was published (the Victorian era), the other in the fantasy world of Fairyland. While the latter plot is a fairy tale with many nonsense elements and poems, similar to Carroll&amp;#39;s Alice books, the story set in Victorian Britain is a social novel, with its characters discussing various concepts and aspects of religion, society, and morality.&lt;br /&gt;

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>SYLVIE and BRUNO - A Children&amp;#39;s Fantasy Tale - Lewis Carroll</i></b> | He is perhaps best known for his classics, Alice in Wonderland and Alice Through the Looking Glass. Carroll's fantasy style and use of word play has delighted children and readers of all ages and has influenced many artists. In Sylvie and Bruno two little children meet adventure in such places as Dogland, Outland, and Elfland.<br /><b><i>Sylvie and Bruno: Carroll, Lewis: 9781438536446: Amazon ...</i></b> | Lewis Carroll (1832–98) was the pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, a Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge University. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, Through the Looking Glass, are rich repositories of his sparkling gifts for wordplay, logic, and fantasy.<br /><b><i>Sylvie and Bruno: Carroll, Lewis: 0800759255887: Amazon ...</i></b> | So why is Sylvie and Bruno, a work which took Lewis Carroll many of his later years to write, so little known compared with the two Alice books? Answer: Because it's unreadable. The narrator apparently suffers from catalepsy since he is constantly switching between the 'real' world and an imaginary one.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>SYLVIE and BRUNO - A Children&#39;s Fantasy Tale - Lewis Carroll</a> </h3></p><hr/>
