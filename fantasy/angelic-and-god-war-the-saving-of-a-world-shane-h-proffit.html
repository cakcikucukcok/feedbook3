  <title>Angelic and God War: the Saving of a World - Shane H Proffit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A war happened that was called the Angelic and God War, which was done in the ancient times of the angels and gods. It happened because the evil fallen ones wanted to destroy every last thing in the world and the people who opposed a threat against them. Eventually when they went to battle both the good and evil army had no triumph and all were
dead. Thousands of years later in the sand city of Keyhannatol a master named Zinc, who is an aquamarine god with the power to control water and make huge waves form. He finds out a god Rosepoison and his angels who have powers as well are capturing innocent angels and gods and turning them evil, for they want to start another Angelic and God War that was done in the anicent times. He sends his two trusted angels Sunlare who is a golden angel who can control the suns settings and Moonlore a white angel who can
control the movement of the moon. Sunlare and Moonlore agree and vow to journey to find these beings before something terrible erupts. Along the way they each meet gods Iceloom and Starwise who have powers as well. The both of them will do what they can to stop Rosepoison and his minions, or give their lives if that means death." />
