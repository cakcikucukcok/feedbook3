  <title>We Don&#39;t Own Our Memories Anymore - G. Zik Ofem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We Dont Own Our Memories Anymore, is a fictional journey that chronicles the fate of the memories that Nora, our main character, entrusted to the Internet for safe-keeping. Convinced that the on-line facilities are cheaper, for her storage and access needs, she spends a good part of her young life, digitizing all her memories and family heirloom. After uploading the digitized version, she would discard the live images, believing the digital versions to be real-life replacements and also that, the on-line facilities will always be available to her on demand. Her generation and employer embrace the same beliefs, driven though, by profit motives that masqueraded as the pursuit of efficiency. A cosmic event prevents her and many major corporations from accessing the data and capability they entrusted to on-line facilities they dont own or control. Facing a life without access to her memories, she sets out in search of her memories only to discover that a grand conspiracy now requires that she pay incredibly over-priced charges to regain access to her priced memories. Large global corporations also suffer the same fate; they have also been held hostage by operatives of the on-line facilities that use nuance to exact compensation. Nora finds cause to reflect very deeply, about the interaction between the information she holds dear and priceless, the technologies around that information, and decisions about how she used these technologies in the past. Nora urges cautions." />
