  <title>More Reid&#39;s Short Stories - Alex S. Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I doubt that one person would claim to have written a book without help. I certainly wouldnt. Mary, my wonderful wife of 52 years, along with my family have encouraged me through thick and thin. Friends have helped in many ways. Then there are those Ive met through life whove provided the rich material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked, Where do you get your ideas for a story? I laugh because theyre all around. In my search for an illustrator, I contacted the art teacher at our local High School. One student, Arianna Palmer was thrilled at the opportunity of being published. When I saw her work, I too was excited. Thank you, Arianna, for your wonderful work.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I know Rand Darrow from Books Etc., our Macedon, NY, local writers group. Rand is both author and illustrator of, Witches, Wolves and Water Spirits. He illustrated my story, Purple Man. Thanks Rand.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Paul Bagdon, my mentor, advisor and editor of my stories for sixteen years. Your encouragement has been invaluable. Paul has authored thirty-four books including, Deserter, Bad Medicine and The Busted Thumb Horse Ranch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since a small boy growing up in England, writing short stories has been my passion. They remained hidden away until I retired and enjoyed the time to prepare them for publication. My experiences in Britain and America provided the material for these stories. The incidents, and adventures, both real and imagined are the paint for these, my pictures, illustrating my love of colorful people and of life. Some are funny, some sad, a few are strange, but all are interesting, and reflect life with its many unexpected twists and turns.&lt;/p&gt;" />
