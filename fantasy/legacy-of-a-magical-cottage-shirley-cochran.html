  <title>Legacy of a Magical Cottage - Shirley Cochran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Roberta grew up at a healing center in The United States where natural healing techniques were used.  Some members of her family were able to see fairies, angels and those who had passed over and this made Roberta a little uncomfortable until she had her own experience with a strange little cottage during a time of grief.  She also had a talent for music, which was a source of money as well as great satisfaction throughout her life.  The clinic slowly changed in character and the family finally sold it.  She faced losses and disappointments during her life just as everyone does, but her deep spiritual belief in metaphysical principals and her ability to see the world of elementals, angels and spirits made her life one of magic with wonderful opportunities.  She became entranced with Ireland as a young girl and later moved there after marrying and spent her time writing music, painting and raising her family.  Her brother also moved to Ireland and they spent the years of World War II caring for the wounded in Ireland while she worried about her own husband after his plane went down.  Although he was presumed dead, she knew that he was alive and devoted time each day to helping him survive to come back home.  After the war, she and other members of the family traveled back and forth between Ireland and The United States.  The visits increased after her daughter moved to Arizona and later her brother moved from Ireland and reopened the healing center." />
