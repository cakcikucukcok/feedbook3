      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Winner of the 2018 IPPY silver medal for Best Sci-Fi/Fantasy/Horror E-Book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For thousands of years, Golem Mages ruled the volcanic mountain ranges of Ingleheim, but when Herrscher Heinrich declared himself F&amp;uuml;hrer, he took measures to ensure he would be the last with the power to bend golems to his will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty year later, his regime uncovers the resting place of an Alpha Golem with the power to burn the life force out of anyone caught in its destructive gaze. Katja, a passionate Golem Expert, is tasked to help bring the Alpha under the F&amp;uuml;hrer&amp;rsquo;s control. She is determined to keep it out of his murderous hands and has no choice but to team up with a nameless and faceless soldier, trained in the efficiently ruthless discipline of Steinkamp. A word synonymous with death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair challenge immense power, but their most trying task is learning how to trust in a world where everyone is afraid of you&amp;mdash;or wants to kill you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
