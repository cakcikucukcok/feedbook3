  <title>The Haunting of the Pirates Treasure - Rachel Wolfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Come sail at sea with Dreama Montgomery (a clairvoyant) and her gang as they stumble across a buried treasure from the early 1800s. They opened Pandoras box as they discovered a Ouija board, gold coins, diamonds and emeralds, a pirates gun, old pirates clothing, and a skeleton baby. The treasure haunted them as one of the pirates shot Dreamas dreamsnake lover, Tommy. She had fun seducing each pirate, discovering which one shot him, for his spirit lived deep within her. She tumbled through Tracy City with Murdock, inviting several pirates in her home to form a ship of murderers, where they cook up thirty-two pirates recipes on board the ship. The novel takes a spinning twist when an ole gypsy fortune teller at the state fair reveals the haunting murder of the two Tennessee State Troopers and where the diamonds and emeralds came from. The jewelry haunts them, turning them into mean pirates fighting for their man. The pirates invite you to explore the drama of solving a murder and how to become a pirate in this bewitching tale." />
