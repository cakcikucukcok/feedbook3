Juhg must now unlock the secrets contained in the journals of his now absent mentor Wick, the former Grandmagister and legendary hero known as &quot;The Rover.&quot;  He must also continue his documented but clandestine search for a trilogy of books, which brings him through many different realms of their very dangerous world...and into conflict and contact with other races (elves, dwarves, and men) whose fates are all intertwined among the pages of the great book of Time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Quest for the Trilogy&lt;/i&gt; weaves three separate quests into one as the young historian races against the clock to protect not just his world, but all others as well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
