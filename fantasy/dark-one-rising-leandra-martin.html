  <title>Dark One Rising - Leandra Martin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom of Aelethia has been quiet for five hundred years, but the Dark One is rising from out of the depths. All of Aelethia will perish unless the Chosen One comes forward to save them. Unfortunately, the Chosen One doesn&amp;#39;t know her destiny in the world; she only knows she is odd and confused about where her destiny lies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She wants to find love, but the men in her life that actually love her, she cannot have, and the only one that wants her is as evil as they come. The elves know of her destiny and must tell her and train her in time in order to fulfill the  prophecy that has been laid out before her. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can she become the person they have waited for? Can she, in time, destroy the evil that is threatening to overtake her kingdom? With friends to guide her and a man to whom she truly loves beside her, she may be able to save Aelethia from doom." />
