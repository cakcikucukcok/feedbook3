      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Atlantis: Cherished Gem&quot; is the sequel to &quot;Atlantis: Precious Stone&quot; and is the chronicle of events which occur following the destruction of Atlantis and AurL&#39;s withdrawal of the Projection.  The Atlanteans, who had hoped to regain the Formative World of Yetzirah on board the magical Mnemonotron, regain stunned consciousness to find themselves dwelling within the submerged Lens that they had programmed during the Projection, there discovering that their Magnum Opus for Atlantis is destined to continue upon Assiyatic Terra in the coming epochs.  To the dismay of Lynci, Tym, and their Diamond Classmates, they learn that dissension prevails among the Adepts and Aspirants at the Temple of Avalyn while Satyron and his minions remain evilly active at the Iridium Fountain and elsewhere in the Material World. The loyal Initiates are required therefore to employ their magical skills diligently in the endeavor to manifest AurL&#39;s design for Terra despite intense opposition from his opponents." />
