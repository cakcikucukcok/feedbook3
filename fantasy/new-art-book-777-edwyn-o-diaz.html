  <title>New Art Book 777 - Edwyn O. Diaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once upon a world, somewhere far away in a galaxy not known by humans, existed life forms that had never been seen before.  In this world, exists a race with powers and technology far beyond what humans could dare to contend against.  This race traveled across the galaxy conquering planets.  In time they arrived outside earth to find that it was unlike any of the previously conquered planets, that this planet had previous encounters with their kind.  The ruling race, the Humans, had stopped the scouts from ever reporting their findings.  This time they know of the great resources not held elsewhere that earth holds but so did another race.  This other race came to earth for help since their planet had been conquered but their technology not taken.  With help from this alien race will they be able to stop the oncoming threat from conquering earth." />
