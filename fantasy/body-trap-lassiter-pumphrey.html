  <title>Body Trap - Lassiter, Pumphrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bernie awakens to darkness and thinks hes dead. Theres no other explanation. He cant move or see; hes surrounded by nothingness. Hes dead, right? Yet as he reflects on his life, theres a rather gaping empty space where his death should be. He cant remember the circumstances of his untimely demise, which is when he realizes hes not dead at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hes in a state of coma, but he can hear voices around him. Hes alive, but he cant make contact with the living world. Only then does he again begin to reflect on his lifenot life but lives. His current existence, his current body, is one of many, beginning in the Spanish Inquisition when Bernie was executed for witchcraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touch of magic has followed him throughout his remaining lives. Loved ones are found and lost again, over decades and then centuries. Bernies consistent rebirth is due to his use of witchcraft to mess with preordained destiny. Hes utterly defenseless in his current state, but he must find a way to fight those who mean him harm. Otherwise, this will be his last incarnation, and it will not end well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
