Pamela Koutroulides
As a child, I had bad health and spent 3 years in hospital totally separated from my Mum and Dad.  Visits were few. I retreated into my own world as there was no adult to share with. I learnt to read and read avidly. Sometimes I told stories to other children. I didnt mix with ordinary children until I came out of hospital at 8. I was rather clumsy at it 
When I grew up I became a social worker, wife, mother and grandmother, chesty illnesses following me throughout..  I often spent holidays in a flat in an English castle. It was there that the seeds of this story grew.     
In my fifties,  I journeyed into my imagination and began painting, using pattern and bright colour.  During this time Stephen, the hero of Castle Magic, was born in my imagination.  In my sixties I began writing, slowly discovering my own true voice, and began the greatest adventure of my life.  
Stephens talents, like mine were enhanced by his circumstances, sensitivity revealing the magic and wonder of the world around. There is magic also within and Stephen wants to encourage everyone to find it.
