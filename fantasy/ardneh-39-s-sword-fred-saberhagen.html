  <title>Ardneh&#39;s Sword - Fred Saberhagen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been a thousand years since the time of Ardneh, the transcendant being that saved humanity from the vicious archdemon Orcus. It was a legndary battle between magic and technology that killed them both, but left behind tales of Ardneh&#39;s heroism and newly found hope for humanity. But in the passing years only a few remain that actually believe these legends as truths.&lt;br&gt;Chance Rolfson comes from a long line of Ardneh&#39;s followers, descendants from Rolf, the illustrious warrior who fought in Ardneh&#39;s name for humanity many years ago. A young man plagued with vivid nightmares, Chance hopes to clear his head by joining a forest expedition that seeks physical proof of Ardneh&#39;s existence. Their goal is to discover the great vault prophesized to hold the savior of humanity&#39;s secrets to his own power and wisdom. But the dangers are high in the uncharted forests, rife with bandits and demons that no magic can stop. And as Chance&#39;s dreams become more clear, he soon realizes these are not merely dreams but visions, and he alone holds the key to unlocking Ardneh&#39;s greatest gift, known to the followers as Ardneh&#39;s Sword. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
