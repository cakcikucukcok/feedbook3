  <title>Walking with Wallace - Michael Koe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Walking with Wallace is about a Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the debates he and the Brigadier have (in which, when visiting, his grandson Archie participates), as they walk in the beautiful South Northamptonshire countryside. These debates reflect philosophical and scientific concerns of man and dog, such as their origins and that of the Universe they live in. 
The Brigadier assumes that he can, pretty accurately, interpret Wallaces thoughts. However, Wallace is an intelligent dog and clearly might disagree with some of these interpretations, though perhaps too polite to tell him so.
Since the sad death of his wife, Sara, the Brigadier, until the arrival of Wallace, lived on his own  though not alone, as he has fours sons, four daughter-in-laws and twelve grandchildren, whom he visits as often as possible.
Over the last 13 years, he has, however, seen more of Wallace than any other living creature.
They are both now ageing rapidly, though Wallace perhaps more gracefully. Their time remaining together is sadly
limited, for everyone has an allotted lifespan  though dogs rather shorter than men, so it is likely that Wallace will move on first. If so, the Brigadier will miss him horribly, but if not, who would then look after an old and rather spoilt Staffie? Whichever of them is left behind, will, like everyone else, just have to kick on.
In one of their more controversial debates, the Brigadier asked whether dogs too have souls? And if not, when in the evolutionary process did humans acquire theirs? Will he and Wallace meet again in another life? Wallaces philosophy is simple. The past is the past, live for the present and let the future take care of itself. The story told is largely factual and largely about Wallace, with a clearly identifiable relationship between the Brigadier and the author." />
