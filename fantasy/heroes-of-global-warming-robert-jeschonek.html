  <title>Heroes of Global Warming - Robert Jeschonek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world&amp;#39;s hottest hero has gone rogue! In an age of global warming, super-heated hero Skillet looks like a lukewarm loser. But when his teammates, the Castigators, turn their backs on him, he turns the Castigators into prey. Let the hunt begin! Skillet becomes public enemy number one as he rounds up his former allies. But the secret plan behind his hunt might just save the world. The invention of evil genius Brain Fart could turn back the clock on global warming by melting down the high-powered do-gooders. Can Skillet capture the last of the heroes needed to charge the climate change reverser? Or will an out-for-blood super-hero hit squad cook his goose first? The hope of the future explodes in a fight to the death between the caped-and-cowled warriors of a doomed generation. Don&amp;#39;t miss this action-packed super-hero tale with a difference from Robert Jeschonek, whose work for DC Comics laid the foundation for this thrilling new adventure." />
