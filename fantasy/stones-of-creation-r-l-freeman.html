  <title>Stones of Creation - R. L. Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Long ago, in the high hills outside of a thriving farm community, four young adventurers stumble upon a skeleton against a sloping cavern wall. With few clues to the skeletons identity besides silver and gold coins and a mysterious tablet adorned with four stones, the adventurers, Garik, Kalus, Azure, and Trake, claim the treasure as their own. They create medallion necklaces from the jewels and proclaim their first expedition a smashing success. None of the boys has any idea that this unearthing will lead them on an incredible and dangerous coming-of-age journey.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Years after their discovery, Azure is killed in a battle with an evil mage and Trake is attacked by men who want his medallion. Meanwhile, Kalus escapes a dungeon and Garik reaps the rewards of his talents as a hunter and trapper, oblivious to the fact that someone is willing to do anything to acquire the medallions that still hang around their necks. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; As the three remaining adventurers meet up once again, in a world full of war and mages that quest for ultimate power and never-ending life, they must battle to survive as they attempt to discover the origin of the infamous Stones of Creation.&lt;/P&gt;" />
