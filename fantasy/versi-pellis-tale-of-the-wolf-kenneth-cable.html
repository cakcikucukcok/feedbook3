  <title>Versi Pellis: Tale Of The Wolf - Kenneth Cable</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What frightens you? Not what makes you jump or squeal, but what causes you to be petrified in silent terror, where you cannot move and you fear for your very soul? What makes your blood chill and run cold, freezing you to the bone?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Whatever you name the object of your terror, it fears Charlie McClure. Imagine a creature unlike any other on Earth, the most powerful humanoid on the planet, who cannot be killed by anything known to mankind. A man of high moral fiber who strives to do what is good and right, yet every so often, he must eat. The issue is that he eats people, for the most part. His body will not accept anything else. If he eats something else, his body rejects it and his hunger takes over, attacking and devouring anyone near him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is his story, of how an evil creature can attempt to not be an evil person. This is a story that can change your life. Step inside his world, if your nerve holds up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
