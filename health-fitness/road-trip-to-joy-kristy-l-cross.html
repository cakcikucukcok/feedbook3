  <title>Road Trip to Joy - Kristy L. Cross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arent road trips delicious? The exploration, the exhilaration, the personal discovery, and the transformation that can take place is mind blowing. There is so much to learn by our individual journeys. Our outer world is a reflection of our inner world. We spend a great deal of time decorating our outer world so that it looks a certain way; however, if what is within truly determines our point of attraction and what is showing up in our experience, it only makes sense to dedicate time to looking closely at how our thoughts, patterns, and behaviors have been creating our outer world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Road Trip to Joy is the perfect itinerary for a delicious inner transformation. Within these pages, you can identify and investigate the limiting beliefs that you have been carrying around since childhood. You can learn to forgive those that you have held hostage, thereby freeing yourself. You can learn that you are a deliberate creator in your own life and the steps to take in order to attract the abundance that you desire. Finally, you can learn that the most important place to start this journey is by learning to love and accept yourself exactly as you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for embarking on this spiritual road trip with me.&lt;/p&gt;" />
