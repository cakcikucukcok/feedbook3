  <title>Melancholy, Mania and Miracles - Shelley Thody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mental illness, when untreated, can feel like imprisonment. This book was written to give hope to those suffering from mental illness and more specifically bipolar disorder.  The struggles associated with this condition are not isolated and often create a frightening halo effect that impacts parents and other family members trying to care for a loved one who is suffering. The main purpose of this book is to offer knowledge, insight, and guidance to people and the families who support them by witnessing an intense, frightening, and ultimately joyful journey with bipolar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dont go through hell and back without a good reason, and I recently felt my story needed to be shared.  One binding thread throughout my book is that although the mind is very strong, Gods love and will are much stronger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am now a happy, healthy, married mom with three beautiful children.  I have been an elementary teacher for the last seventeen years and have not required major interventions or hospitalization for twenty-five years.  My story can educate and offer hope to those who are struggling with bipolar disorder and want to re-establish equilibrium in their lives and the lives of those they love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
