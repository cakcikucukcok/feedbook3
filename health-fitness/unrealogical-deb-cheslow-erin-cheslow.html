  <title>Unrealogical - Deb Cheslow, Erin Cheslow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine waking up one day and discovering that you suddenly had the power to create anything you desired in your life. Imagine recreating your entire life so that everything was just perfect: ideal relationships, ideal career, ideal weight, ideal finances, and anything else you wanted. Sound too good to be true? Its not! You already have this power; you just need to learn how to use it. 
In Unrealogical: Real People, Remarkable Stories of Transformation, author Deb Cheslow shares the primary reasons why we settle for the lives we stumble into, rather than purposefully creating the lives we were meant to live, and reveals simple strategies for stepping out of our comfortable, boring existence and forging new paths where there are no limits on what we can accomplish. 
Deb doesnt stop at theory. She offers concrete tools to apply the theoretical information to your life. Then, she includes dozens of stories from clients who have applied this information to their own lives and experienced transformational, remarkable results. Youll discover not only what they did to achieve their aspirations, but also how they did it, and how you can do it too. 
A former United States Air Force instructor pilot, Debs system evolved when she was teaching airmen to fly advanced supersonic jets. She has used this system over the years to transform thousands of lives. It is a system that can be easily duplicated by individuals, teams, organizations, and companies to create phenomenal results." />
