when they feel compelled to do more and be more. Perhaps they have redefined what is meaningful in life and begin investing their time in things that matter.

But theres nothing simple or clich when the description aptly applies to actual individualspeople much like youwho overcame hardships and conquered fears on the way to achieving their vision. Everyone has something significant they want to do in this life, and this book will inspire you to push yourself toward greatness." />
