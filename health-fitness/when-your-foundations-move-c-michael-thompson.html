  <title>When Your Foundations Move - C. Michael Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Change in life is inevitable and often unpredictable. But transitions from one stage of life to another have certain identifiable, predictable patterns that can profoundly affect your life and career. Those transitionsthe times when your foundations moveare often clear only in hindsight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With knowledge and foresight, however, you can see the roadmap in advance of the journey; you can recognize the signs that tell you where you are. You can consciously enable yourself to make a smooth, stable, yet enlivening transition into the next phase of your adult life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;When Your Foundations Move: The Three Crucial Transitions in Life and Career&lt;/i&gt;, author and consultant C. Michael Thompson draws upon established tenets of psychology and adult development to create a guide for recognizing and understanding the patterns of these transitions. Using case studies from his many years as an executive coach and career counselor, Thompson addresses the potential pitfalls and solutions for successfully navigating the three critical transitions common to todays adults, and for building a solid new foundation for your life, work, and relationships. Instead of seeing them only as challenges, Thompson shows how you can use these periods of transition to enhance the success, significance, and satisfaction of the rest of your life and career.&lt;/p&gt;" />
