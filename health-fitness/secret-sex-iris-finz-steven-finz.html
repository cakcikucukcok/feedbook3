  <title>Secret Sex - Iris Finz, Steven Finz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Iris and Steven Finz have an uncanny knack for getting people to talk about the intimate details of their sex lives.  For more than a decade, they have been interviewing people from all segments of society and, with the permission of their subjects, passing the stories along to their readers.  They&#39;ve talked to regular housewives and hard-working husbands, confirmed bachelors, computer techies, nurses, ski instructors -- people from every walk of life -- to find out how they keep their sex lives fresh and exciting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their books about the sexual experiences and fantasies of real people have become standard night-table fare in bedrooms all around the world.  Readers use them not only to add erotic parks to their own relationships, but also to develop a better understanding of the sexual behavior of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Secret Sex: Real People Talk About Outside Relationships They Hide From Their Partners&lt;/i&gt;, the Finzes take an explicit and provocative look at sex outside a committed relationship.  Through various tales of sexual adventures people keep hidden from their significant others, the Finzes reveal how extramarital sex sometimes damages or destroys a relationship, and sometimes helps or even strengthens it.  Working to understand the sexual behavior of the people described in this book will help readers to better understand his or her own sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While we learn the most through observation, the civilized world provides little opportunity to observe others having sex. Consequently, many people form opinions based on the exaggerated worlds of novels and pornography. While these worlds are exciting, forming opinions based on fiction can lead to skewed perceptions of sexual behaviors occurring outside the realm of our own personal experience.  In their unique approach, Iris and Steven Finz provide candid accounts and explicit information, both of which are essential to a true understanding of sexuality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
