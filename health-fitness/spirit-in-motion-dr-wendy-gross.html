  <title>Spirit in Motion - Dr. Wendy Gross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a guide to help tap the energy source within yourself. You will learn to gather and release energy from the deepest recesses of your body and mind. Breathe-stretch creates new room for the tissues that comprise your body, enhancing circulation and allowing deep relaxation. Experience is a gift you give to yourself. Creative use and development of energy can benefit all aspects of your life.
I developed this work because in all my years of physical development (sports, dance, yoga, tai chi chuan, swimming), the understanding of what the instructor indicted when he or she mentioned force or energy remained unclear. It was as though the concept were spoken of or honored but not experience directly or not shared with outsiders.
Breathe-stretch and energy have never been explained simply in such a way as to be made accessible. This text teaches how to produce a greater sense of well-being and how to recreate yourself through consciously directing will and desire. You can learn to experience freedom without bounds by directing energy to expand the deepest recesses of the body, mind, and spirit." />
