  <title>Don&#39;t Be an Average Joe Direction - Joseph Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered why are you here? Have you ever wanted to know so desperately why everyone else seems to understand life, and why you just couldnt seem to get it? It may just seem like everyone else finds their purpose(s), and you cant. Does it sometimes feel like you are trying everything you possibly can, and no matter how perfect a situation, in your life-experience, seems to be, there is always something missing? 
If these questions have ever crossed your mind, this book is for you. This book explains how you can obtain everything you have EVER DESIRED. Better still, it teaches you application and execution of these tools, as well. Applied in everything from your business or personal life- experience, this guide is the first in a series to break ground for self-expansion in a way that you never knew were available to you. For example, picture yourself as you have always desired yourself to be. If you are ready to do whatever it takes to obtain that reality, look no further! This universe is your canvas, this guide is the road map to your Mona Lisa that is your life. As the author I can tell you, the life lessons, experiences, and transformations that ARE taking place inside you, even as you are currently reading this passage, cannot be taught in a textbook. This series IS my life-experience, and how I changed it, to be exactly what I have always DREAMED, and had no idea was truly possible from whence I came! I ASSURE you, I couldnt have been further from the truth! So Ill see you in there!" />
