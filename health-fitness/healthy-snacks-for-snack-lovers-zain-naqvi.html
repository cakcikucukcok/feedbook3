  <title>Healthy Snacks for Snack Lovers - Zain Naqvi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I love snacks. Be it chips, cookies, cakes, popcorn, I enjoy my fair share of them. One of the common misconceptions about eating healthy is that you have to have a lot of time and a lot of money. Thats absolutely not true. All that healthy eating requires is for you to pay attention and take that extra step of looking at the nutrition label and the ingredients of your item and asking yourself if you think that the product is right to put in your body. In this book, what I hope to do is make eating healthy a little easier. First of all, I have presented an alternative to the nutrition label that you will find easier to read. Then I take all the snack foods that you love and evaluate if they are healthy, whether there is too much sugar or salt or high fructose corn syrup. If your favorite munchies arent too good for you, I have provided a list of some healthy alternatives. Enjoy and, hopefully, pick up some healthy eating tips on the way. In this book, I examine the following categories of snacks: cookies, granola bar, crackers, and chips." />
