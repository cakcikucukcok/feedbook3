      <meta name="description" content="Here is where it ends...is about three young girls from the age of 22-25 trying to find a place in life. Rather if it&#39;s for love, happiness, money, or fun. This journey will take you through the walks of life of a single young parent to a daughter, whose mind only strives for love and a family. She is also a counselor for her friends and the one they would always look up to, yet not a good counselor for herself. Then you have a very smart ambitious woman named Jasmine who dates a married man yet has her priorities together from college to a purchased home. Then you have the third girl Becky of the book that&#39;s very clever, street smart, beautiful and a partial single parent to her three kids as the father walks in and out their lives. Throughout the story you will understand the meaning of why women want to love, the effect of watching a friend dying slowly and the determination one can have if they only put their minds into it. You will laugh and you will surely cry at the humor and reality this book will unfold." />
