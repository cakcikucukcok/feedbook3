  <title>Touched by Divine Love - Samantha Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From a young age, Samantha Richards knew things that others didnt, saw things that others couldnt, and said things that others simply couldnt understand. She had the sight, the ability to see beyond and deliver messages. This ability, which some might consider a gift, was the source of great stress and pain for the young woman. After an out-of-body experience in her teens, she stopped the spirits from speaking to her through their usual routes, and life became quieter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2000, at the age of thirty-one, tragedy struck when her first child died during delivery. In her grief and her anger at God, she shut her gifts down for good, vowing never to give another person a message from beyond. She excommunicated herself from the Catholic faith and from God, furious that such a pure, innocent soul had been taken. For nine years, her heart was filled with hatredand then a miracle happened: after her guardian angel healed her heart, Samantha didnt know how to hate anymore. A year later, she witnessed angels protecting her plane. With these invitations, she welcomed the spirits back into her life, with joy and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Touched by Divine Love&lt;/i&gt;, Samantha shares the astonishing details of her path back to her true spiritual self. Now a personal and spiritual development leader, psychic medium, and healer, she hopes that others will see themselves as beings of raw potentialand reach for their true selves in the process.&lt;/p&gt;" />
