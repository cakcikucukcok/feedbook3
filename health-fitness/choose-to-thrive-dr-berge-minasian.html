Since the late 1960s and early 1970s, the so called Vietnam era, we have clearly been on a troublesome path that is anathema to what our founding fathers had in mind for us. Over time we have effectively lost control of our bordersour economy is worse than at any time since the great depressionwe have created an unsustainable and growing entitlement population...half of our children are born out of wedlock. fifty percent of those who do marry eventually divorce. traditional churches are losing their parishionersand our schools have been unfairly maligned.   
Thankfully there is a growing awareness about the dangers we face as a nation if we keep on our present path. Armed with awareness and confidence we can survive this brief hiccup in our evolution. Clearly we are poised to reinvent our national agenda and to create our second Golden Age.  All it takes is for us as ordinary citizens to get involved and take our country back.  Are you ready?
