  <title>Cancer: Second Hand: Being the &quot;Last One Standing&quot; - Lynda R. Baio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will take you along on my journey going through cancer, second hand. It offers insight, tips and inspiration to anyone going through the same, or similar struggles, as well as offering hope. I wrote this book as a tribute to my family of which I&#39;m the &quot;last one standing&quot;. I want to let others know that even though I&#39;m the last one, I am indeed still standing and that speaks volumes. Together, cancer may bend us but never break us. We&#39;re all so much stronger than we know and braver than we even care to admit. Let my book be your guide. Together there is hope, there is strength and there is peace. Together, we can do this and still stand strong. Peace!" />
