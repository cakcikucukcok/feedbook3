  <title>From Graduation to Corporation - Andy Teach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABOUT THE BOOK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I recommend this book as a &#39;must read&#39; for college graduates.&quot; -- Bettie Corbin Tucker-bookreviewers.org&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;em&gt;Human Resources would do itself a favor by presenting each new hire with a copy of this book.&quot;--Edward Halebian, Television Executive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Following the advice in this book at the start of your career will give you a &#39;leg up&#39; on your competition.&quot; -- Scott Braverman, former Merrill Lynch Financial Advisor&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;I would highly recommend this book as a resource to students who want to succeed in their future careers.&quot; -- Stanford University Senior&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t just another book...it&#39;s one of the best handbooks to have when you get into trouble or need ways to improve in many contexts of corporate life.--NVS, Computer Scientist&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Product Description&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second edition (2012) of the popular career advice book, &lt;i&gt;From Graduation To Corporation&lt;/i&gt;, is a comprehensive guide to success in the workplace and is specifically tailored to college students and recent college graduates. It is an invitation to the &quot;Millennials&quot; (Generation Y) to go inside the head of a corporate veteran. By examining the thought processes of a senior executive and learning from his experiences, recent college graduates can be better prepared to narrow the gap between their expectations and the expectations of their supervisors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This edition contains additional information on job search websites, social networking websites, college career centers, career fairs, dining etiquette, and the different generations in the workplace. Other key areas to career success include tips on resumes/cover letters, networking, interviewing, dealing with difficult people, dating at work, how to act in meetings, dress codes, how to stay organized, how to ask for a promotion/raise, Internet/email/telephone etiquette, and Andy&#39;s 73 &quot;Corporate Commandments.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes this book unique is that the author not only gives us his refreshingly honest account of his climb up the corporate ladder, but also discusses his fall from the top rungs. After working for the same two bosses in the same department of a major television and motion picture studio for over twenty years, Andy Teach found himself on the unemployment line. Find out what he did right and what he did wrong so that you can reach the top rungs of the corporate ladder . . . and stay there! &lt;/p&gt;" />
