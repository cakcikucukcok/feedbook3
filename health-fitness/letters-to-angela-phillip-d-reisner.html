  <title>Letters to Angela - Phillip D. Reisner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Letters to Angela provides an intimate glimpse at author Phillip Reisners love for his two daughters, Angela and Kaitlyn. Through a series of emotional letters and honest poetry, Reisner shares the wonderful memories they have shared and the sad, sometimes hurtful events that changed their lives forever. The letters cover a span of nearly eighteen years of Angelas life, including the untimely death of her twin, Kaitlyn, at the age of three and a half. 
Reisner writes candidly about his relationship with his wife, daughters, mother, and extended family. The letters were written during several months of soul searching and emotional venting in hope of finding truth in his relationships. Reflecting on spiritual and earthly forces that affect his life, beliefs, and relationships, Reisners letters are separated by poems, offering windows into the emotions that the author confronts as he explores his innermost thoughts and feelings regarding the events of the lives of those around him.
From the joy of the birth of his twin daughters to the delightful discoveries of their early years to the hope that he and Angela can rebuild their relationship through love and forgiveness, Letters to Angela attests to the unconditional love of a father for his daughter." />
