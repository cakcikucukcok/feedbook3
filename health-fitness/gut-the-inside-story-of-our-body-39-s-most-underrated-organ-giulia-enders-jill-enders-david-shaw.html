  <title>Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body&#39;s Most Underrated Organ - Giulia Enders, Jill Enders, David Shaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Our gut is almost as important to us as our brain and yet we know very little about how it works. &lt;I&gt;Gut: The Inside Story&lt;/I&gt; is an entertaining, informative tour of the digestive system from the moment we raise a tasty morsel to our lips until the moment our body surrenders the remnants to the toilet bowl. No topic is too lowly for the author&amp;#8217;s wonder and admiration, from the careful choreography of breaking wind to the precise internal communication required for a cleansing vomit. Along the way, the author provides practical advice such as the best ways to sit on the toilet to have a comfortable bowel movement, how clean your kitchen should be for optimum gut health, and how different laxatives work. She tells stories of gut bacteria that can lead to obesity, autoimmune diseases, or even suicide, and she discusses the benefits of dietary supplements such as probiotics. This book is a fascinating primer for anyone interested in how our ideas about the gut are changing in the light of cutting-edge scientific research.  In the words of the author, &amp;#147;We live in an era in which we are just beginning to understand just how complex the connections are between us, our food, our pets and the microscopic world in, on, and around us. We are gradually decoding processes that we used to believe were part of our inescapable destiny.&amp;#8221;&lt;/div&gt;" />
