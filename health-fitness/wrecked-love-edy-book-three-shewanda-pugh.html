  <title>Wrecked (Love Edy Book Three) - Shewanda Pugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Edy arrives at Louisiana State University, she soon discovers it takes more than talent to stay in her fellow dancers&amp;rsquo; good graces. Meanwhile, Hassan&amp;rsquo;s status as a newbie freshman means that anytime not practicing is spent steering clear of pranks, cramming every play into his skull, and changing his mind again and again about whether to do that double major. Football, dance, and classes keep him and Edy apart more than together, and in the freedom of a thousand-mile distance from their parents, Edy discovers a wild, free spirit&amp;hellip;one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t sit well with Hassan. But there&amp;rsquo;s a moody, unapologetic bad boy who likes it more than a little. He goes from irritating Edy to intriguing her. Oh, and yes, he&amp;rsquo;s a dancer. Finally, there&amp;rsquo;s Wyatt, in Baton Rouge without an explanation. Freshman year is ricocheting out of control fast as obligations and accusations take their toll. In a world like this, one wrong move is enough for everything Edy and Hassan have worked for to get wrecked.&lt;/p&gt;" />
