  <title>The Last Dance - Julie Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beatrice had finally found people with whom she could spend boring nights. People who needed to get out, socialize, and have fun, just like her! She needed that. She needed kids like her who could teach her how to have a good time in a village that had nothing but woods, deserted streets, and a huge beach.
Beatrice had grown fond of that beach. So close to home, that place could go from a paradise in the daytimewhere one could bathe in the sun, swim, breathe in fresh air, and relaxto a play area at night where one could meet up with friends, express, and experiment.
A gang like the one Beatrice was in would intimidate most, but fortunately for Beatrice, her cousin Claudette was part of it and a very good friend now. Besides, that gang had introduced her to the best part of her life now. This thing was better than world peace; this was sacred, and everyone in her gang was doing it: weed. 
Based on a true story, The Last Dance is about Beatrice Orchard: a teenager trapped in a dysfunctional family searching in her small conventional village back in the late 1960s for a way to forget her problems at home." />
