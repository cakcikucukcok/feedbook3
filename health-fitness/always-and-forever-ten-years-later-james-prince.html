  <title>Always and Forever + Ten Years Later - James Prince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My ultimate goal with my books, including this one is to open people eyes about the biggest scandal of all times, which is religions. Jesus told his apostles that they have received freely and they have to give freely. If you can name me only one religion that does this, please let me know the sooner the better.
           When I read the Bible after many years, I found out that Jesus told us the truth and I also found out that someone else told us the exact opposite of Jesus&#39; teaching. I also know that Jesus is the Christ and who ever or what ever contradicts Jesus is Antichrist.
           If a Jesus&#39; disciple doesn&#39;t tell the truth to the world, who will? I also think that the count down has started in the year 33, when the curtain was split in two at the death of the Saviour and it will end two thousand years later. So it is time that all the nations hear what I have to say. See Matthew 24, 14.&#39;And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.&#39; James Prince, a Jesus&#39; disciple." />
