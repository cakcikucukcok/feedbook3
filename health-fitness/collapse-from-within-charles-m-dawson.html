  <title>Collapse from Within - Charles M. Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The United States is in the midst of collapse. There are many factors contributing to this decline, and most of us dont even realize what they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Collapse from Within, author Charles M. Dawson presents his take on the current state of the nation, sharing a collection of his thoughts and research gathered over the course of his lifetime. He feels Americans have lost their respect for each other, possibly due to the fast pace of life in the current times. Whats more, the country has a severe and increasing debt problem, both nationally and individually. Even so, Dawson has witnessed amazing accomplishments by brave and dedicated people in his lifetime. He holds that the formula for success in life is faith, self-reliance, hard work, perseverance, and responsibility. He believes that anyone maintaining these attributes will become successful at any endeavor they attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This personal reflection presents a call to action for Americans of all ages to understand their history and prepare for their future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
