  <title>Parents, Help Your Child Say No to Drugs - Norman Leibrock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Books are like people, each one has its own story. My book is a story about teenagers with an addiction for drugs and the adverse effects these addictions have on their parents. My hope is that this book will present a picture of the many changes that can present themselves in the lives of young people and parents in their battle with mind-altering drugs. Many parents, unfortunately, are lost in the complexities of our everyday busy lives and their minds are clouded to the problems that are developing before them. Many of us are either oblivious to the problem of drugs or are too afraid to admit to ourselves that we do not know what to do if it happens in our families. Parents are sadly convinced that drug addiction can never happen to their children.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;My wife, Jane, and I had to face that sudden realization that drugs were destroying the life of our son.&lt;/P&gt; 
	&lt;P&gt;I believe that my book, when read in its entirety, will give you the guidance and insight to help all parents and their children to fight drug addiction and to render proper guidance to those already in the grip of mind-altering drugs.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;This book will help to illuminate those hidden changes that drugs can bring into the lives of our children and teenagers, and with it the effects it will have on those around them.
	I hope and pray that the sharing of this valuable information, along with my own experiences, will be a positive force in the thinking of our teenagers and their loving parents.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;My fellow parents, it is of the utmost importance that no matter what happens and how tough it may get, remember there is no other way but up.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;Wherever you are and whatever the problem, dont ever stop the fight against drug addiction.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;I am aware that in the hard-nosed world we live in, there are a multitude of self-help books, and numerous concepts and scientific theories on how to successfully face your problems and bring about changes in your life. But I have written my book for this reason: that parents can be hopeful in a time of adversity, suffering from a family drug addiction problem. Let faith and understanding change your life around.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;As parents, we often read about drugs and the effects they have upon our children. Invariably, our many conversations will drift to the topic of drug addiction and whether our children are in fact using drugs, and what we can do about it. I remember sitting with a group of parents discussing drugs.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;Although we all agreed that the rapid introduction of mind-altering substances was a critical problem to our children, not everyone was in agreement what we should and could do about this problem if it affects our family. Some parents told us our family is very content since all our children are young, this problem doesnt pertain to us at this time. Some parents sat back and told me that their teenage children have never taken drugs. They never had to discuss drugs with their children because they knew they would never touch them.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;A third group of parents were honest enough to admit that their teenage son was a drug addict for years and they didnt know it, and when they found out about it they didnt know what to do about it.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;Parents, do these statements sound familiar? Perhaps something you have heard before but shrugged it off as something you would never have to worry about.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;I realize that this is a sad scenario, but very true. Too many parents are not taking the time to talk to their children and establish a drug-free family when they are young and vulnerable.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;The result has been too many young people becoming drug addicts. Some of them could have been prevented or helped at a young age.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;That initial help must come from us as their parents. We must have a constant sense of awareness of this problem facing our children today.&lt;/P&gt;
	&lt;P&gt;Remember, parents, we cannot change the nature of the drug addict or his addiction, but we can help" />
