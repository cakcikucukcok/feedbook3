  <title>Co-Parenting from the Inside Out - Karen L. Kristjanson, Edward Kruk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Effective co-parenting, or sharing significant parenting time with an ex-spouse, is one of the best gifts separated parents can give to their children.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The interviews in &lt;i&gt;Co-Parenting from the Inside Out&lt;/i&gt; are with real moms and dads in diverse circumstances, showing them making choices, sometimes struggling, and often growing. Their stories offer insights into wise decision-making, as well as practical strategies that strengthen families. Parents see that they are not alone as they navigate their feelings and build a future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
While pain exists in most stories, there is also hope. Co-parents often feel that they have become more confident and compassionate, and parent better than before. The effects of their personal growth and their children’s are the silver lining in the dark pain of divorce.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Karen Kristjanson has brought together real life co-parenting stories that inspire separated parents and help them understand co-parenting better, offering practical tips and tools that directly benefit families." />
