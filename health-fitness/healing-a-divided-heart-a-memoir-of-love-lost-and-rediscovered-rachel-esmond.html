  <title>Healing a Divided Heart: a memoir of love lost and rediscovered - Rachel Esmond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you find your heart divided between what you think you want and what you already have? Do you want out of your responsibilities as a wife and mother?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Polls have shown that ninety-five percent of Christian women admit to having feelings for another man at some point in their marriage. Also, over seventy-five percent of divorces in America are initiated by the wife. This means two things: 1) This is a very real heart problem among even Christian women, and 2) No one in the church is talking about it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is the story of one woman&amp;rsquo;s near destruction by addiction to fantasy. Fantasy addiction is wreaking havoc among women today, and is just as damaging for women as pornography is for men, yet it is far more subtle.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If our souls are enslaved to fantasy, we will never achieve the amazing purpose intended for each one of us. Instead, we will be chronically restless, unhappy and discontented. This book will reveal the chains that slowly ensnare us and explain how to become free, find true happiness, and embrace the life we have as well as our purpose in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Come on a journey to find your freedom!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
