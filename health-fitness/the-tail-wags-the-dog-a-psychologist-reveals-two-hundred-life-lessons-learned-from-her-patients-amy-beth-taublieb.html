  <title>The Tail Wags the Dog: A Psychologist Reveals Two Hundred Life Lessons Learned from Her Patients - Amy Beth Taublieb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the typical self-help books authored by professionals where the clinician attempts to impart his or her wisdom to the reading audience, &amp;ldquo;The Tail Wags the Dog&amp;rdquo; is comprised entirely of lessons learned by the author from her patients. Based on the premise that when done properly, therapy is a reciprocal learning experience, this book shares two hundred life lessons imparted to the author by her patients over a period of almost three decades. Derived entirely from the literally thousands of hours spent interacting in a therapeutic environment with a wide variety of individuals, the book is free from the typical &amp;ldquo;psychobabble&amp;rdquo; and jargon that fills pages and says nothing. Rather, the direct, easy-to-understand language results in a book that has true relevance to each and every one of us. Running the gamut from parenting issues to addictive problems to interpersonal interaction styles to relationship struggles to psychological/psychiatric diagnoses to just plain making it through our day to day life, &amp;ldquo;The Tail Wags the Dog&amp;rdquo; ends up being a virtual guide to living life at an optimal level while navigating its inevitable struggles.&lt;/p&gt;" />
