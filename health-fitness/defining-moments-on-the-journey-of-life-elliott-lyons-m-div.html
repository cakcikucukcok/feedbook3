  <title>&quot;Defining Moments&quot; on the Journey of Life - Elliott Lyons M. Div.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The authors purpose in the writing of this particular literary account of his life was to offer practical and useful tools that will assist others in making wise decisions and beneficial choices in life.
   He draws from his unique personal, as well as professional knowledge and experiences, in the attempt to shed light upon what it truly means to discover ones purpose, plan and meaning in life. The discovery of that plan, provides for us a sense of direction and understanding of how we fit into this vast and complex world. It is revealing for us to be blessed to make such a remarkable discovery.
   This documentary gives a detailed account of how to overcome adversities and reach a level of success. It gives useful advice and offers practical tools to utilize, in order to accurately analyze and assess the best plan of action. The ability to gain a clearer perspective and arrive at workable solutions is never an easy task. 
Vital Information and keys are offered.   Spiritual Keys (Chapter 3)  Financial Management Keys (Chapter 4)  Keys of Enlightenment / Success (Chapter 5)  Successful Marriage / Relationship Keys (Chapter 6)  Pastoral Care Keys (Chapter 7) and  New Insights / Decision Making Keys (Chapter 8). 
   It is the authors prayer, that he will be able to offer helpful tools that will hopefully assist in the decision making process. The goal is to encourage, enlighten, inform and inspire others on their journey of discovery, to move towards a greater sense of self-fulfillment and self-actualization. The revelation of workable solutions and enlightenment about who we truly are; our gifts and abilities, then becomes what is referred to as our purpose and plan in life and our Defining Moment. Everything becomes a little clearer and more meaningful to us when we are able to discover just how we fit into this blessed and great   phenomenon called life. This mystery is made clearer to us and can only culminate in our discovery of God." />
