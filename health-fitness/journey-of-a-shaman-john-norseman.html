  <title>Journey of a Shaman - John Norseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;John Norseman looks back at the incredible journey that led him to become the CEO of four major companies, travel throughout the world, and eventually become a shaman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story begins with his traumatic childhood, which taught him the importance of learning to forgive others and close doors to move forward with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you read his story, youll learn valuable lessons, such as following your heart instead of your head, the importance of walking away from all negativity, and realizing that the only thing stopping you from achieving what you want are the own blocks in your own mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Norseman learned from many spiritual healers, teachers, and guides on his journey, and he overcame abuse, rebuilt self-esteem, turned personal weaknesses into strengths, developed right-brain spiritual awareness, and discovered the meaning of love in its spiritual sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join a shaman on a life-changing journey, and discover how dreams and determination can help you achieve the impossible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
