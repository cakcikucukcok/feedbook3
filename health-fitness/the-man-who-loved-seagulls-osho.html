      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century shares the inspirational insights of timeless philosophies in &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Loved Seagulls: Essential Life Lessons from the World&#39;s Greatest Wisdom Traditions&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Loved Seagulls&lt;/i&gt;, Osho discusses essential stories and parables from the world&#39;s great wisdom traditions of Zen, Taoism, Christianity, and Judaism. Osho--himself a master storyteller--interprets the stories in this collection and applies them to the concerns of modern day life. The valuable lessons they impart are both timely and universal. The stories encourage meditation as they are meant to be told and studied again and again, in order to discover new layers of meaning with each reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideas and topics include:&lt;br&gt;* The futility of chasing happiness&lt;br&gt;* The journey from fear to freedom&lt;br&gt;* The Zen approach to death and dying&lt;br&gt;* The extraordinary intelligence of innocence&lt;br&gt;* And much more&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
