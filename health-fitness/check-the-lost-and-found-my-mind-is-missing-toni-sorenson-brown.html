  <title>Check the Lost and Found, My Mind is Missing - Toni Sorenson Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;SHIRLEY, YOU CAN DO IT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you get when you combine a mother, a wife, and a friend, with a helping of humor, a smidgen of self-help and a dash of dead-on wisdom?  You get Shirley, a woman just like you: looking for answers, trying to stretch the 24-hour-day a little bit longer, and constantly seeking to better herself, even when her &#39;self&#39; is just fine how it is.  Now, in this hilarious, home-hitting new series, you can follow Shirley through the adventure that is daily life-and you just might learn a few things about yourself along the way...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHECK THE LOST AND FOUND, MY MIND IS MISSING!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holiday season is approaching and, despite the endless airing of &lt;i&gt;It&#39;s a Wonderful Life&lt;/i&gt;, Shirley&#39;s life seems anything but wonderful.  As usual, she&#39;s spread herself way too thin-between Christmas shopping, her kids&#39; recitals, her husband&#39;s office party and her work-and she&#39;s feeling thick enough to fill out Santa&#39;s suit.  But a few angels-including those in her very own family-go a long way to remind Shirley what Christmas is all about...and that the best presents are the ones that can&#39;t be wrapped.&lt;/p&gt;" />
