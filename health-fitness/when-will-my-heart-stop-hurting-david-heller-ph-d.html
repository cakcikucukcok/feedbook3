  <title>When Will My Heart Stop Hurting? - David Heller Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Will My Heart Stop Hurting? is a healing and inspirational book about divorce intended to help a parent recover themselves and be as responsive as possible to his or her children during and after the upheaval of divorce. Brimming with pragmatic and sagacious advice about all aspects of the divorce experience, this easy-to-read compendium will help guide the reader to a more peaceful place with regard to divorce and enhance their ability to facilitate healing and growth in their children.
When Will My Heart Stop Hurting? addresses particularly difficult topics around marital dissolution, custody, and subsequent changes in family life. Among the subjects this thoughtful and helpful book concentrates on are the following: the nature of divorce, difficult dilemmas in divorce, what it means to work together with your ex-spouse (even when it isnt easy), what you can do emotionally and psychologically for your child, and finding spiritual understanding in the aftermath of divorce. 
Here are a few sample selections:
A child ordinarily feels that his or her world is turned upside down in divorce. The heroic challenge for you as a parent is to help the world seem right side up again.
With every loss, there is a gain and new things of value are discovered. Teach your child that this paradox is even true of divorce.
Inspire your son or daughter to think of family as a feeling inside of them, not merely a living situation." />
