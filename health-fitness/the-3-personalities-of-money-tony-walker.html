  <title>The 3 Personalities of Money - Tony Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Theres an old saying in the Financial World, the one who makes the rules, gets the gold.
For years, the Financial World has successfully lived by this rule. Biased charts, irrelevant historical graphs, goofy catch-phrases and unreliable risk-tolerance questionnaires, their game plan is to convince you that they know more about you and your money than you do, all the while, making money on your money whether you do or not.
Its a game you cannot win!
The 3 Personalities of Money puts an end to the madness by changing the rules. Instead of allowing the Financial World to control your money by controlling your mind, you will learn the secret of controlling your money by knowing your mind; a concept seasoned advisor Tony Walker refers to as mind over money. Thanks to this breakthrough concept by one of the countrys most contrarian advisors, consumers now have an escape route from the traditional one-size-fits-all mantra pitched by the financial world.
Whether youre confused as to which investments to select in your 401(k) plan or wondering if you should follow the herd into the latest gold rush, The 3 Personalities of Money will give you the answers you need. This book, coupled with the free 3-minute financial personality test located at 3Personalities.com and the unique, real-life stories located at the end of the book, will turn the tables on the Financial world by giving you more confidence in who you are and what fits your financial personality." />
