  <title>Letters from My Father - Suzanne L. Holko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As unresolved issues carried from one generation to the next, author Suzanne L. Holko tried to make sense of her familys situation. She began rereading the letters her father, Walter, had written to her while she was attending college forty years earlier. She also began searching for her fathers ancestors, connecting her with newfound relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Letters from My Father, Holko tells how the intertwining of these events led to a story of understanding, acceptance, forgiveness, and unconditional love. She shares how comprehending the details of her fathers life and what unfolded within her search gave light to the generational wounds unintentionally handed down through her fathers ancestors. She also reveals how she gained further awareness to the challenges faced within her own life and the obvious parallels within both her fathers lifeand the grandfather she never knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Letters from My Father describes Holkos spiritual journey, the healing that occurred, and the blessings that were gained. She received a renewed understanding of all in Gods timing and the joy found within acceptance and unconditional love.&lt;br /&gt;
