  <title>Fearless Faith - Priscilla R. Haley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Faith and fear cannot exist together. In Hebrews 11:11 Faith is described as being &amp;ldquo;certain of what we do not see.&amp;rdquo; It is an absolute belief that God is constantly working behind the scenes in every area of our lives, even when there is no tangible evidence to support that fact. If we are called by God to be women who embody the love of God, then we will have times when our very identity will be challenged. These stories are about ten amazing women, who at various times in their lives faced insurmountable odds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In very different ways, each woman&amp;rsquo;s story will take you on a journey from fear to Fearless Faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Knowing what it feels like to be on the edge of a faith crisis, and at any moment your faith is going to fail you and overtake you, these women stood firm in their faith. What do you do when fear has crippled your heart? They understood that their oppositions were simply the wind that would propel them into their storms. The catalyst, if you will, that launched them into a greater spiritual battle. A battle stronger than any they would ever encounter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fearless Faith - when open to these stories they won&amp;rsquo;t just teach us, they will indeed do something in us. They will inspire us&amp;mdash;they will call us to be the women that God has called us to be, but more importantly, these stories will call us to totally trust and depend on God fearlessly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
