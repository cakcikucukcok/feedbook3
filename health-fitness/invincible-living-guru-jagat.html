  <title>Invincible Living - Guru Jagat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From acclaimed yoga teacher Guru Jagat comes a wildly cool, practical, and beautifully illustrated guide to applying the simple and super-effective technology of Kundalini Yoga and Meditation to everyday life, upgrading your &quot;operating system&quot; inside and out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Invincible Living&lt;/em&gt;, Guru Jagat shares a radical way of understanding yoga&amp;#8212;not just as something to do in practice, but as a broader principle for living. Candid, encouraging, and irreverent, Guru Jagat shows how Kundalini Yoga&amp;#8212;which forgoes complex poses for energy-boosting, breath-driven exercises, quick meditations, and simple poses most of which you can do at your desk&amp;#8212;can reset your life and well-being, regardless of your age or background.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Designed explicitly for everyday people, not ashram-going or gym-bodied yogis, fast, effective Kundalini techniques can be done anywhere, from the car to the conference room. There&amp;#8217;s no need to have a bendy back or toned arms. You don&amp;#8217;t even need a mat: just a quiet space to clear your head, and as little as a minute out of your day. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From beauty and self-care to work and relationships, &lt;em&gt;Invincible Living&lt;/em&gt; tackles both the mind&amp;#8212;from mood elevation and stress reduction to renewed mental clarity&amp;#8212;and the body&amp;#8212;from anti-aging, and increased metabolism to amped up energy. Packed with tips, exercises, and step-by-step instructions and fully photographed and illustrated in Guru Jagat&amp;#8217;s fresh, handmade-meets-hipster style, &lt;em&gt;Invincible Living&lt;/em&gt; is fresh take on ancient wisdom: a must-have guide for anyone who wants simple, effective, tools for a supercharged life as taught by a uniquely compelling teacher who upends all preconceptions about yoga.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Invincible Living&lt;/em&gt; includes 100 color photographs and illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
