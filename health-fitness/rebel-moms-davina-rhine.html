  <title>Rebel Moms - Davina Rhine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Modern motherhood has changed; it isnt just frilly aprons, mini-vans, and soccer practice anymore. You are a modern moma rebel momready to raise your kids while running a successful business, starting a band, or finding your voice, while doing the things you love and fighting for what&#39;s right. Even so, the path to epic mom rebellion is not always easy.
Meet the women who have seen, conquered, and survivedmaking a difference, doing things their own way and on their own terms. They are activists, teachers, veterans, firefighters, pin-ups, fast food workers, tattoo artists, and more. A rebel mom has no set definition beyond her tendency to elude definition. These women, from varying places and backgrounds, have seen it all: divorce, abuse, depression, and disability. They have succeeded and raised children with tough grins on their faces.
Are you a new or expecting mother? Are you a mother who&#39;s fed up with the super-mom/super-woman myth? Or are you a pro whos been there and done that, but would still love to learn from other rebel moms? Its never too late to learn a new trick, and motherhood is never the same for anyone. Cultures change, as do child-rearing practices, but certain aspects of being a mom are universal and timelesslove, support, and strength. The rebel moms have mastered the art of motherhood, and you can embrace the revolution." />
