  <title>Feel Good and Watch What Happens - Anthea Morphitis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;quot;Say Bye to the past life of what you don&amp;#39;t want and say Hi to your newfound life of what you do want.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; This is the take-home message of this self-help, semi-biography by Anthea Morphitis. In it, she explains how having a positive outlook on life actually generates positive events, through the Law of Attraction. Anthea takes the reader through the events of her own life, including a disrupted childhood, two unmarried pregnancies, abusive partners and several bouts of homelessness, and explains how her negative viewpoint-her anger, resentment and fear-drew these negative consequences to her life. It was only when she embraced a positive outlook that her life turned around, leaving her in a Now filled with much success and happiness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Anthea attributes this diametric change to the Law of Attraction, where the human brain is capable of sending out its own vibrational energy that can interact with the energy that makes up the physical universe. She teaches how to change one&amp;#39;s vibrational energy to a positive form through positive thinking and thereby attract positive results. Her own story is living proof that the process really works.&lt;/p&gt;" />
