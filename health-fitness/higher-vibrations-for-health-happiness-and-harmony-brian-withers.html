  <title>Higher Vibrations for Health, Happiness, and Harmony - Brian Withers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Higher Vibrations for Health, Happiness, and Harmony shows you why your life is the way it is, the good, the bad, and the ugly, and how to take back your power so you can take charge of what happens in your life. What we must realize is that much of our influences in our growing years were unaware of some critical pieces of knowledge about who we are as a complete human being and the power we possess to direct and navigate our life.  In the absence of these missing pieces of knowledge, we as a human race have taken on many faulty and limited beliefs about ourselves, and about the way life is to be lived.  This has profoundly affected the quality of our life.  The missing pieces of knowledge not only connect us with our true power as a human being, but they connect us with the fundamental laws that govern everything in the universe, and empower us to co-create the life of our desires. Without this knowledge, not only is it virtually impossible for any of us to live a complete life of balance and fulfillment, but collectively, we cannot achieve world harmony and peace because we are operating with faulty and limited beliefs. In this book you will find the truth of your power and the natural laws, and how to use those to not only live the life you came to this planet for, but to strongly influence world peace and harmony without lifting a finger. You have that much power within you; you simply need to learn how to use it intentionally." />
