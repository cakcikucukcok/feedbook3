  <title>A Moral Disease - Delno Jones, Drew Laine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As you journey through these pages, if you have ever struggled with addiction in any capacity either as an addict or through a relationship, you will know that the author has walked in your shoes.  This is a sincerely personal and honest sharing of the addicts world with the readers journey consistently benefiting from scriptural support.&lt;br /&gt;
Tom Caldwell, PhD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is one of the most valuable books written on recovery.  It was not birthed in a clinic by a team of doctors.  This is a compilation straight from the heart of a former addict who has experienced the personal struggles of the fight to freedom.  After reading this book, every addict and those close to an addict can know that victory is possible.  As a personal devotional or as a guideline for group study, this book will help you secure hope for a bright and better future.&lt;br /&gt;
Robert, a former addict loved by Jesus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this book only useful to addicts?  I definitely doubt that.  We all fall short of the glory of God.  We need to be humble and repentant.  To different degrees and in different ways, we all struggle.  This is good reading for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
