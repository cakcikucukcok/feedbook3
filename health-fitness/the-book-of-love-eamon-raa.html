  <title>The Book of Love - Eamon Raa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The words of Eamon Raa are designed to help those who seek answers. Within us, around us, and above us, many questions are asked, but few are answered. Eamon Raa has answered many questions. He has tried to help those around him with their thoughts and challenges since he was very very young. That innocence still exists to this day. It is still in his eyes and has been conveyed by his words in this book. His answers are thus true and just. They are true to him; they are filled with a hope that is contagious but incredibly empowering. Read this book with an open mind, and it will open your heart. It will help heal your pain. It will help answer some of your questions and help you overcome certain obstacles that may afflict you now or in the future." />
