  <title>What Really Matters? - Anita Torabi PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this short yet fascinating book, you will read about everything that is important or even critical to us turns out to be less and less important over time. We do not know what really matters in our lives.
One day, we are happy; by the next, we are sad or worried. When we are in a specific time, place, and condition, we think that certain issues are important and critical and assign them a value.
You alone have the right to choose the best path to a peaceful and enjoyable life. You can be in any kind of position or have any level of income and be happy regardless of what goes around you.
If you have never given yourself time to think about your life and what you are doing, this is the right time to do so. This is the particular time that you can ask yourself if you are on the path that leads you to where you want to be and whether you are enjoying your life. Ask yourself if you have a forgotten passion that is burning inside you, a love for anything in this world that can take you to a higher level of energy and eagerness. Find your passion today, and decide to live a meaningful life that is free of fear." />
