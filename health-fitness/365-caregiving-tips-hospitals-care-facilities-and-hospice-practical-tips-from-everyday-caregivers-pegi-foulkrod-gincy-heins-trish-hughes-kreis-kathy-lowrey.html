  <title>365 Caregiving Tips: Hospitals, Care Facilities and Hospice, Practical Tips from Everyday Caregivers - Pegi Foulkrod, Gincy Heins, Trish Hughes Kreis, Kathy Lowrey...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are a variety of situations caregivers tackle and all five of the authors have dealt with our share.  One of the reasons we became so close is because we were helping one another through all kinds of caregiving situations.   Some of the most important tips we shared with one another involved hospital stays, care facilities and hospice.  Many caregivers face these same situations so it was an easy decision to focus this book on practical tips to help caregivers during these difficult times.    We understand caregivers have enough to do and are stressed out when their loved one is hospitalized, staying in a care facility or entering hospice.  We are committed to helping you through these challenging times and hope these practical, easy to read tips will help.   Know you have someone (well, actually, five someones) on your team.
