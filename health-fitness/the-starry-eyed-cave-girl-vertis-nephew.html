  <title>The Starry-Eyed Cave Girl - Vertis Nephew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes the journey can be all about the trip.  For Vanessa, simply finding her way across town to school was more of a learning experience than she ever imagined.  Sometimes not always being so sure about where you fit in can be frustrating, especially when you dont have anyone to turn to.  But everyday people that make our lives unique can often be overlooked and underappreciated.  Vanessas journey is a simple one that we all take every day.  Whether we really understand the relationships with our own family or if were curious about the guy sitting next to us on the bus or the girl in class sometimes the journey is all about the way we see the world.
*********************
Most children are believed to have their own set of beliefs and principles influenced by their parents, but their life experiences are the ones that will eventually shape their character and world views.  Readers will witness the simple but lesson-filled saga of one family through the Starry-Eyed Cave Girl, a book by Vertis Nephew.
The Starry-Eyed Cave Girl introduces readers to Juan Guzman and his family as they struggle to beat the odds of life and learn from their experiences.  It explores the lives of each of the members of the Guzman household and highlights their unusual encounters and learning.  The story focuses on Vanessa Guzman, Juans only daughter who goes to a magnet school across town.  Traveling to school for almost two hours every day, Vanessa is exposed to a broad new world both on her journey and her scholastic activities.
An enlightening story for the whole family, the Starry-Eyed Cave Girl is a reflective read that not only infuses positive values, but also shows how new experiences almost always change the way one feels about himself and the people around him.  It explains how parents examples greatly affect their childrens judgment, as they immerse into the lives of each of the characters.  Readers will learn the importance of understanding ones family, appreciating others, and building hope and confidence within themselves as they follow this reality-based story.  It further proves that self-discovery can be a long journey that starts and ends at home." />
