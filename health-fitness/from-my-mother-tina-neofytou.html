  <title>From My Mother - Tina Neofytou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When asking my mother for a recipe she would be more than happy to share it.  Regardless of how closely I followed these though, there always seemed to be a problem with how it turned out....After a few attempts, going back and forth, I was able to narrow in on what was going wrong!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The problem was with the measurements. My mum would have &quot;1 cup&quot; listed however it actually wasnt the &quot;1 cup&quot; we all know to be, it would be &quot;a cup&quot; but a greek coffee cup.  You see my mother had her own measuring system.  It was a beer glass, a mug, a teacup or a Greek coffee cup.  So then every time I would collect a recipe I would ask which cup was she referring too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another challenge was when using flour mum had her &quot;now use as much flour until you feel you have the correct texture&quot;.  Initially this would frustrate me but over time I too began to bake this way.  I just knew by the feel of the dough or batter that I would have a great outcome or an average one. Growing up in a Greek household and being Orthodox allowed me to enjoy and appreciate traditional dishes and Orthodox customs, so I thought by creating this book it would not only be a great keepsake but also a basic reference guide, especially now that I have correct measurements.&lt;/p&gt;" />
