  <title>Walking-Out in Mud &amp; Bruises for a Miracle of Reconciliation - B. Mathew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you want healing for your broken relationship and marital breakdown?
In this book, the author says that as you walk out of your room in torn cloth, shriveled hair, and in mud, with black eyes and bruises all over you, your broken relationship, separation, and divorce will be restored and healed by a miracle of reconciliation. 
The author addresses todays social disease of marital divorces and separation. Whether you are estranged from your spouse or from your loved ones, your family, your friends, your children, your parents, your church members, your pastors, your business partners and associates, or from anyone, the author avers the eternal truth that theres no broken relationship that Christ cannot heal.
The author speaks about root causes of present-day divorces amongst Christians:
	Affliction of generational curses or spiritual affliction
	Ones own inner attitude and mind frame
	Personality traits in individuals
	Direct attacks and causes by demons
He also shows how to tear down these root causes and bring about miracles of restoration for any kind of broken relationships.
The parable of the prodigal son in Luke 15:1131 tells you how the younger son became estranged and suffered a broken relationship with not only his loved ones. His own relationship with God the Father was also broken down. But the prodigal son stopped blaming the devil, others, and God and came to his senses. And thereafter, a miracle of reconciliation took place in his life, and there came a happy ending in his life. 
A happy ending waits for you too.
As you read this book, you too can grasp the revelation of walking out of your room in torn cloth, shriveled hair, and in mud, slime, black eyes, and bruises all over you for the healing of your nightmares of broken relationship, marital separation, and divorce." />
