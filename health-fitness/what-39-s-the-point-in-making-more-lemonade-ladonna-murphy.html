  <title>What&#39;s the Point in Making More Lemonade? - LaDonna Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for those of you who may be going through trials, challenges, and testing seasons. You may even want to give up due to lifes circumstances. Many of us can feel helpless, stressed, depressed, confused, afraid, unsatisfied, lonely, angry, and hopeless at times because of all of the challenges around us. I have written this book because the majority of my life has been a challenge. 
I am blessed with lemon trees! What do you do with a normal fruit tree? You eat the fruit or make something out of it, right? Well, I have enough lemonade to feed many. And I am still here. 
I can be a testimony to others, and so can you. Therefore, if anyone is thinking about the selfish act of suicide, I will just say, Dont do it! It will be too late to say you wish you had not. Think about all those who you will hurt and leave behind. That alone should frighten you! 
Ask for Gods intervention immediately and then seek other counsel. After you read this book, you may be able to identify with some of my lemons, and then you can write about your own. Whatever the situation is, face it and deal with it, and you will get through it. 
Life is full of cycles and seasons, like the weather; therefore, this too shall pass. If giving up is not an option, then what are the alternatives? Start with chapter 1, and make a glass of lemonade! 
Facing it, always facing it, thats the way we get through. Face it. 
Joseph Conrad" />
