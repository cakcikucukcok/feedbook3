      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What you and I need is NOT more information - but Transformation. We need a completely new paradigm for living life and living marriage. As valuable as they are, more books, seminars and sermons will not do the trick. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Jesus said in John 15 - &quot;...apart from me you can do nothing.&quot; Why is it that we keep trying to find a fulfilling marriage without Him? Yes, we may have prayed a salvation prayer once upon a time - but is Jesus really the Lord of our daily, moment-by-moment life and our marriage relationship?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book is NOT about principles for living, or rules for becoming a better husband. This book is about re-connecting you with the Author of marriage, and learning how to once-and-for-all enjoy your wife, and your marriage, as it was intended by God.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Most of us as husbands really don&#39;t have a marriage problem , - we have a Jesus problem. &lt;/P&gt;
