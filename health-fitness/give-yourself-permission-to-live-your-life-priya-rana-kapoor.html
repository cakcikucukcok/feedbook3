  <title>Give Yourself Permission to Live Your Life - Priya Rana Kapoor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Whose life are you living? Though of course you would love to believe that it is fully your own, you might want to think again. Do you find yourself tip-toeing around the feelings of others? Do others desires often precede your own? Do you wish you knew how to balance it all, have healthy relationships, and end up feeling truly happy? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Priya Rana Kapoor takes you on The Permission Journey, a step-by-step guide that will equip you with the strength and courage to:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; have newfound self-confidence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  realise your dreams&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  know you are not alone on your journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.GYSPermission.com&quot;&gt;Give YourSelf Permission to Live Your Life&lt;/a&gt; is complemented with candid anecdotes from Priya&#39;s personal experience. She leads by example as she tells her story of illness, self-doubt, and a chronic need-to-please, how she got through it all, and how you can do the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The breakthrough techniques outlined in The Permission Journey have benefited a wide range of people, from executives of large international corporations ironically suffering from low self-worth, to recent school-leavers struggling to find their feet. Their inspirational stories mirror scenarios that we all commonly find ourselves in, and will serve as a reference point for you in similar situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Are you ready to take the journey yourself? Pack your bags and prepare to embark on an adventure to give yourself permission to take back your life! &lt;/p&gt;
