It is written because AA is tailored towards men. Most recovery programs are, and they are sometimes hard for a woman to grasp the different thinking and tailored approach, alot of twelve step and treatment programs have.<br /><b><i>Happy Hours: Alcohol in a Woman's Life: Jersild, Devon ...</i></b> | Excerpts from Happy Hours, by Devon Jersild... If you look at the studies of enzymes and the studies of responses to alcohol together, a certain commonsense logic emerges. If drinking makes you feel terrible, you're not likely to drink much or often.<br /><b><i>Happy Hours: Alcohol in a Woman's Life by Devon Jersild</i></b> | By adding sociocultural contexts of gender and race to psychological and physiological frameworks, Happy Hours is the most thorough exploration of this subject to date. These women's stories are profoundly moving, and Devon Jersild writes in a style at once scholarly yet accessible, unflinching yet compassionate, objective yet courageously personal.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Happy Hours - Devon Jersild</a> </h3></p><hr/>
