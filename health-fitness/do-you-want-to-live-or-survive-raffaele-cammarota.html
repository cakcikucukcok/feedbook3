  <title>Do you want to live or survive? - Raffaele Cammarota</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Nothing can be realized if it has not been a dream before! To be happy or unhappy, it&amp;rsquo;s a question of choice.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Because life is like a glass: it reflects the way you relate to it. If you fear it, you will get back the object of your fears. If you start fighting against it, it will be a hard battle; if otherwise you finally give up and abandon any form of fighting, then life, pure joy, abundance, happiness will run towards you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Synopsis.&lt;br /&gt;
Learning the art of staying well with ourselves and living happy.&lt;br /&gt;
This first involving book by Raffaele Cammarota is a practical-philosophical-spiritual manual on how to try to achieve harmony of mind, body and soul. On how to have a clear and positive mind; a healthy body and full of energy; a soul free to follow its own aim and to achieve the full self-realization.&lt;br /&gt;
It suggests the fundamental keys to open doors always locked inside us, and finally be able to live in harmony with ourselves and with the world.&lt;br /&gt;
To stop fighting everything and everyone, to learn to accept ourselves, the others, and the events without judging, spontaneously growing the seed that is unique in all of us.&lt;br /&gt;
An illuminating book that, expertly alternating metaphorical language to practical advices, guides the reader towards the discovery and the self-acceptance.&lt;br /&gt;
Like a good tailor he offers the best cloth to use, to be able to leave to each one the task of carving out the tailored suit most suitable for them.&lt;br /&gt;
To finally understand that true life and true happiness are those things that run under our eyes while we are busy and distracted to achieve something else.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
