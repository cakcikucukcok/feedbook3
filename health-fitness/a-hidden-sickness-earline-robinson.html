  <title>A Hidden Sickness - Earline Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Talking about baby momma drama, Keith Dash has endured it all, at least thats what he thought. Nevertheless, hes all man though, and even losing his sons mother, whom he loved dearly, to the streets, never once did he ever think about giving up; for the sake of one last son, he couldnt. 
After the divorce was final, he met her. She was a breath of fresh air. She was beautiful, intelligent, independent, and most importantly, she was a dedicated member of the church society. 
Besides being self-employed and working out of her own home, which she inherited from her biological father, something else was going on in that house, and it had absolutely nothing to do with her beauty salon. 
Were strange things happening because of a longtime friend whom she allowed into her home? Just goes to show that you cannot trust people no more than you can yourself!" />
