          &lt;strong&gt;Does your relationship feel stale, stalled, and strained?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Have you tried, and failed, to sustain a successful connection with a partner? Clinical psychologists Peter Sheras and Phyllis Koch- Sheras have helped thousands of people rejuvenate their relationships to create a meaningful and deeply fulfilling love.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their proven 4-step program is based on a dramatic shift in the way in which relationships are viewed—where the couple is seen as an entity in and of itself, greater than the sum of its individual parts.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Discover the 4 Cs of Lifelong Love, and learn how to:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;- Commit by creating a common vision for you and your partner.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;- Cooperate to achieve the committed vision that you both have for your relationship&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;- Communicate to serve your common vision, not just to meet your own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;- Create communities of other couples who can support and help nurture your relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Filled with stories from the authors’ therapy practice, as well as their 35-year marriage, Lifelong Love provides the tools you and your partner need to create the profoundly satisfying and lasting relationship of your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
