  <title>Dying for a Drink - Dr. Santi Meunier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="America has a secret.&lt;/br&gt;
Hidden beneath underreported and misreported national medical statistics is the sobering fact that alcoholism is the # 2 killer in this country, second only to cancer!&lt;/br&gt;
There are over 20 million active alcoholics in the United States alone, costing the national economy over 30 billion dollars a year. Many believe that the numbers are even higher, since the treatment costs of the multiple physical complications caused by late stage alcoholism are often not included in alcoholism-related statistics.&lt;/br&gt;
Alcoholism is a silent and deadly epidemic that is putting a disastrous strain on the entire global community.&lt;/br&gt;
And it is rapidly getting worse.&lt;/br&gt;
Latest medical discoveries reveal that genetic make-up, hormones, brain chemistry and enzymes all play a crucial role in the evolution of the disease of alcoholism. Shifting societal norms and cultural trends play another.&lt;/br&gt;
At present, significant scientific technology and research is focused on exploring ancient techniques and practices to better understand the sources of their healing potential, as well as the role of neuropeptides and the body&#39;s chemistry for alternative drug therapies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Dying for a Drink&lt;/I&gt; is a timely and groundbreaking book about the three phases of the disease of alcoholism and brings to light the latest developments for successful treatment. The book clearly explains what alcoholism is, what it is not, and, most importantly, what steps to take if you or a loved one is affected. This is a must-read for healthcare professionals, employee assistance workers and individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
Dr. Meunier&#39;s writing style is delightfully user friendly, informative and filled with hope for the individuals and families suffering from this disease.&lt;/p&gt;" />
