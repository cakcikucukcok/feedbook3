  <title>Three Blind Mice - Ian Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some call him a sadist. . . 
Some call him a sociopath. . . 
Only one thing is certain about Sloan Phoenix.
Everyone to ever cross him has regretted it!
Now the most Vindictive man in Carolina Bay has become the newest patient of Doctor Judy Palmer. But can the citys   best psychiatrist bring remorse to a man with a devious mind, a deadly charm and no moral compass?
As Sloan Prepared for his wedding to his fiance, Kristen, he discovered that she planned to leave him for his close friend, Mike Prescott. Having already earned the contempt of Mikes Sister Chloe, their mother, Mrs. Prescott and Sloans Coworker Julian, Sloan laid out an elaborate plot for revenge.
Judy Palmers world crumbles when she discovers her husband, Charlie is having an affair. As her marriage falls apart, Judy falls deeper into Sloans dark world of deception, duplicity and murder. And though she shields herself with principles she swore to uphold, she becomes vulnerable to his words, his charm and what he calls his three rules of engagement for revenge:
Always know your opponent,
Always get the upper hand.
And alwaysalways land on your feet." />
