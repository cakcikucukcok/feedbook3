  <title>I Am Gonna Tell - Jane T. Doe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jane had a pretty good life. She was a single mother, and she worked hard for her three kids, who meant the world to her. One autumn evening she met someone she believed to be the man of her dreamsthe only thing missing in her nearly perfect life. He was handsome, gentle, quiet, and kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven months later, they bought a home and were married. Jane was so happy. Soon, however, her daughter, Michelle, began to change; she became distant and withdrawn. Something was wrong, but Jane couldnt figure out what it was. She never thought to look at her husband as being the cause her daughters moodiness or imagine that it might be somehow related to sexual abuse. Her husbanda young, handsome man with a nine-to-five job, an ex-wife and kids of his ownwas nothing like her image of a pedophile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her memoir, &lt;i&gt;I Am Gonna Tell&lt;/i&gt;, Jane recounts the nightmare that she, her daughter and sons lived through due to the man Jane brought into their lives. This is a mothers brutally honest account of the horrifying discovery of her daughters sexual abuse at the hands of her husbandher daughters stepfather.&lt;/p&gt;" />
