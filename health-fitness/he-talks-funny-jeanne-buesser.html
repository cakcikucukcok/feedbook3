  <title>He Talks Funny - Jeanne Buesser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Jeanne Buesser has written a wonderful and educating story. Many, many children are affected by speech disorders. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The story teaches the reader about this condition which many people are unaware of, especially children.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I applaud Jeanne for raising the awareness of this through a children&#39;s story. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;There is a stigma attached to these kinds of disabilities; people tend to think that children like this are not smart.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This important point is mentioned in the story. Well done.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;DIR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;SHAHIDUN RAHMAN ,Author of Ibrahim where on the spectrum does he belong?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The story &quot; He Talks Funny&quot; is about a &quot;special needs child&quot; who has a neurological speech disorder and cannot be understood when he talks. How his mother helps educate his camp counselor and camp mates about her son&#39;s disability is the essence of the boy&#39;s acceptance into camp. It has been read by speech and language pathologists. They have found it satisfactory.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIR&gt;
