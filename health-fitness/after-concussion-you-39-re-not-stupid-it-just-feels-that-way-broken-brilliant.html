  <title>After Concussion - You&#39;re Not Stupid, It Just Feels That Way - Broken Brilliant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve been blogging about how I recover from mild traumatic brain injury for nearly 10 years now. My last mTBI was in 2004, but I&#39;ve had a number of others, and each one was different. As of December, 2016, nearly a quarter of a million visitors have viewed my posts over half a million times. And each one of the hundreds of people who have left comments, have had a different story to tell, as well as different needs to address after their own brain injuries.  I check my site stats, every now and then, looking over the different ways people have found their way to this site, over the past few years. One thing that comes up a lot is questions about concussion and intelligence - being &quot;stupid&quot; after a concussion.  The main thing I hope to convey to people who come to my blog seeking info and reassurance is:  If you&#39;ve recently (or not so recently) had a concussion, and you&#39;re feeling really stupid, know this:  You are not alone.  This short eBook offers hope. You&#39;re not stupid. You just hurt your head." />
