  <title>Revolving Doors: The True Account of the Full Spectrum of Fostering Abuses of a Boy Before Age Five - Dawn Maree Ketteringham, Richard Ketteringham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;REVOLVING DOORS&quot; is an adult, autobiographical novel in which &#39;Richard&#39;, now in his sixties, recalls incidents of his nightmarish first five years of childhood, while fostered through seventeen residences as a ward of Toronto&#39;s &quot;S.W.York Co. Children&#39;s Aid Society&quot;. From his perspective and understanding as a small child, he shares graphic details of memories of unspeakably perverse mistreatment, including perpetual neglect, abuse, molestation and worse.   After years of counselling and treatment for ensuing, debilitating mental illnesses, &#39;Richard&#39; experienced a &quot;black-out&quot;, resulting in the sudden awareness of long-buried, traumatic memories. The author furnishes vivid details of her brother&#39;s incredible story by interweaving his recollections, and relentless nightmares, with documentation from the organizations involved. It is &quot;Richard&#39;s&quot; most sincere desire that his story of ultimate survival might encourage similar abuse victims who may be searching for hope in facing and fighting their own &quot;demons&quot;." />
