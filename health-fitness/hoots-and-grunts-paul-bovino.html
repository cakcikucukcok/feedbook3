  <title>Hoots and Grunts - Paul Bovino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;Guilty as Charged!&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time or another all of us have been guilty of committing at
least one, and perhaps several, of the most common communication
faux pas that are aptly illustrated in Paul Bovinos opus with a tooth,
Hoots and Grunts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author holds up the mirror, and it is impossible not to recognize
ourselves as we interrupt, off er unsolicited opinions, use communication
devices inappropriately, and unknowingly continue to tarnish our
verbal communication-the image of ourselves that we project, and
consequently, the depth of our relationships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we learn through direct, sometimes somewhat caustically off ered
examples and anecdotes throughout the book, we come to realize that
very often our communication slips are showing, and what comes
from our mouths in the form of words and attitude can inadvertently
be annoying, off -setting, and even a complete turn-off .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While so many of Bovinos observations should ring a bell with most
if not all of us, Hoots and Grunts, with its own somewhat off beat
stylings, off ers solutions for how much of the off ending behavior can
be refi ned, and even demonstrably rectified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoots and Grunts spares few words (and even fewer thoughts and
opinions), and is, at its very least, pointed, and, at its extreme, biting.
But the mirror doesnt lie, and aptly refl ects how we might be being
perceived and subsequently received by others; and, that there is always
room for improvement, resulting in vastly better, and possibly even
profound, communication.&lt;/P&gt;" />
