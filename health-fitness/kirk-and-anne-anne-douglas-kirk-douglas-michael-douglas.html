      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The late film icon and screen legend Kirk Douglas was married to Anne Buydens for more than six decades. Here they both look back on a lifetime filled with drama both on and off the screen. Sharing priceless correspondence with each other as well as the celebrities and world leaders they called friends, &lt;i&gt;Kirk and Anne &lt;/i&gt;is a candid portrayal of the pleasures and pitfalls of a Hollywood life lived in the public eye. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Compiled from Anne&#39;s private archive of letters and photographs, this is an intimate glimpse into the Douglases&#39; courtship and marriage set against the backdrop of Kirk&#39;s screen triumphs, including &lt;i&gt;The Vikings&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Lust For Life&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Paths of Glory&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Spartacus&lt;/i&gt;. The letters themselves, as well as Kirk and Anne&#39;s vivid descriptions of their experiences, reveal remarkable insight and anecdotes about the legendary figures they knew so well, including Lauren Bacall, Frank Sinatra, Burt Lancaster, Elizabeth Taylor, John Wayne, the Kennedys, and the Reagans.
