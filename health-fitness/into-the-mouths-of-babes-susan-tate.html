  <title>Into the Mouths of Babes - Susan Tate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Into the Mouths of Babes is a fabulous bookfull of absolutely everything needed to provide babies with the nutritional foundation to set the stage for a lifetime of health and well-being.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; ~ Christiane Northrup, MD &lt;br /&gt; Ob/Gyn physician and author of the New York Times bestsellers: &lt;br /&gt; Women&#39;s Bodies, Women&#39;s Wisdom and The Wisdom of Menopause&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Into the Mouths of Babes sets the highest standard for books on how to nourish our little ones. Susan elegantly weaves together all the practical details that parents need to know to feed a child in the best possible way: kitchen set-up, recipes, shopping, nutritional insights, food allergies, &lt;br /&gt;and much more. But this book will provide you with more than just great nutrition strategies. &lt;br /&gt;It teaches parents how to raise a child whos healthy in body, mind, heart, and soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~MARC DAVID&lt;br /&gt;Author of Nourishing Wisdom and The Slow Down Diet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading this book is like having a loving godmother in your kitchen, holding your hand while you learn to deeply enjoy feeding your family. Her non-judgmental and holistic approach to healthy cooking empowers parents to embrace this adventure, with a food mill in one hand and &lt;br /&gt;a spice jar filled with Love in the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~KATE SHORT LINDSAY&lt;br /&gt;Holistic Health Coach and Mother&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love beams from every page as Susan Tate so eloquently combines the science of nutrition and the essence of a joy-filled life. This will be the book I gift to all the families I work with as a &lt;br /&gt;holistic birth doula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~DONETTE MORRIS&lt;br /&gt;Mother, Yoga Therapist, and Holistic Birth Doula&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a first time mother-to-be and nutritional novice, I feel well prepared to feed my baby having read Into the Mouths of Babes. Susan Tates philosophy of serving whole foods mixed with sacred nutrients like Love and Respect empowers me to tap my inner wisdom for guidance on what to eat and how to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
