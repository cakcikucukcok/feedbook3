That message has now been extended to this empowering book, offering insights and wisdom that challenge conventional thinking and help you tap into your best, most authentic self. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Humble sees life with unique clarity. In &lt;em&gt;Unlearn,&lt;/em&gt; he opens our eyes to our own lives, helping us to recognize the possibilities that await us and the challenges that prevent us from realizing our dreams.
