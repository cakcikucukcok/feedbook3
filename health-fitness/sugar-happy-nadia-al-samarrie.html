  <title>SUGAR HAPPY - Nadia Al-Samarrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A thought-provoking, yet interesting question: can managing your blood sugar be as simple as what you don&amp;rsquo;t know? I think so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a daughter, sister and wife of family members living with type 2 and type 1 diabetes, I want to share with you what I have learned not only as a family member living with diabetes, but as a columnist diabetes radio host, podcast interviewer, video producer, former diabetes supply store owner, healthcare professional educator and author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information is power! Hence, making informed medical decision can save your life by delaying or preventing diabetes complications. I call this being &amp;ldquo;diabetes literate&amp;rdquo;. As a case in point, the historic 1993 Diabetes in Control and Complications Trial was so conclusive in determining how intensive control of blood sugars dramatically decreases your probability of experiencing complications, that the trial was ended early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My passion for being an advocate of diabetes and teaching you how to advocate for yourself can&amp;rsquo;t be far-fetched; I am an author and AskNadia columnist (ranked #1 by Google), named &amp;ldquo;Best Diabetes Blog for 2017&amp;rdquo; by Healthline and with twenty-three nominations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was not only born into a type 2 diabetes family but also married a type 1. Besides, I was propelled at a young age into &amp;ldquo;caretaker mode&amp;rdquo;. My experience about diabetes gained from childhood has enhanced my knowledge of the scarcity of resources, support, and understanding for people with diabetes. Accordingly, I co-founded Diabetes Interview, now &lt;em&gt;Diabetes Health magazine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are a few packages you can expect from the Sugar Happy Book Guide:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Why diabetes is overwhelming? You are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Diabetes Burnout- how to cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ How to bring down a blood sugar when your glucose meter reads 200 mg/dl or 4.4 mmol/L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Why you can wake up with a high or low blood sugar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Why exercise raises blood sugars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Type 2- going on insulin does not make you a failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ How to avoid or delay diabetes complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Which diet is best for you? There are so many to choose from, and it can be confusing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ The important role of medical devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~The discouraging cost of diabetes and how it can lead to denial and the worst possible outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Financial help with your diabetes supplies and how to apply for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is birthed out of my knowledge, experience and one-on-one interactions with people living with diabetes. I think you will appreciate their personal stories in addition to the medical information it provides. This book without doubt can be used as a guide to help you prevent or delay diabetes complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
