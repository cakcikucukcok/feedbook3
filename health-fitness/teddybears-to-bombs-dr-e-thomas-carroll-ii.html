  <title>Teddybears to Bombs - Dr. E. Thomas Carroll Ii</title>

    &lt;p&gt;
        Our behaviors, emotions, spirituality, aptitudes, internal chemistry and much more, began as far back as when the first man walked the earth.
        Biblically speaking, was that Adam and Eve? Or one of the other humans as stated in the Bible in Genesis? Yes, in the time of Genesis, there were other
        people on Earth and not just Adam and Eve. We will examine some of the aspects regarding growth and development, our personality formation, our inborn
        Temperament, our behaviors, emotions, fears, learning abilities, and how we are affected by our environments and how we affect our environments. We
        begin learning from our environment before our birth and before our parents, too. We are going to begin our journey at the time of conception, or just
        a little before, and follow some of the many paths that directly affect who we become! This journey will also point out how to change negative paths
        into positive goals, and how to learn self-control to help become more successful.
