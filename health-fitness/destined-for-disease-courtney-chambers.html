  <title>Destined for Disease - Courtney Chambers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Destined for Disease&lt;/i&gt; shares a personal journey of one womans life and her experiences being bedridden with fibromyalgia, depression, insomnia, and anxiety (disease). She wants to share what she learned along the way and how it could have been prevented, as well as the therapy (Mickel Therapy) that got her well. Her account about what transpired in order for this all to take place offers an in-depth look at what creates many diseases running rampant in our society today, many in epidemic proportions. She tells of her personal triumph in conquering these debilitating diseases and the message she wants to share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diseases that she explores include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, anxiety, insomnia, migraine headaches, irritable bowel syndrome, and restless leg syndrome (ME, as is recognized in Europe). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her prayer is that through the sharing of this information, many diseases can be prevented, and those with any of these disorders can turn their lives around too. Her purpose is to teach, to allow self-healing and education, to tell the truth about how these illnesses are created, and to give a clear guide on how to change it. All of these conditions are preventable and treatable; it is her purpose to teach this. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, she will start at the beginning. As you go through each chapter, pay attention to the patterns that are being created; you can check with yourself along the way to see if any of this is familiar to you and your life. Even though our stories are different, many times the results are the same: disease.  &lt;/p&gt;
