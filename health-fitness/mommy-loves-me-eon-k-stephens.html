  <title>Mommy Loves Me - Eon K. Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book seeks to enlighten children and parents of the importance of a mothers love to a child. The story shows clearly how much work, commitment, patience, care, and love a mother gives to a child daily. It talks about the routine a mother goes through daily to prepare a child for school. Many times children and parents lose sight of the challenges of early childhood preparation.
The story demonstrates a beautiful relationship between a mother and a daughter illustrated through rabbits. The book shows the journey of a parent-child relationship from the time the childs eyes open and the child gets out of bed in the morning to the time she runs through the door for school. Mommy Loves Me: Before I Go to School is a simple but true caption of a childs heart expressing the love and appreciation from everything a mother does for her. This book is funny and teachable; it identifies the many good gestures done by parents and teaches children to express their love and appreciation. 
Parenting is an awesome responsibility, and children are a blessing from God and should be nurtured and taught moral values by parents. This book shows a beautiful relationship of a little girl and a loving and caring mother. After enjoying Mommy Loves Me, you can enjoy teachable moments with your child reading My Kids Learning Time." />
