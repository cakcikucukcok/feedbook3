  <title>How Do You Kill 11 Million People? (Intl. Ed.) - Andy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;It all comes down to the truth.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Much like the character in one of his best-selling books, Andy Andrews is first and foremost a&lt;I&gt; Noticer.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/I&gt;Sometimes, all one needs is a little perspective and Andy has been providing that perspective to some of the world’s most influential companies and organizations for the last 20 years.&amp;nbsp; His ability to transform an individual by their own understanding and desire has made him loved by millions.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Now, Andy Andrews brings his lessons and perspective into the important arena of government, citizenship, and what it means to completely uphold the truth.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;If the truth is what sets us free, what does it mean to live in a society where truth is absent? How do truth and lies in the past shape our destiny today? Through the lens of the Holocaust, best-selling author Andy Andrews examines the critical need for truth in our relationships, our communities, and our government.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;In this compact, nonpartisan book, Andrews urges readers to be “careful students” of the past, seeking accurate, factual accounts of events and decisions that illuminate choices we face now. By considering how the Nazi German regime was able to carry out over eleven million institutional killings between 1933 and 1945, Andrews advocates for an informed population that demands honesty and integrity from its leaders and from each other. &lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;The future of our country rests on the ability to separate the truth from lies, and Andrews compels each of us to examine our leaders’ claims with a critical eye. His question— how do you kill eleven million people?—is provocative, but his warning is clear: “Only a clear understanding of the answer to this question and the awareness of an involved populace can prevent history from continuing to repeat itself as it already has, time and again.” &lt;/P&gt;" />
