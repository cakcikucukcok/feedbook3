  <title>Happy at Last - Richard O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Undoing Depression&lt;/i&gt; - a groundbreaking program to get happy and stay happy!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you want to live the happiest, most satisfying life possible? Does happiness feel like an elusive goal? According to the most recent developments in psychology and science, the brain can be trained to be more receptive to happiness, because staying happy doesn&#39;t come naturally. Nor does our society make it easy. In &lt;i&gt;Happy at Last, &lt;/i&gt;psychotherapist Richard O&#39;Connor offers new thinking about how we attain and maintain happiness, and he shows us that it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to come at a high cost or in a big package. Rather, we can be in command of our happiness by learning to control how our minds work so that we can identify and savor the hidden positive aspects of everyday life. To do this, O&#39;Connor provides us with a set of skills that will help us re-wire our brains to allow ourselves more joy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filled with practical advice and exercises, &lt;i&gt;Happy at Last&lt;/i&gt; is a step-by-step guide that will help you achieve&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* The core skills that we need to feel happy and fulfilled in today&#39;s world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Strategies for increasing happiness, reducing unnecessary misery, and experiencing greater satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Techniques for keeping sadness at bay and stress from getting in the way of enjoying life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not glib pop psychology but rather the best current science has to offer, put into an accessible and absorbing book. Richard O&#39;Connor makes it possible to be, finally, &lt;i&gt;Happy at Last&lt;/i&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;" />
