  <title>The Marriage Bed Is Pure - William Appiah, Dorothy Appiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The myth and secrecy surrounding sex has been broken and it is a well-known fact that sex issues nowadays, are the most talked about. Information on sex is in abundance everywhere and therefore very easy to access. Though some Christians shy away from this fact and refuse to talk about sex issues when necessary, research proves that one of the reasons why there are many extra-marital affairs among Christians centres on the issue of sex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book, The Marriage Bed Is Pure, is written to inform and educate Christian couples about the purity of the bed. It provides the necessary tips to help couples enjoy good and healthy sexual relationship and to have a fulfilled sex life. The book also argues against the use of modern sex-aids and some of the pornographic styles that have been embraced by some Christians as the norm. The book also stresses the purity of the marital bed and talks about the reason why God is so protective of marital sex. In God&amp;#39;s eyes marriage is very precious, valuable and to be treasured and therefore he says, &amp;quot;Let marriage be held in honour among all&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book with the sub-title; &lt;em&gt;Sex, Honour And Fulfilment In Marriage, &lt;/em&gt;also talks about the sexual act as well as the post-sex issues which are really important in marriage. We provide examples of statements and contributions which people have made during some of our marriage seminars in various places in the United Kingdom. In addition, we also used publications by well-known Christian writers to reiterate certain facts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We explain pertinent sex issues during and after sex using some of the expert Christian writers. For example, on the subject of orgasm, we quoted the explanation offered by Gary Chapman to explain further our point of view. &amp;ldquo;I wish I had known that mutual sexual satisfaction does not require simultaneous climax&amp;rdquo;. Largely because of modern movies, many couples enter marriage with the idea that, &amp;ldquo;every time we have intercourse, we will have simultaneous climax and it will be heaven for both of us.&amp;rdquo; The fact is, seldom do couples experience simultaneous climax or orgasm. What is important is that each of you experience the pleasure of climax or orgasm. Such pleasure does not have to come simultaneously. In fact, many wives indicate that they much prefer to reach orgasm as a part of foreplay. When his stimulation of the clitoris gives her the pleasure of orgasm, she is now ready for him to complete the act of intercourse and experience the pleasure of climax. The unrealistic expectation of simultaneous climax has produced unnecessary anxiety for many couples.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book also features the issues of performance, pornography and the use of sex toys in Christian marriages. Some Christian men believe that pornography will enhance their sex life, only to find out too late that they are addicted to it and find it difficult to demonstrate genuine love in their marriage. Some end up as sexual perverts. Others tend to find out that it actually distorts God&amp;rsquo;s gift of sex which should be shared in the marital relationship. It also exposes some men&amp;rsquo;s sexual insecurity in the marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other men also begin to compare the sexual performance of their spouse to the pornographic actors which often is unrealistic and debasing. It is akin to attacking the dignity of your wife. This is debasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, the best known secret for maintaining relationships in marriage is disclosed. This secret, if well mastered as explained in the book, will lead to a long lasting, sustainable marriage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
