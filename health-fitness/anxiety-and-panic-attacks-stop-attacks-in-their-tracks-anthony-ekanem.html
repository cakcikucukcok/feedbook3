  <title>Anxiety and Panic Attacks: Stop Attacks In Their Tracks! - Anthony Ekanem</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your heart is pounding fast and you are feeling dizzy.  It seems as though you have to sit down in order for you not to fall.  You are having trouble catching your breath. You are experiencing a numbing feeling in your hands and feet.     There is a tightening pressure in your chest area.  You think you may be on the verge of a heart attack.  You think something is really wrong with you; however, you are far from dying.  Anxiety is a mental disorder in which a person fears just about anything and they think every outcome will turn out for the worst.  This fear is frightening because it is so intense and they always fear that someone is after them.    If you have any type of disorder that is associated with anxiety, then your mind will always be focused on being scared for no reason.  You will always feel that there is no solution to your unfounded fear and that there is no way out." />
