  <title>Finding Hope in the Age of Anxiety - Claire Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I can&#39;t face this. No one understands how hard it is for me. People are looking at me. Why am I like this? Why can I not be like everyone else? What&#39;s wrong with me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sound familiar?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thoughts such as these can trigger us to feel anxious, stupid, upset and frustrated. We have choices. We can blame ourselves and others, avoid certain situations and worry. Or we can acknowledge our thoughts and feelings and take our power back from anxiety by facing it with understanding, courage and compassion. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here, taking a self-compassionate approach, Dr Claire Hayes presents anxiety as a normal part of every stage of life, from childhood through to adolescence and adulthood. Using the principles of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dr Hayes helps us to recognise, understand and take control of the unhelpful thoughts, beliefs and actions that cause anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book offers hope to people who struggle with anxiety, as well as to those who support them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&#39;Helps us understand how we contribute unwittingly to our own difficulties, how we can change the way we think, feel and act, and thus live a more fulfilling life.&#39; &lt;/em&gt;Dr Rosaleen McElvaney, Clinical Psychologist, Psychotherapist and Lecturer, School of Nursing and Human Sciences, DCU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Offers gentle ways to hope and cope in the Age of Anxiety.’ &lt;/em&gt;Professor Philip C. Kendall, Temple University, Philadelphia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Truly outstanding … I can think of no other work in this area that I would recommend as strongly.’ &lt;/em&gt;Mark Morgan, Cregan Professor of Education and Psychology, DCU&lt;/p&gt;" />
