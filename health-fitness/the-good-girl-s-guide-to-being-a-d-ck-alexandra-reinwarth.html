  <title>The Good Girl’s Guide To Being A D*ck - Alexandra Reinwarth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Full of brilliant imagery, genial quotations and latter-day Victorian idiosyncrasies, A Golden Age of Cycling brings to life the timeless and inclusive joys of cycling.
Born in Hammersmith in 1879, Charles James Pope was part of the generation of cyclists who cycled in a golden era, the time of pioneer cycling writer Wayfarer and of the Cycle Club. His diaries beautifully describe the adventures of Charles and his brother&#39;s annual holidays and short breaks, each spent cycling from one destination to the next, whilst stopping at various established cycling watering holes for their bread, cheese and a well-earned pint of ale.
Wonderfully written and including some brilliant original photography from their journeys, Charles&#39; diaries describe the feeling of being able to travel on the new roads of Britain without the dangers of heavy traffic, and of an age when time moved at a more peaceful pace." />
