  <title>Conscious Endeavor: Discover Your Truth, Meaning and Create a Purposeful Life - Lee Davy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Re-Think What You Think You Know...In a world in which programming is paramount from the time of our inception and an age in which our very existence is in question and is a direct reflection of this programming, the time is NOW to barter for a better world. Across the planet, communities are waking to the realization that CHANGE is required across all facets of society. A Conscious Endeavor delves into the underbelly of the current state of affairs of a societal model built on deception, lies, competition and reactionary means of wellness (meaning once we are sick then we act), details the over 25 years experiential journey of author Lee Davy and the tools to create health, happiness and abundance through the 4 Pillars (spiritual, emotional, mental and physical) of health. Finally, A Conscious Endeavor proposes the opportunity for a new model of society. A society based in full disclosure and truth, one proposing collaboration, creativity and preventative measures to help YOU Discover Your Truth, Meaning and Create a Purposeful Life - A way in which we were all meant to live.&lt;/p&gt;" />
