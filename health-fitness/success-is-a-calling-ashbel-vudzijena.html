  <title>Success Is a Calling! - Ashbel Vudzijena</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many are the plans in a man&#39;s heart, but it is the LORD&#39;s purpose that prevails. (Proverbs 19:21)
Its high time we realize that in the same way that life, in its broader version is a calling, success is similarly a calling. Nothing stands in the way of your calling, even a thousand troops! You cant even stand in the way of your own calling. Jonah failed to stop himself from succeeding.
No matter how much you try, your success can only materialize if God wills. On the other hand, no matter how hard you try to avoid it, you will succeed if it is the plan of God for you to succeed. He will lead you to places, people, circumstances, colleges, cities and villages that ensure your success. Among the various options life seems to offer, the best and only viable option is the plan of God for your life as an individual. The plan of God is ever inviting you towards the direction of your calling. If you dont look for success, it will still look for you if it is your calling for you to succeed in a particular way.
This book helps you to rely on Gods plan for every minute of your life. Seek to find out this plan. Everyone has a calling. You have a calling upon your life. A calling makes success inevitable, unavoidable. Success is not corruption or nepotism. It is not a beautiful plan, a sound education or an insightful workshop. All factors can only propel you or apply in your life if there is a calling for that kind of success, first and foremost. Let your own plan give way to the plan of God for your life. Your destiny is guaranteed.
A desire for success is like a smell. When you detect it you know the source is around. You can tell the level of success you will attain by the natural, not artificial, desire you have for it. Your desire does not give you a future. Instead it is the guaranteed future that gives you a desire for it. A desire is therefore a signal not the fuel towards the success that you are guaranteed by way of a calling. Read this book and realize that ultimate success is unconscious. It is a calling." />
