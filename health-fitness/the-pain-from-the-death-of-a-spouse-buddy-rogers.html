  <title>The Pain from the Death of a Spouse - Buddy Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once you turn the page of life, you cannot turn it back. &lt;em&gt;The Pain from the Death of a Spouse&lt;/em&gt; revisits life with the living and documents the death, pain, and sorrow that will eventually come to every marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book introduces a door that every married couple will walk through, usually not together. A door that we dont like to acknowledge or even admit exists. It is the door of reality. One spouse will die before the other in almost every marriage. My spouse walked through the door and left me on the opposite side. This is my story after the door closed behind her. It is a story that speaks to the soul of mankind about life, love, marriage, death, and sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;You might ask, What gives the author the insight, the expertise, the knowledge, and the experience to write about the pain that one suffers from the death of a family member?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps its the pain he suffered from the death of his nineteen-year-old sister, and&lt;br /&gt;
perhaps its the pain he suffered from the death of his father, and&lt;br /&gt;
perhaps its the pain he suffered from the death of his mother, and&lt;br /&gt;
perhaps its the pain he suffered from the death of his brother, and&lt;br /&gt;
perhaps its the pain he suffered from the death of his spouse of fifty-five years, or&lt;br /&gt;
maybe its the love, support, and comfort God gave him during each of these deaths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
