  <title>Little Notes  on Autumn Leaves - Frank A. Little</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Drawing from a wealth of material produced over the course of more than thirty years, Frank A. Littles latest book: Little Notes on Autumn Leaves -- a Collection of New and Selected Poems and Quotes, displays the remarkable range of his Life-Learned Little notes based on his innate observation of the world around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The introduction is beautifully written, but doesnt do justice to the powerful and unexpected emotions that are provoked by the remainder of this written art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littles new book opens with quotes and poems from 2008 forward; each one reflecting on, and is inspired by, his life-altering incidental diagnosis of gastric cancer and his formidable unsuspecting follow-on treatment. Previously selected quotes and poems were chosen for their motivational impact on the author himself . . . surviving the seemingly unsurvivable, doing the undoable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Littles poems and quotes reflect the profound impact of his lifes observations. His written words captivate you . . . as they stimulate your innermost thought. Little Notes on Autumn Leaves reads like an elegant and sophisticated runway show where a seasoned fashion designer has finally shared his dearest and most precious garments in an artistic, cohesive expression of love for lifes cycle of changes and renewals. &lt;br /&gt;Quietly Powerful! This is Frank A. Little at his best.&lt;/p&gt;" />
