  <title>Why Did You Have to Get a Divorce? And When Can I Get a Hamster? - Anthony E. Ph.D. Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Definitive advice from the author of the bestselling &lt;i&gt;&quot;Get out of my life&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divorce, argues Anthony E. Wolf, does not have to do long-term damage to a child. In his groundbreaking new book, he shows parents how to steer children through the pain and the complex feelings engendered by divorce, feelings that, if not resolved, can create continuing problems for a child. Wolf also explains how to deal with the difficult issues that so frequently accompany a divorce. How do you tell your child about the divorce? How do you keep your children from being caught between you and your ex-partner? What do you do if that other parent gradually fades out of their lives? Or, how do you maintain strong ties with your children if you are not the primary custodial parent? How do you help them cope with new living arrangements, as well as stepparents or stepsiblings? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Why did you have to get a divorce?&quot;&lt;/i&gt; is filled with stories that parents will recognize with relief. Positive, at times even funny, and, above all, effective, this guide will speak directly to divorcing and divorced parents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
