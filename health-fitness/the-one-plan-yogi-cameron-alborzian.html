      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What if you could follow a program that, like in so many other books, helped you get results in only a couple of weeks? As with these other programs, you could lose weight, attract more beneficial relationships, and find a greater state of balance in very little time. But what if, on top of all that, the program helped you create not just a fast change, but a permanent one? What if you had a plan that has all the benefits of a short-term overhaul but with the guidance necessary to ensure that it&amp;#39;s the last program you&amp;#39;ll ever need?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over two thousand years ago, the Indian sage Patanjali compiled what we now know as &lt;em&gt;The Yoga Sutras&lt;/em&gt;, a concise text that forms the basis of everything we know today about the philosophy of the yogic path. In &lt;em&gt;The One Plan&lt;/em&gt;, Yogi Cameron lays out a fifty-two-week structure based on Patanjali&amp;#39;s teachings as well as the ancient medical system of Ayurveda; it delivers the proven authenticity of an ancient path but has been adapted to take your life in the modern world into account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a practical and accessible guide to help you improve your life, &lt;em&gt;The One Plan&lt;/em&gt; will provide you with specific exercises and regimens for crafting an effective daily routine, tips and reminders for becoming truly grounded in that routine, real-life stories and inspiration, practical tools for responding to life&amp;#39;s inevitable struggles and setbacks, and even a section on eating the Ayurveda way. By following the One Plan, you will live a life of health, balance, and purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your commitment to the One Plan may last fifty-two weeks, but the changes you make will last a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
