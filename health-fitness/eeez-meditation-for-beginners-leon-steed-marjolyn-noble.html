      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Would you rather experience a life crippled by negativity, pessimism, and fatalismor one blooming with passion, optimism, and beauty? Would you rather be the champion of your own lifeor just a participant? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can be the change you desire in your own lifeyou simply need to start making decisions that invite joy, prosperity, and peace to you. Sometimes, what seems like a coincidence is much more. Those who surge forward in this life simply know how to recognize these sacred moments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Marjolyn Noble, her sacred moment happened in a local fitness centre. Thats where she met Leon Steed, a personal trainer who would become instrumental in encouraging his new client to create the life of her dreams. Two years and twenty-six kilograms lighter, Marjolyn had formed a new partnership Leon that was teeming with energy. They decided to share this amazing process with others because their journey can inspire yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all started on 11/11/11, when Leon recorded his Butterfly Guided Meditation to a CD. Inspired by the beautiful transformative journey of the butterfly, these guided meditations are designed to help you emerge, transformed and reborn. Meditation can help reduce stress, increase concentration, boost creativity, enhance your confidence, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we can achieve when we release our outdated beliefs and embrace a new way of being. Will you stay grounded and crawl through lifeor will you embrace your destiny as a beautiful, soaring creation of the universe? Your new life awaits!&lt;/p&gt;" />
