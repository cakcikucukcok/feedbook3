  <title>Cast Down But Not Destroyed - One Woman&#39;s Story of Overcoming Abuse - Samantha Ph.D. Phillips, Dr. Dr. Myles Munroe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;You can be free from cycles of abuse &amp; failure in life! God, through&lt;br&gt;the power of Jesus Christ, changed my life and took me from cycles &lt;br&gt;of abuse and self-destructive behavior to living a life full of love and &lt;br&gt;success! There is real power in faith, so much more than just a church &lt;br&gt;experience!  While this is the story of how I overcame cycles of child-&lt;br&gt;hood and adult abuse, this book will inspire anyone who has road &lt;br&gt;blocks to overcome on their way to living out their God given destiny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I pray that the pages inside this book will inspire you to overcome and&lt;br&gt;live a Champion&amp;#39;s lifestyle!&amp;quot;  &amp;ndash; Dr. Samantha Phillips&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book is indispensable reading for anyone who wants to overcome&lt;br&gt;the scars of past hurts and live life above the norm. This is a profound&lt;br&gt;authoritative work which expresses the wisdom of the ages and yet&lt;br&gt;breaks new ground in its approach in tackling this sensitive subject and &lt;br&gt;will possibly become a classic in this and the next generation. This &lt;br&gt;exceptional work by Samantha Phillips is one of the most profound, &lt;br&gt;practical, principle-centered approaches to this highly sensitive subject &lt;br&gt;I have read in a long time.   - Dr. Myles Munroe, BFM International" />
