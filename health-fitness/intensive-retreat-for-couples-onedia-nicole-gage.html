      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Marriage is hard work! Make no mistake! It is daily work! No breaks! No vacations! No time outs! The first step to establishing the legacy you desire is to remember what your spouse needs from you, expects from you, and gives to you through his life, his heart, his sacrifices, his energy, his time, and his talent. Your husband does things that he has never done as a man and he gives more of himself than he ever has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your marriage deserves the best of you, your time, your energy, and your focus. How do I do that? You have to keep your marriage first&amp;mdash;this means that you protect the time designed for your marriage. Give it ALL of you! He deserves all of you. Your marriage has to last for the rest of your life, so you need to do what is necessary to insure that your spouse knows that he is first right after God. Your time is valuable to him. Do you remember when you were in love with him? You could not wait until you were in his presence again. You workday was too long. Traffic was too much. All you wanted to do was see him. Now you are married. You are not in a hurry to get home. You are not thinking of her as much. Your dialogue and communication are severely lower, strained and critically different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He notices. He questions you. You deny. He argues his point with irrefutable evidence. You continue the denial response. You are successful&amp;mdash;he relinquishes. But he is right. He is hurt. He retaliates. He sleeps in another room. Your marriage just changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Intensive Retreat for Couples is designed to revive, restore, and recreate your marriage through your intensive and intentional participation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
