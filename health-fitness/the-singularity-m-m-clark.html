  <title>The Singularity - M. M. Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There comes a time for everyone when knowing something deeper about life changes from idea to action. You have begun to feel the greater consciousness pushing you to accept responsibility for what you have created and sparking a desire for growth and movement forward into the possibilities of a higher-evolved humanity.
Whatever has brought you to this moment, now is the time. You are suddenly aware that you are ready to realize the truth of the life you have chosen. This is called the search. Searching can never end for some because they are looking outside for answers that already lie deep within them. The search only ends when you find your own truth, and no one can supply that for you. You need the courage to look within to discover your truth.
The path of the singularity is not hard; it only takes a little courage.
The power you have to create is unlimited when awareness of its existence is awakened. If perfection is what you are searching for, that perfection already lives within you. Your search is over." />
