  <title>Conquering the Eneme! - Annette Jones-Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I personally would like to thank everyone that has purchased and read this book and hope that it has blessed your lives as this journey has blessed mine.  If I can help somebody as I pass this way then my living will not be in vain.  All too often, we go thru trials in life and some are so shameful we wish to forget them and never mention them.  Sometimes we are convinced we are alone in a trial of this magnitude and that surely no one would ever understand this madness.  If the devil can convince you of this he has won because his job is to isolate us so that depression takes over or rather as the word tells us to sift us as wheat, One thing Ive learned in the last several years of my life that even though its my story, its for Gods glory.  Situations that are shameful, hurtful, no matter what, theres a lesson which in turn is a blessing.  Quite often the trial or situation is not even about me, but God allowed me to endure it because he trusts me to share it with someone struggling in the same area and to reach back and pull someone else forward.  The devil has often tried to convinced me that its my fault for my trials and something Ive either done wrong or simply that God has turned his back on me and is ignoring me.  I know for myself that the only thing God cant do is lie and fail and in his word he says that he will NEVER leave me or forsake me so in that I know the trial is for another reason and not because God has bailed out on me.  Ive learned to apply I Thessalonians 5:18 In everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.  Be Blessed and Be a Blessing and remember to live a life of Purpose and on Purpose, Its yours.Walk in it!!!" />
