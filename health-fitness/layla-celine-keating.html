  <title>Layla - Celine Keating</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A young woman embarks on a life-changing cross-country trip to face a family secret rooted in America&amp;#39;s most turbulent decade.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;Layla James, a recent graduate and budding photographer, never knew anything about her father except that he named her for the iconic song by Eric Clapton. Her mother--steeped in a political activism that Layla rejects--kept their past shrouded in secrecy, and when she dies of cancer, she leaves only an enigmatic letter--the first in a series that will lead Layla through a cross-country network of &amp;#39;60s radicals and closer to the bombshell at the heart of her parents&amp;#39; past. As Layla makes her way from the East Coast to a commune in the California desert, she discovers more about friendship, love, forgiveness, and the personal repercussions of political activism than she could ever have imagined. A stirring and panoramic story, viewed through the lens of the next generation, this exceptional debut novel brings the gestalt of the &amp;#39;60s into focus and sheds new light on the era&amp;#39;s legacy in the new millennium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Back Cover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Celine Keating&amp;#39;s deftly plotted novel takes readers on a gripping journey along the underground railroad of post-&amp;#39;60s radicalism. . . . Every adult has to reinterpret the story of her childhood. Keating beautifully demonstrates the courage it takes for each of us to face that bittersweet truth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
