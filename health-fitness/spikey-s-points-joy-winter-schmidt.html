  <title>Spikey’S Points! - Joy Winter-Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spikeys Points is a fable about a poetic porcupine with mostly good points, sharing many life lessons. Spikey is bullied and ostracized, but has chosen to be the park peacemaker, with his mentor Grammy. By being kind and helpful, they make the world a better place, and encourage others to keep their faith in humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALL STAR CAST: Back Row: LARRY Law, Coach BOB, Ms SARAH Bell, MR. T (Joe Taylor) The STAR represents Music STAR: (male or female in Sequel 1 only) GRAMMY (Mary) SPIKEY, MISTY. Front Row: Brothers: MARK &amp; BEN Law, KERI Bell, LISA, Sisters: SALLY &amp; TIA, PUNKY, JESSICA, VP Ms Radcliffe &amp; daughter ROBYN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spikey, the all positive star of this musical, is a 6 foot tall porcupine, who speaks in rhymes. The energetic singing and dancing of the 20 local performers, aged 8 to 55, keep young audiences entertained throughout! Kevin Prokosh, Winnipeg Free Press&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My Kindergarteners enjoyed the music and Spikey himself! Shara Ewasiuk, Kindergarten Teacher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spikey opens stage doors for all ranges, ages and sizes of actors. The musical features powerful messages concerning inclusion and anti-bullying, appealing to all audiences - Katherine Quinton, K-12 Teacher, Winnipeg, Manitoba Canada&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for coming to Brandon! I have enjoyed many Spikey performances and no two are ever exactly the same. Love the diversity!! My 3 year old granddaughter had fun and lasted at least 45 minutes and after a little activity break was able to enjoy the final song reaching to the sky : ) She loved the audience participation. My 29 year old daughter in law thought it was humorous. My 80 year old mom enjoyed it and like myself, was so impressed with the rhyme and music with so much meaning!!  So it really is a generational presentation with something for everyone!! Best of all, it promotes such great values!! Shelly Gurr, EA, Brandon School Division Performance K-6 / Community Living, June 2015.&lt;/p&gt;" />
