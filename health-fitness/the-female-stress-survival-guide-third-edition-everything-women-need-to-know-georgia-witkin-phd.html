  <title>The Female Stress Survival Guide Third Edition: Everything Women Need to Know - Georgia Witkin, PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;I hope this book helps you help yourself live with female stress so that you can manage it rather than have it manage you. Knowledge is power, so read on.&quot; &amp;#8212;Dr. Georgia Witkin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new Third Edition updated to address 21st-century concerns, the noted stress expert, psychologist, author, and TV commentator has thoroughly revised and expanded her classic bestseller, which has sold over 200,000 copies and been translated into 9 languages. &quot;New stresses, such as mastering the computer or kids returning home, have not replaced the old stresses&amp;#8212;just multiplied them,&quot; Dr. Witkin writes. She shows us how we can learn to cope and conquer, helps us identify &quot;the female stress syndrome,&quot; teaches us to use stress to our advantage, and, most important, she describes clearly many proven physical and mental techniques for successful stress management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive and thoughtful, refreshingly honest, spiced with real-life anecdotes, quizzes, checklists, and a &quot;female stress questionnaire,&quot; Dr. Georgia Witkin covers a wide range of concerns for women of all ages, including chapters on family, love and sex, teens, aging, men, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
