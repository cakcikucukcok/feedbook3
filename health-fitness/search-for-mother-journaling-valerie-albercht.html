  <title>Search for Mother Journaling - Valerie Albercht</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her first book, &lt;i&gt;Search for Mother&lt;/i&gt;, author Valerie Albrecht related her natural therapy birthing work in Australia, India and North America. Through this she unearthed profound questions about the idea of motherher forms, her essences, her joy and her dualities. Valeries work, writing and relationship with her own mother brought a longing to connect with the who and why of mother: the one we have, the one we yearn for, the one we become and the one we strive to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the need to fathom mother and to puzzle out the persistent emergence of complexity and dichotomies in motherhood, Albrecht presents this companion volume. It offers a structure and writing process for the exploration of mother through organizing our experiences with our Mothers of Origin, the forms in which we encounter her in our lives, and with our Mothers of Power, the intrinsic natures and essences of her, which we may or may not have encountered. By reflecting on and journaling these mother connections it is Valeries heartfelt hope that we: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;deepen our knowledge of motherhood&lt;/br&gt;
embrace our mother experiences, both positive and negative&lt;/br&gt;
enhance and inspire our innate resources to mother ourselves and others&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
