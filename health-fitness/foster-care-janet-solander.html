  <title>Foster Care - Janet Solander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Foster Care: How to Fix This Corrupted System&lt;/em&gt;, author Janet Solander presents stories of how Child Protective Services (CPS), Department of Family Services (DFS), and the foster system have failed the very children they are mandated to protect and hold safe. Solander shares heartbreaking incidents taken from the daily news as well as her own firsthand experiences as a foster parent. Only through public awareness is there any chance that the children in the system have any hope of being protected the way they should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every child has the right to a safe and secure home, but foster children sometimes find that being in the system brings them to a worse place than the home from which they were taken. Only through public involvement pressuring lawmakers to correct the shortcomings in the system will the innocent victims, the children, have the chance the system promises them. &lt;em&gt;Foster Care &lt;/em&gt;explains what is happening with these children and what we can do to help correct this dire situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When foster parents and children gain a stronger voice to advocate for them, only then will the system be able to take care of those who are most vulnerable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
