  <title>Aspire Awaken Actualise - Mavis Ureke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To the Readers of Aspire Awaken Actualize:
I have been a trainer and mentor for corporates and individuals who are all on this journey of transformation. In sharing a life picture exercise, which is one of my tools for developing self-awareness, I realized everyone has something to teach about this journey of transformation. Every individual on this journey acquired skills, used tools and techniques that if shared can also help others on their journey. This book series is a toolbox where you can draw out various tools when you need them. The series will give practical tips, tools and techniques as applied by the individual authors on their own journey and also as they assist their clients to transform their lives. It is a collection of experiences from the various authors. For the past decade, I have seen people wanting to change, but stuck, not knowing or not having the tools to assist them in transformation, hence the idea of Aspire, Awaken, and Actualize. 
As you read this book, you will be exploring practical self-development tools and techniques with proven results. Dr Wayne Dyer said, All we need is already here, we just need to see it. We have to awaken so we can actualize. Reading this book is like walking the journey of transformation with the authors who are exploring the unlimited possibilities to being. 
I started this series to bring authors with various expertise together with readers with the various needs. When you read this series it will assist you in the key areas of your life that you may be looking to transform. This is the first book in the series.
The series will embrace each of the following areas: 
	Spiritual wellness and well-being 
	Physical wellness and well-being
	Relationship awareness 
	Personal growth and career attainment of goals 
	Parenting children with special needs 
	Parenting in the age of transformation 
	Values-based living 
	Financial wellness
	Dealing with Grief 
	And many more areas that require our shift in awareness to the continual journey of transformation 
These perspectives come into alignment with managing emotions for success, understanding and leveraging the drivers of behavior to achieve your outcomes. My advice is this work is a buy ten to share with friends pledge." />
