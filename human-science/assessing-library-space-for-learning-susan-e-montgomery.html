  <title>Assessing Library Space for Learning - Susan E. Montgomery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;With the surge in electronic access to the library&amp;rsquo;s resources, there has been an ongoing discussion about the need for a physical library building. On a college or university campus, the library is a destination for its users. Students, faculty and staff go to the library for various reasons. Their usage makes the academic library a valuable learning space on campus. However, not much is known about how the library space contributes to user learning. In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Assessing Library Space for Learning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, chapters discuss library usage at academic institutions and how that usage is an integral part of the student learning experience. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Included are the perspectives of an architect who is tasked with designing library spaces with learning in mind, a psychologist whose professional research focuses on the concept of place, and a dynamic group of academic librarians who are dedicated to making the library conducive to the needs of their learners. This book is a combination of theory, practical and research based chapters with an overall focus on library space and learning. The authors discuss the intersections of library space and learning demonstrating the importance of the library space in our users&amp;rsquo; lives. In addition, the authors discuss the importance of determining ways to learn how library space contributes to user learning. Readers will gain an understanding of the library space as a valuable learning space and the steps librarians need to take to assess learning in the academic library.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
