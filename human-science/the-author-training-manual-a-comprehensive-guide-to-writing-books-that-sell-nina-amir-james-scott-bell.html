  <title>The Author Training Manual: A Comprehensive Guide to Writing Books That Sell - Nina Amir, James Scott Bell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you want to write a book that&#39;s going to sell to both publishers and readers, you need to know how to produce a marketable work and help it become successful. It starts the moment you have an idea. That&#39;s when you begin thinking about the first elements of the business plan that will make your project the best it can be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The reality is that you don&#39;t want to spend time and energy writing a book that will never get read. The way to avoid that is to create a business plan for your book, and evaluate it (and yourself) through the same lens that an agent or acquisitions editor would. &lt;i&gt;The Author Training Manual&lt;/i&gt; will show you how to get more creative and start looking at your work with those high standards in mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Whether you&#39;re writing fiction or non-fiction, or intend to publish traditionally or self-publish, author Nina Amir will teach you how to conduct an effective competitive analysis for your work and do a better job at delivering the goods to readers than similar books that are already on the shelf.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Packed with step-by-step instructions, idea evaluations, sample business plans, editor and agent commentaries, and much more, &lt;i&gt;The Author Training Manual&lt;/i&gt; provides the information you need to transform from aspiring writer to career author.&lt;/p&gt;" />
