  <title>Evolution of Darkness - Hyginus Mathurin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world of technological revelations and human genius, organized religions continue to hold on to the element of faith. There are many religious questions that are satisfactorily answered in science, yet conveniently ignored by the faithful. Amidst the numerous scientific breakthroughs of the 21st Century, some still see science as the opposite of religion, even when the evidence is convincing that the two are complementary.
Evolution of Darkness invites its readers to step out of the box to consider a few ideas on the dogmas that dominate religious thoughts and influences. On Christmas Eve 2012, I was invited to a candle lighting ceremony when it struck me that the Darkness we were driving out  sat at the center of the flames we were holding in our hands.  In other words, the Darkness in the center of the candle was responsible for the flame that provided the light in the room. 
This discovery enhanced my perception that the Darkness we see is the color of the energy that permeates the cosmos.  Evolution of Darkness contends that this energy is intelligent and is the only authority capable of creating and sustaining this universe we live in. Every aspect of life, whether animate or inanimate, represents an expression of the Evolution of Darkness.
The only legitimate expression of the God of creation is Darkness/Energy.  Everything from electromagnetism to righteousness and faith are attributes of Dark Energy. From a realistic perspective, the Creator of this violent system is not a morally good God, but a God who has created a system that satisfies His needs. Everything we see around us is necessary and creates the perfect balance for the constant operation of the universe." />
