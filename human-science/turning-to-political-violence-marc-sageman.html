  <title>Turning to Political Violence - Marc Sageman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What motivates those who commit violence in the name of political beliefs? Terrorism today is not solely the preserve of Islam, nor is it a new phenomenon. It emerges from social processes and conditions common to societies throughout modern history, and the story of its origins spans centuries, encompassing numerous radical and revolutionary movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marc Sageman is a forensic psychiatrist and government counterterrorism consultant whose bestselling books &lt;i&gt;Understanding Terror Networks&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Leaderless Jihad&lt;/i&gt; provide a detailed, damning corrective to commonplace yet simplistic notions of Islamist terrorism. In a comprehensive new book, &lt;i&gt;Turning to Political Violence&lt;/i&gt;, Sageman examines the history and theory of political violence in the West. He excavates primary sources surrounding key instances of modern political violence, looking for patterns across a range of case studies spanning the French Revolution, through late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century revolutionaries and anarchists in Russia and the United States, to the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand and the start of World War I. In contrast to one-dimensional portraits of terrorist &quot;monsters&quot; offered by governments and media throughout history, these accounts offer complex and intricate portraits of individuals engaged in struggles with identity, injustice, and revenge who may be empowered by a sense of love and self-sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arguing against easy assumptions that attribute terrorism to extremist ideology, and counter to mainstream academic explanations such as rational choice theory, Sageman develops a theoretical model based on the concept of social identity. His analysis focuses on the complex dynamic between the state and disaffected citizens that leads some to disillusionment and moral outrage&amp;mdash;and a few to mass murder. Sageman&#39;s account offers a paradigm-shifting perspective on terrorism that yields counterintuitive implications for the ways liberal democracies can and should confront political violence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
