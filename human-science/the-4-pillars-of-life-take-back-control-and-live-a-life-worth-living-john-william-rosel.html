  <title>The 4 Pillars of Life: Take Back Control and Live a Life Worth Living - John William Rosel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Old Boys&amp;rsquo;, men in their 30&amp;rsquo;s, 40&amp;rsquo;s and 50&amp;rsquo;s, tend to be a forgotten breed. With a growing career, family, and responsibilities, the carefree life of youth seems a distant memory, and an Old Boy wonders that surely there must be more to life than this? But society dictates we &amp;ldquo;Suck it up Princess and just get on with it&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 4 Pillars of Life is a book written for Old Boys by an Old Boy that provides a journey of self-discovery through the maze of what makes a Life Worth Living.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all want to Live a Life Worth Living, live an adventurous life, and have a story to tell when we are older, but too many of us just &amp;lsquo;get by&amp;rsquo;, we watch as other people seem happy and content, or are successful, and all we do is look for reasons why it doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for us. We have regrets about the past, we worry about the future, and we just let the adventure of life slip by.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is an opportunity for Old Boys to have a look at themselves and their lives, in their own time and in their own way. It is a journey of self-discovery through the maze of what makes a Life Worth Living. It is a guide to living a richer and fuller life, and a course of action to being a better man, in a world where the image and expectations of what a man should be, has been distorted beyond recognition, and seemingly beyond the achievement of the average Old Boy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
