  <title>Arts in Health - Daisy Fancourt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past few decades, the use of the arts in health has burgeoned. What, for many centuries, was seen as a fringe activity is now being recognised as a field that has enormous potential for impacting positively on both individuals and societies. However, despite this surge in interest and activity, there is still limited support available for people working in the field. Although the number of practical training courses for artists is growing and more
universities are establishing research groups, most training activity occurs in either practice or research; there are relatively few opportunities to gain parallel experience in both.
Arts in Health: Designing and Researching Interventions provides a complete overview of how to go about undertaking research and practice in the field of arts in health. It starts by exploring the context for arts in health interventions, including the history of the use of arts in health and the theoretical and political developments that have laid the foundations for its flourishing. It also considers what &#39;arts in health&#39; encompasses and the range of disciplines involved.
Part II examines how to design an arts in health intervention, develop partnerships and find funding and considers the sensitivities around working in healthcare.
Part III considers the value of research for the field of arts in health and how to design and undertake a research project.
Finally, part IV provides a fact file of arts in health research and practice, showing how the arts can be applied and the benefits they can bring across a range of medical disciplines. The book will be valuable for researchers, practitioners, healthcare professionals and those interested in learning more about the field." />
