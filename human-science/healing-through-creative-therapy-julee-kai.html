  <title>Healing Through Creative Therapy - Julee Kai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout this book experience how one feels so alone during periods of struggling with abandonment, neglect, denial, pain, shame, guilt, self-hatred, no sense of self, dissociation, suicide ideology, among others. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;All types of abuse; verbal, physical, sexual, and psychological/emotional; through acts of bullying, ridicule, bias actions, violence, etc.; can bestow inadequate feelings onto the victim of any age, race, sexual preference, religion, or nationality. &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;These illustrations and text came out through my hands, at times even my left hand, and mostly throughout the night as I kept a pad and pencil on the floor next to my bed. It was during times of memories too painful to speak of that these were released from me. I would bring these with me to therapy, hand them to my therapist, and then we slowly spoke of them. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;I assure you this was a tremendous, powerful tool that helped me to move through difficult issues. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Many times mental health treatment was and is unheard of or not available at all. People did what they had to do with the resources at hand. Often, this was/is denial and survival. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that these illustrations and text are not to incriminate anyone. It is to help those abused connect to feelings they are presently experiencing. &lt;/p&gt;" />
