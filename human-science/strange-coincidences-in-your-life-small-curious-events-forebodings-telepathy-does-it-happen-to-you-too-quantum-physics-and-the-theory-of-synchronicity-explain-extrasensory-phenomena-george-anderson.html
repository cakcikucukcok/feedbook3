  <title>Strange Coincidences in Your Life. Small Curious Events. Forebodings. Telepathy. Does it Happen to You Too? Quantum Physics and the Theory of Synchronicity Explain Extrasensory Phenomena. - George Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="132 pages &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
From the earliest developments of thought, mankind believed that some significant coincidences were signs by which a higher philosophical or divine level sought to inter-dialogue with men.&lt;br /&gt;
In the last three centuries this had been erased from the new directions of science. Extraordinary coincidences were considered as fruits of chance. Anyone who wanted to interpret extraordinary events as divine signals was mocked. In the same way, premonitions were considered illusions or even signs of imbalance. This, despite many had experienced these extraordinary facts.&lt;br /&gt;
Science denied the existence of a psychic dimension with which the human mind could interact. According to the common opinion, the only existing reality was matter. However, in the 1980s, experiments in quantum physics demonstrated the existence of a universe that is not just composed of matter. This universe holds a level in which energy and information do not suffer the limits of space and time typical of classical physics.&lt;br /&gt;
This confirms all the intuitions matured in the history of humanity. Among these intuitions the concept of &amp;quot;Soul of the World&amp;quot; enunciated by the Greek philosopher Plato. More recently, the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung has elaborated the theory of the &amp;quot;collective unconscious&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
This book avoids investigating excessively specialized topics. The author clearly accompanies the reader in understanding the three levels that form a single reality.&lt;br /&gt;
The first level is the physical one, which is part of our daily experience. The second level is the one described by quantum physics, typical of the smallest elementary particles of atoms.&lt;br /&gt;
The third is the psychic level called &amp;quot;non-locality&amp;quot;. It is the spiritual level, which can not be physically located anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
This path of knowledge refers to recent discoveries recognized by official science. The strange coincidences and phenomena of the mind become important parts of a new and surprising reality." />
