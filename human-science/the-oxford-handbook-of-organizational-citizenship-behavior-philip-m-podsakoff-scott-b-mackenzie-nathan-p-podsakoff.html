  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Organizational Citizenship Behavior - Philip M. Podsakoff, Scott B. MacKenzie, Nathan P. Podsakoff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Organizational Citizenship Behavior&lt;/em&gt; provides a broad and interdisciplinary review of state-of-the-art research on organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs), and related constructs such as contextual performance, spontaneous organizational behavior, prosocial behavior, and proactive behavior in the workplace. Contributors address the conceptualization and measurement of OCBs; the antecedents, correlates, and consequences of these behaviors; and the methodological issues that are common when studying OCBs. In addition, this handbook pushes future scholarship in this and related areas by identifying substantive questions, methods, and issues for future research. The result is a single resource that will inform and inspire scholars, students, and practitioners of the origins of this construct, the current state of research on this topic, and potentially exciting avenues for future exploration.
This handbook is designed to meet the needs of a broad spectrum of researchers and advanced undergraduate and graduate students in a variety of disciplines including management, organizational behavior, human resources management, and industrial and organizational psychology, as well as those interested in studying citizenship behavior in a variety of organizational contexts including marketing, nursing, engineering, sports, and education." />
