  <title>Conversations with Enrique Dussel on Anti-Cartesian Decoloniality &amp; Pluriversal Transmodernity - Mohammad H. Tamdgidi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This Fall 2013 (XI, 1) issue of &lt;em&gt;Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, is entitled and dedicated to &amp;quot;Conversations with Enrique Dussel on Anti-Cartesian Decoloniality and Pluriversal Transmodernity.&amp;quot; Despite the long established recognition and reputation of Dussel as the most prolific, creative, and influential living Latin American philosopher, a limited portion of his writings has hitherto appeared in English. Exiled to Mexico from his native Argentina more than 35 years ago, Dussel has written more than 70 books and hundreds of articles ranging from theology to history, from philosophy to politics. Increasing interest in his work has been emerging among students and educators interested in developing liberating social theories and philosophies from the Global South. The present volume is one emerging response among many to Dussel&amp;#39;s call for a &amp;quot;South-South Philosophical Dialogue&amp;quot; in order to advance the cause of decolonization and liberation of inner and global human realities. Contributors include: Enrique Dussel, Eduardo Mendieta, Oscar Guardiola-Rivera, Linda Mart&amp;iacute;n Alcoff, Lewis R. Gordon, Ram&amp;oacute;n Grosfoguel (also as journal issue guest editor), Dustin Craun, Rehnuma Sazzad (including both her article and her review of the book of poetry by the Palestinian-American poet Lisa Suhair Majaj), Linda Weber, George Ciccariello-Maher (as journal issue guest editor), and Mohammad H. Tamdgidi (also as journal editor-in-chief). Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-Knowledge is a publication of OKCIR: The Omar Khayyam Center for Integrative Research in Utopia, Mysticism, and Science (Utopystics).
