  <title>The Principles of Psychology (Volume 1 of 2) - Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henry James (1843-1916) was an America-born English writer whose novels, short stories and letters established the foundation of the modernist movement in twentieth century fiction and poetry. His career, one of the most significant and influential in English literature, spanned over five decades and resulted in a body of work that has had a profound impact on generations of writers. Born in New York, but educated in France, Germany, England and Switzerland, James often explored the cultural discord between the Old World (Europe) and the New World (United States) in his writings. Included in this first volume of &quot;The Complete Tales of Henry James&quot; are the earliest published writings from the author beginning with &quot;A Tragedy of Error,&quot; published in 1864. Also included in this volume: &quot;The Story of a Year,&quot; &quot;A Landscape-Painter,&quot; &quot;A Day of Days,&quot; &quot;My Friend Bingham,&quot; &quot;Poor Richard,&quot; &quot;The Story of a Masterpiece,&quot; &quot;The Romance of a Certain Old Clothes,&quot; &quot;A Most Extraordinary Case,&quot; &quot;A Problem,&quot; and &quot;De Grey: A Romance&quot;." />
