  <title>Handwriting Brain Body DisConnect - Cheri L Dotterer, William Houlette, Bethany Peat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;School is tough enough when you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; how to write. Imagine being one of the 33% of students who struggle with writing letters and numbers.&amp;nbsp; This inability or difficulty is called dysgraphia. Children who suffer from dysgraphia often earn the reputation of being lazy or dumb. However, these children, like all children, want to succeed. They do not need to live lives of frustration and anxiety and a constant feeling of failing the adults they respect.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;For over a decade, Cheri Dotterer has observed children with these challenges in school systems across the world. She witnessed their struggle with not only writing but also the challenging behaviors due to their feelings of defeat from the frustration.&amp;nbsp; While experiencing writing challenges as a child and becoming a professional in occupational therapy with a specialty in dysgraphia, Cheri has discovered a process to&amp;nbsp;reduce the anxiety and frustration in children and build up their&amp;nbsp;confidence and competence while writing. In this book, you will discover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How the brain and body work together to create neural pathways for learning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How different environmental features interfere with learning&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to incorporate movement strategies into teaching both spelling and vocabulary in the regular education classroom&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How to discuss goals, accommodations, and modifications for special education Individualized Education Programs (IEP) or 504 plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliminate stress today by including these adaptive techniques into your classroom and home today!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
