  <title>Succeeding by the Wings of God - Harrison I. Enudi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Human wisdom is failing virtually in almost every area of life (because it is limited); thereby, leaving doubts in the minds of people. It has left undeniable traces of economic crashes, political malfunctioning, industrial dilapidations, national and international conflicts, unpredicted disasters, the struggles of individual and cooperate bodies or organizations, the decadence of human health worldwide without a lasting solution, and streams of doubt in human philosophies and ideologies.
You need divine guidance, if you must succeed in this mysterious world. Investors have missed it so many times. Huge amount of money have been lost to several foolish steps. The future of so many families is at stake now because of concurrent economic crises. So many great businesses have gone down the drain because men have neglected the creator of heaven and earth for the pursuit of human ideologies.
Until you embrace the different dimensions of Gods practical secrets (Ways) for true success, you will remain a byword; struggling to break away from the yoke of unproductive life or the cycle of failure, or you will only achieve the measure of success that human energy can reach. 
There are no other short cuts to having a sweatless success other than walking in Gods ways (Principles). Therefore, this very book in your hand is specifically loaded with divine secrets for true success in life and endeavors revealed to Harrison Enudi by God to teach humanity. You are so lucky to have a copy today. You cannot go beyond the limit of the natural sphere except by climbing on the wings of our &#39;Mother-Eagle&#39;- God. No scientist has ever tried it once in this life; not even NASA with all their wealth of scientific knowledge can do that. 
As you read this book, I see you on your way to sweatless success financially from today!" />
