  <title>The Courage to Write - Ralph Keyes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Courage to Write&lt;/i&gt; is an invaluable book and essential reading for anyone who wishes to learn how to write well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Katherine Anne Porter called courage &quot;the first essential&quot; for a writer. &quot;I have to talk myself into bravery with every sentence,&quot; agreed Cynthia Ozick, &quot;sometimes every syllable.&quot; E. B. White said he admired anyone who &quot;has the guts to write anything at all.&quot;An author who has taught writing for more than thirty years,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Courage to Write&lt;/i&gt;, Ralph Keyes, an author who has taught writing for more than thirty years, assures us that anxiety is felt by writers at every level, especially when they dare to do their best. He describes the sequence of &quot;courage points&quot; through which all writers must pass, from the challenge of identifying a worthwhile project to the mixture of pride and panic they feel when examining a newly published book or article. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keyes also offers specifics on how to root out dread of public &quot;performance&quot; and of the judgment of family and friends, make the best use of writers&#39; workshops and conferences, and handle criticism of works in progress. Throughout, he includes the comments of many accomplished writers -- Pat Conroy, Amy Tan, Rita Dove, Isabel Allende, and others -- on how they transcended their own fears to produce great works.&lt;/p&gt;" />
