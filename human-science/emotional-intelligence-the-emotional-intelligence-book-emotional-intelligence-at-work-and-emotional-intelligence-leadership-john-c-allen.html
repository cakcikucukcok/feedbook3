  <title>Emotional Intelligence: The Emotional Intelligence Book -- Emotional Intelligence at Work and Emotional Intelligence Leadership - John C. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emotional Intelligence: The Emotional Intelligence Book -- Emotional Intelligence at Work and Emotional Intelligence Leadership This Emotional Intelligence Book will answer the question: what is emotional intelligence (also referred to as EI.) As the book works to define emotional intelligence through the four main branches, it dives deeper into explaining each branch in hopes of bringing about a higher self-awareness in the reader. Most people walk around with low emotional intelligence out of ignorance. They do not know because they have never been taught. Some crowds believe that the emotionally intelligent are as smart as those with high IQ&#39;s. People in positions of leadership show a higher aptitude of EI for being able to help others, to calm the crowd and to work well under pressure without cracking. Each of the four branches of the emotional intelligence theory is explained in full detail. The first branch is emotional perception. The second branch is emotional reasoning." />
