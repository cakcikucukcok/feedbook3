  <title>The Tao and the Engram - Charles Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are we more than the collection of our memories? Does our behavior reflect more than reaction to accumulated experience?  Or, can our actions be treated as the simple functioning of a neural-state device? Questions such as these continue to puzzle philosophers and scientists.  And although the answers continue to elude inquiry, alternative approaches are available.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Tao and The Engram&lt;/i&gt; brings together a collection of work designed to answer an entertaining question. The engram is a theoretical construct describing the biological storage site for memories. It is currently believed that different types of memories are stored in vastly different locations in the brain. So, what if we were able to separate emotional memory from logical memory? Motor memory from cognitive memory? Will the individual be more than the sum of the parts?  Join in and discover an amazing odyssey of self-discovery...one that you will never forget." />
