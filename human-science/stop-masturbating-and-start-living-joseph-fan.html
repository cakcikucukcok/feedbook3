  <title>Stop Masturbating and Start Living - Joseph Fan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How to finally stop masturbating (and overcome any vice or addiction) and harness the power to reclaim your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been a chronic masturbator for most of my life. As I did the math on how much time I&amp;#39;ve spent masturbating, I surprised even myself. Almost an entire year of my life down the drain... or into a wad of tissues. Masturbation controlled my life and made me into someone I did not like. But then I discovered the secret that helped me take back my life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are now in possession of that secret! This is the only book you&amp;#39;ll need to stop doing the things you don&amp;#39;t want to do anymore and to start living powerfully! The simple truth to stopping masturbation, or any vice, lies in overcoming our biggest antagonists - ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stop Masturbating and Start Living&lt;/em&gt; was designed to be read in the amount of time it takes to masturbate. This book provides a guilt-free way to stop masturbating and overcome any vice or addiction so you can focus that time and energy toward things that matter in your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;www.StopMasturbatingandStartLiving.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
