  <title>Writer Tells All - Robert Masello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A witty and candid firsthand account -- for writers by a writer -- on how to write, sell, publish, and promote a book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This invaluable book is written by a working writer -- not a professor, not a publisher, not an editor, not an agent. Robert Masello is a writer who speaks his mind with absolute candor on everything aspiring book authors need to know. He explains the publishing process step by step -what to expect, how it works, and what authors can do at each point to keep things going smoothly. Equally important, Masello has a lot of fun doing it. His book is filled with sometimes hilarious anecdotes from his own experiences in the trenches of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writer Tells All covers many topics along the way, both large and small, including the things every writer needs to know: choosing a book topic (fiction or nonfiction), writing the proposal, selecting an agent, understanding book contracts, finding an editor, losing an editor, following the production process from manuscript to bound book, using your own savvy and contacts to maximize the effect of marketing, and publicizing the finished product.&lt;/p&gt;" />
