  <title>The Tragedy of Almightiness: Revaluing Ethical Life - Sybe Schaap</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Tragedy of Almightiness encircles the theme of human yearning for omnipotence, as expressed in religion and various ideologies. The central question revolves around the matter of what--in pursuing such an extreme power of the will--man seeks to achieve. While exploring the question, a thought-provoking link is made between religion and atheism; between the Biblical longing for God&#39;s promise and the Marxist appeal for man to realize that same promise. Omnipotence must vouch for the fulfilling of the promise, for justice and for man&#39;s dream of redemption.  However that is not where it ends. The longing for salvation turns out to have a dangerous reverse side to it because it encourages a turning away from the actual world and the all-pervading evil. Omnipotence also facilitates the avenging of such evil. History has shown what this kind of yearning can lead to. The book demonstrates how modernity translates Biblical longings into ideologically justified revengefulness. The description of this process leads to a plea for renewed ethical purpose in life. It is a challenge that also extends to religion. Hence the reason that it is necessary to depart from the idea of omnipotence." />
