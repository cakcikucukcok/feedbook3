  <title>The Book of Djehuti - José Miguel Báez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I, Jos Miguel Bez, an esoteric, apocryphal, philosophical and Kabbalist writer with a College degree in Anthropology from Lehman College brings you the English version of the book, La Filosofa Del Libro De Hermes Mercurio Trismegisto under its English name, The Book of Djehuti and I am also known in Face Book as, Al-Adn Mikael Ben HaKadosh.
	In my last literary work, I bring you the ancient philosophy of the magical prayers and rituals of the hermetic philosophy of the wisest and most powerful sacred scribe, high priest, magician, hierophant adept and seer of the ancient Egyptians, which I am as the spiritual and psychical Nefer-Ka-Ptah The Perfect Spirit (Ka) of Ptah G-d who stole the Argha of Thot, the Blessings of Ishrael and the philosophy of the infrastructure of a single and global government, banking and monetary system for the benefit of humanity.
I would like for every man and woman of the modern world to be able to read, analyze and comprehend my last literary work and its philosophy as the godson of Thoth and Maat, which has become the spiritual embodiment of the Argha of Thoth and reveals the most powerful science of them all since I am the most powerful magician, sacred scribe and high priest of the ancient Sumerians, Hebrews, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Persians, Babylonians, Greeks, Romans, Celts, Germanic peoples and the Asians.
I am Thoth and Nefer-Ka-Ptah Imhotep, the one who is the decipherer and the knower of the mysteries of the androgynous G-d within the infinitude of space-time and eternity and its divine and immutable laws and wisdom, the Nahash Baqir, who opens the divine Torat and understands its Kabbalah." />
