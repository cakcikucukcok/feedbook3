  <title>Equipping Quality Youth Development Professionals - William B. Kearney, William H. Quinn, Robert J. Barcelona</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Whether you are a seasonal volunteer, group leader or full-time professional, you need practical advice on how to provide young people with the tools they need to succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equipping Quality Youth Development ProfessionalsE-QYP for shortprovides best practices to help young people ages six to eighteen reach their potential. It also offers age-appropriate ideas that you can translate to your specific child and youth program.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;E-QYP is a handy reference for individuals, as well as a powerful volunteer and staff development tool when adopted by organizations. It also serves as a great supplement to college textbooks on child and youth development. With easy-to-read information and sample activities that really work, this guide can help you help the young people in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Youth agencies serve huge numbers of kids in the United States, but few youth workers have specific knowledge about youth development, and agency budgets tend to have few dollars for staff training. Although the training and credentialing of all youth workers remains an aspiration, workers with and without training need ready access to research-based knowledge and practices. Equipping Quality Youth Development Professionals provides both. Whether read as a whole or accessed for just-in-time information, Equipping Quality Youth Development Professionals is a timely, valuable, and much-needed resource.&lt;/p&gt;
