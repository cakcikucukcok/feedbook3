  <title>50 Rules for Sons - Tim Hoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written for his son upon graduation from high school, Tim Hoch&#39;s 50 Rules for Sons is an inspiring gift book that shares a father&#39;s wisdom with sons who are leaving the nest.  Lessons like: Be open to and unashamed of the possibility that you might be wrong. Take stock of where you&#39;ve been, but don&#39;t dwell on it. If you show up to class on time and sit in one of the first three rows, you will succeed.  In the first half of the book, the 50 rules are listed quickly, independent of any explanation-a format that appeals to the younger, 140-character generation. At the end, Tim gives the back story to each rule, explaining his personal life experience that makes the rule so relevant.   Taken from a lifetime of both failure and success, Tim&#39;s words are powerful tools to help sons of all ages and backgrounds grow and mature into their best." />
