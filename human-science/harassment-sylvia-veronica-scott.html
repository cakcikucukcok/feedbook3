  <title>Harassment - Sylvia Veronica Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, HARASSMENT: VICTIMS AND THEIR VICTIMIZERS, will attempt to expose the truth about the sources and reasons for the preponderance of sexual harassment in the workplace and academia. Harassment is a pervasive social problem directed mostly toward females of all ages and races by males of all races. The underlying causes of harassment are sexism and sexism-racism that have been established in this patriarchal society as the norm for the behavior of males. This norm is not normal; rather, it is a type of psychopathologic behavior that is dangerous. Actually, these occurrences may border on fascism within a democratic and liberal society. The male entitlement theory, manhood theory and the masculine mystique all contribute to the harassment of women because males believe that they have a right to control females with physical and /or psychological violence. The reasons why women are victims will be followed by why men victimize women. Both chapters will cover the assessments relevant to the problems both women and men face in this Western culture due to our socialization practices. Men are not cognizant of the scope of their behavior; women are not often certain about how to handle difficult situations with men in the workplace and academia. Some women may be becoming too complacent and will accept abuse; while, others will in turn become aggressors toward other women and then with men in relationships." />
