  <title>Bipolar by Koehler: And Other Writings - John L. Koehler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bipolar by Koehler is about a man who never gave up.&lt;/strong&gt; John Koehler is a uniquely gifted man who was humbled at the age of thirty by seasonal depression and bipolar syndrome. The story elaborates John&amp;rsquo;s frustration as well as his tenacity for solving his own equation. How he relied on his wife and friends, his doctors, medication and his God to help him deal with the issues and fears in his life. For those that suffer like John, this book offers guidance and wisdom so that you too can live life large and in control.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Dear Lord is a great letter writing campaign that John has with God. Taking the cue of David&amp;#39;s complete and utter honesty in the Psalms, Koehler pours out his heart when he is flying with the angels and when he is in the desert, cut off and fighting off the demons.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Road to Capernaum is John&amp;rsquo;s answered prayer.&amp;nbsp; It tells how John got caught up with kids with disabilities in a ministry called Young Life Capernaum. And how he used the gift of his own disability to connect with special people and teach them that they belong to God as much as anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;" />
