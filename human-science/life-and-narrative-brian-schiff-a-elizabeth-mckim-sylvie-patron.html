  <title>Life and Narrative - Brian Schiff, A. Elizabeth McKim, Sylvie Patron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The challenge of life and literary narrative is the central and perennial mystery of how people encounter, manage, and inhabit a self and a world of their own - and others&#39; - creations. With a nod to the eminent scholar and psychologist Jerome Bruner, &lt;em&gt;Life and Narrative: The Risks and Responsibilities of Storying Experience&lt;/em&gt; explores the circulation of meaning between experience and the recounting of that experience to others.
A variety of arguments center around the kind of relationship life and narrative share with one another. In this volume, rather than choosing to argue that this relationship is either continuous or discontinuous, editors Brian Schiff, A. Elizabeth McKim, and Sylvie Patron and their contributing authors reject the simple binary and masterfully incorporate a more nuanced approach that has more descriptive appeal and theoretical traction for readers.
Exploring such diverse and fascinating topics as &#39;Narrative and the Law,&#39; &#39;Narrative Fiction, the Short Story, and Life,&#39; &#39;The Body as Biography,&#39; and &#39;The Politics of Memory,&#39;&lt;em&gt; Life and Narrative&lt;/em&gt; features important research and perspectives from both up-and-coming researchers and prominent scholars in the field - many of which who are widely acknowledged for moving the needle forward on the study of narrative in their respective disciplines and beyond." />
