  <title>Soul Talk - Robert E. A. Daley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1976 (the US Bi-Centennial year), when I first began seriously looking at Americas collection of state and national symbols, it felt like I was peeking into the nations dream-journalbecause symbols are the language of the soul and talk to us on that level.  Symbols are the language that the soul uses to communicate with our consciousness. It happens every night in our dream-time. Politically, we use symbols to memorialize ideals and events for posterity and in elementary school we were taught what our political symbols mean on the superficial level. But what do these symbols say to us on the deeper, metaphysical level? Our Federal &amp; State symbols were established through deep soul-searching by our elected legislators, so they have the quality of dream-symbols. Collectively, they are the Nations dream-journal. Is there a cohesive message within them? If so, it was fostered over a span of many centuries from a level of reality beyond our ownby the powers that inspired everyone from Columbus to the current voting-block of American citizens. This book is a reading of their collective conversation." />
