  <title>Kant on Evil, Self-Deception, and Moral Reform - Laura Papish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout his writings, and particularly in &lt;em&gt;Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Kant alludes to the idea that evil is connected to self-deceit, and while numerous commentators regard this as a highly attractive thesis, none have seriously explored it. Laura Papish&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Kant on Evil, Self-Deception, and Moral Reform&lt;/em&gt; addresses this crucial element of Kant&#39;s ethical theory.
Working with both Kant&#39;s core texts on ethics and materials less often cited within scholarship on Kant&#39;s practical philosophy (such as Kant&#39;s logic lectures), Papish explores the cognitive dimensions of Kant&#39;s accounts of evil and moral reform while engaging the most influential -- and often scathing -- of Kant&#39;s critics.  Her book asks what self-deception is for Kant, why and how it is connected to evil, and how we achieve the self-knowledge that should take the place of self-deceit.  She offers novel defenses of Kant&#39;s widely dismissed claims that evil is motivated by self-love and that an evil is rooted universally in human nature, and she develops original arguments concerning how social institutions and interpersonal relationships facilitate, for Kant, the self-knowledge that is essential to moral reform.
In developing and defending Kant&#39;s understanding of evil, moral reform, and their cognitive underpinnings, Papish not only makes an important contribution to Kant scholarship.  &lt;em&gt;Kant on Evil, Self-Deception, and Moral Reform&lt;/em&gt; also reveals how much contemporary moral philosophers, philosophers of religion, and general readers interested in the phenomenon of evil stand to gain by taking seriously Kant&#39;s views." />
