  <title>Tagger - Mary A. Monroe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I love using Reader&#39;s Theatre in my classroom,&quot; . . . &quot;When will they make a movie out of your books?&quot; . . . &quot;I love performing arts!&quot; Comments such as these from loyal fans and teachers motivated Mary A. Monroe to write a Theatre/Screenplay version of her popular teen novel, Tagger. Now Luis and his friends, including The Beast, Grill, Loco, Catfish, The Princess and more, come to life in this easy-to-read and easy-to-act-out version of the original novel. 
     Tagger is the story of Freshman Luis Arteaga, 14, who can&#39;t stay awake in class at Sunrise High School because he&#39;s up most nights until early morning working on graffiti drawings for his Black Book.
Once Luis teams up with a crew called Skillz, headed by The Beast and Grill, his life gets more and more out of control until he&#39;s forced to move to his dad&#39;s home in a small midwestern river town called Cave-in-Rock, rich in mystery and heritage. Luis feels he is being called to the cave to do something -- but what? This is Luis&#39; fascinating play, inspired by true events. 
     Now theatre students in middle and high schools can share this exciting story with viewers across America. As well, since Cave-in-Rock has been the unforgettable setting for major motion pictures in the past such as &quot;How the West Was Won,&quot; isn&#39;t it time for a new hit teen motion picture -- Tagger -- to premiere in film? 
The undeniable answer is &quot;Yes!&quot;" />
