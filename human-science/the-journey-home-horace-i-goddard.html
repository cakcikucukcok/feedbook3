  <title>The Journey Home - Horace I. Goddard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Calluses, calabash-big, are on my feet.
Sugar in my veins sweetens my life.
Salt preserves my flesh in this unrefrigerated land.
I am woman
Woe I am.
Ise woman.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In this mythical-poetic collection of verse, seasoned poet Horace Goddard shares vivid imagery and energetic language as he offers a bold, refreshing, yet introspective glimpse into an African Caribbean mans search for a home in the diaspora.&lt;p&gt;
As migratory man travels from place to place and establishes ties to the land, he nurtures a perpetual yearning for the land of his origin and often wonders, Where is home and how will I get there? In this new collection of poems, often penned in fable-like style, Goddard questions what home means, what culture means when a person is transplanted, and what race means in a country that is predominantly black or white.&lt;p&gt;
As Goddard offers a memorable lyrical journey from Africa to the Caribbean and finally to Canada, his poetry invokes emotions and
nostalgia as he explores the differences in cultures and details his experiences as a traveler. It is through this celebrated poets eyes
that many will truly understand what it is like to journey home." />
