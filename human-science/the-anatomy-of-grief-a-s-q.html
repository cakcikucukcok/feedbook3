  <title>The Anatomy of Grief - A.S.Q.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-hansi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes&quot;&gt;The book deals with the cosmos of grief taking it as a separate subject that is studied through its cross section after segmentalization. It is done by discussing the human state of affairs that generates tragedy at common levels. This exploration is achieved by devising new terminologies and expressions. Meanwhile the terms of some other subjects like science, arts and music have also been moulded to leave new meanings. The discussion on each of the terms varies in detail so whoever reads it may find a sense of association to some sort of similar grief existing in one&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes; mso-ascii-font-family: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-fareast-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-hansi-font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA; mso-no-proof: yes&quot;&gt;s life. The blend of realistic, surrealistic and abstract ideas would invite the reader to think over the serious concerns that somehow damage the soul. The working of heart, mind, intentions and actions has been analysed. The reader would observe an effort done for revealing the mechanism of subconsciousness but without setting anyone a hero or a villain. Man is criticised for some aspects related to the shades of social, ethical interpersonal and to some extent religious practices. Aristotle once suggested that tragedy is possible without characters but not without action. This book coincidentally tries to achieve this because actions are found as characters causing tragedy simultaneously arousing pity and fear. As the name suggests the subject of grief has been dissected for an examination through autopsy. The book resembles a dictionary in its presentation for the conduction of concepts but without respecting the order of the entries.&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
