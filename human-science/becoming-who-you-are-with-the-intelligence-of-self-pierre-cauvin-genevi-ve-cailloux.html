  <title>Becoming Who You Are with the Intelligence of Self - Pierre Cauvin, Geneviève Cailloux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The intelligence of Self (TIOS) offers a new, dynamic and effective approach to personal development.  Designed to offer readers the opportunity to use a refined typological tool to learn their current default position on their psychological roadmap, and consciously integrate disowned or undeveloped aspects of their personality, creating internal balance, peace harmony and joy for their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach enables us to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;get a snapshot of the map of our existing psyche.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;better understand our routine habits and truly get to know ourselves&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;discover what lies hidden within each of us and integrate our disowned parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;develop our ability to recognize and embrace our internal opposites and to manage paradox without feeling unduly stressed &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;make better choices going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;live our life fully at each of its different phases.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;establish and maintain better relationships with ourselves and others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether undertaken in a self-coaching format, by an individual or used by human resources professionals, consultants, coaches, or therapists  this approach has proven to be effective, powerful and rewarding for individuals and corporations alike.. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case studies enclosed and the many illustrations will enable you to benefit rapidly by recognizing and developing your own strengths grounded in a solid Intelligence of Self and Others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011 the authors received in San Francisco the Mary McCaulley Lifetime Achievement Award&quot;, which recognizes individuals who have made a significant contribution in encouraging the constructive use of differences identified by psychological type. In 2012, the training process for consultants, using the TIOS approach, was awarded the European Quality Award from the European Mentoring and Coaching Council.&lt;/p&gt;" />
