  <title>The Akshaya Patra Series Manasa Bhajare: Worship in the Mind Part One - Signet Il Y’ Viavia: Daniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Akshaya Patra series is written as a book to augment books of philosophical inquiry; and to assist true inquiry in such a way, so as to inspire the Mysteries that unfold on the path of initiation. Let us begin by breaking bread together, by this first step, that we may destroy the tome of ignorance with that first principle in prayer saying; A house that is loved is always satisfied. 
This house is the Temple of Self; inspired by life and the touch of nature, the Akshaya Patra throughout is filled with inner depth and determination. These first works of the Akshaya Patra, were inspired by, and dedicated to, Bhagavan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, whose influence was, and still is, too vast for words; and whose love has satisfied the genius in this Tomb and Tome of Time. 
This first book of Volume ONE, here printed in color as Volume ONE Book ONE Part ONE begins, with the features of introductory, for taking the earliest footsteps, on the path of sacred life; dedicated to Self-Transformation. 
As a Tree of Knowledge is planted, its roots fan out thru many traditions, and its branches stretch to provide shelter and protection over all. Its leaves call for all to come and take their share of comfort beneath the shadows in its shade; delighted and lighted by the sun by day, and with night fascinated to discover the ringlets of the moon and stars that gave first light in the residence of space. We are THAT Time, we are that Space; we are that Consciousness. Tat Twam Asi the pursuant in pursuant search, in the sea, of supreme reality. 
Self- Mastery is a personal journey and there is only one friend; and that is the sacred messenger, who comes to life as the resident within. 
There are many years involved in coming to this writing of the Akshaya Patra Series. The examinations here have taken us to this first place in the writing; that is nothing more than the satisfaction of ethical journey, working forward from the true beginning. There are many more volumes and books to follow for us, in order to reach our destination in this vast work of self-transformation. 
Are we ready? Are we deserving? We have been fooled by fools maybe, and we are, or are we, the fools to dream that we are more than this fool we have come to be. We come to this knowing that we have not come to terms with our true identity. Maybe we have fed ourselves unwisely, and only broken bread that is dry, tasteless, and come unsatisfied, from drink before a shallow empty well. 
The Akshaya Patra Volume ONE Book ONE; entitled Manasa Bhajare: Worship in the Mind; means to satisfy. The Mind will be the first portal passed; before transitioning thru its own death and resurrection. 
It is here in this first book of Volume ONE that we are first entertained; breaking down our traditions that take shape into something immaterial but tangible. 
In all, Volume ONE alone will consist of nine books. More to be published. This is Book ONE. This color edition is Part ONE of three Parts. 
Seven Volumes are written and every day these are maturing waiting for release. Currently there are hiding behind this Volume ONE Book ONE about 17 books written It is to unfold the culmination of a lifetime of work. Each Volume evolves thru seven stages of Initiation; as if passing thru seven days labor on the path towards liberation. In this it is like the Bhagavata. 
Our purpose, objective and ends may be summed up in the advice given in these words of Sai Baba: 
(True knowledge) instructs you to reform yourself first. After transforming yourself, try to reform others. That is the advice offered by Vidya (True Knowledge). The delusive attachment to the objective world can be uprooted by means of selfless service rendered as worship to the Lord. Genuine devotion is characterized by LOVE FOR ALL, at all times, everywhere. - Sai Baba" />
