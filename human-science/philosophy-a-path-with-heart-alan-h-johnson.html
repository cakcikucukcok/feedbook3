  <title>Philosophy: a Path with Heart - Alan H. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Philosophy: A Path with Heart is an autobiographically structured story of the authors deeply personal, emotional, and engaging encounter with philosophy, psychology, and spiritual concerns of the mind and heart from the age of thirteen. Significantly more attention is paid to philosophy than biography. The reader is asked to consider the philosophical, moral, political, environmental, and spiritual issues on which the author has reflected, and with which he continues to dance. 
	He cites in some detail the writings of Barry, Halifax, Harner, Illich, Jung, Kluckhohn, Marx, Parsons, Safina, Swimme, Shills, Tillich, and Wilber. The book attempts to inspire an appreciation of philosophy as an ongoing dialogue with ones self and others. This dialogue is how his or her world is created, and directly responsible for forming the physical, social, and personal space in which they live. 
	Philosophy is asking more of oneself than facile play with a Smartphone. Philosophy is creating a home for the soul as a house is constructed as a home for the body. What are you building for yourself and those around you?" />
