  <title>BUDDHA&#39;S FAVOURITE WORDS - Bruno Nua</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BUDDHA&amp;rsquo;S FAVOURITE WORDS &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;is a unique collection of all the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s main teachings in one volume offered with insight, clarity and occasional humour. It is presented in an A-to-Z format as if the Buddha were alive today and these were his favourite keywords for unlocking the essence of the entire path to Awakening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reader is encouraged to approach this book slowly and mindfully. Reading and reflecting on a single entry per day, one could spaciously receive and explore the Buddha&amp;rsquo;s Wisdom in less than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each &lt;em&gt;Favourite Word &lt;/em&gt;unfolds sequentially as a clear, illuminating contemplation intended to spark a fire in the heart-mind of the reader. This collection comes from the pen of a Buddhist philosopher who has spent the last thirty years receiving these teachings from some of the most inspiring Asian masters to bring Buddhism to the West.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The result is also the fruition of decades of the author&amp;rsquo;s lectures on Buddhism in universities in Europe and Asia as well as presenting the teachings within Buddhist communities themselves. It will be of special interest to students and seekers alike, particularly those completely new to Buddhism or who find themselves at that &amp;lsquo;intermediate&amp;rsquo; stage where clarity and focus can seem all too elusive and rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;BRUNO NUA &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;is a Buddhist Philosopher from Ireland where he had a humble upbringing in one of Dublin&amp;rsquo;s roughest suburbs. Graduating from Trinity College with a Masters degree he became a teacher, first in the country&amp;rsquo;s most privileged private school and then in the country&amp;rsquo;s most disadvantaged one. A lifelong love of meditation and spirituality eventually brought him to Buddhism. Having a deep affinity for the Tibetan and Zen traditions, Bruno connected almost straight away with three of the finest Buddhist masters of the age. He first became a student of Sogyal Rinpoche, which also led him to Thich Nhat Hanh and Ringu Tulku Rinpoche. Some years later Bruno became a university lecturer in Buddhist Philosophy, which took him from Dublin to Bangkok [and back again]. He brought Irish Buddhists together when he formed &lt;em&gt;Buddhist Network Ireland&lt;/em&gt;, and represented them on the first &lt;em&gt;Irish Inter-Religious Council &lt;/em&gt;alongside the national leaders of the Roman Catholic, Protestant, Muslim and other faiths&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, Bruno lives in Catalunya and Thailand where he says he tries to remain in the here and now, do as little as possible, not think too much, and write a little bit from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
