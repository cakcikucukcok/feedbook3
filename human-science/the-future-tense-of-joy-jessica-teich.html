  <title>The Future Tense of Joy - Jessica Teich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Jessica Teich&#39;s understanding of trauma is the infallible authority upon which her tale rests. But the delicacy and nuance with which she renders this story is that of a poet.&quot; &lt;br&gt;--MERYL STREEP&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jessica Teich was among the first wave of women to expose Hollywood&#39;s culture of harassment and abuse. Her memoir, &lt;i&gt;The Future Tense of Joy&lt;/i&gt;, tells the inspiring story of her own recovery from trauma, empowering other victims to move past silence and shame toward help, healing, and hope. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Teich writes openly, courageously, of the challenges facing so many survivors: to feel safe, to find love, to nurture optimism and resilience, and to reclaim the sense of connection--of belonging--that defines us as human beings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt; called &lt;i&gt;The Future Tense of Joy&lt;/i&gt; &quot;an honest, compassionate memoir about shaking off personal demons.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Library Journal &lt;/i&gt;said, &quot;Teich looks at motherhood, depression, the effect of damaging relationships, and the challenges placed on successful, driven women. She does so with grace and openness, even while exploring painful parts of her past.&quot; (starred review) &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Future Tense of Joy&lt;/i&gt; belongs with classics of the genre-from &lt;i&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt;-that celebrate the triumph of truth-telling and the redeeming power of love. Lyrical, funny and brave, Teich&#39;s book speaks to anyone eager to emerge from the long shadow of betrayal to find love, liberation, and joy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
