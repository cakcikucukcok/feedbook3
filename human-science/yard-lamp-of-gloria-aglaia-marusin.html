  <title>Yard Lamp of Gloria - Aglaia Marusin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Synoptic Anticipation
My five-fold discourse commences with an outback Trek to a somewhat supernatural setting. This preparatory destination, by echelon, anticipates my nicer, statelier but more unendurable big Energy Center; designated as the glorious Glib megalopolis... Then, the reader is catapulted to its enormous counterpart chorus of something so inexpressible, and yet inchoate, as to render yardstick usage of vocabulary inadequate! But not only so- rather- in that the Plot of such outbursts skids to a standstill at the dilated disclosure of a Hypersphere! Accordingly addressed, as it were, a romantic and surreal tale of the personified Divinity- shared by my primitive gliff of Her- follows suit (instantaneously) until to no reservation. And finally- to conclude this Vision- I embark upon an ultimate frontier with that selfsame Hypersphere paramount. 
Precedent to deployment of The Yard Lamp of Gloria storyboard, I noticed interlink of the 1990s at the LILCO, or Long Island Lighting Company with its fine public works of innovative energy distribution along New Yorks industrial peninsula. Therein, I perused the early inception of its very vast framework of infrastructure, and how that the 120 mile long island has reached a zenith of such classical reputation. By this diorama- inter alia- I was able to reconsider well enough the future ramifications of street lighting, and that perhaps for its very own sake... 
As such, imagine a brighter Tomorrow of unparalleled lamp entities designed to energize us into Immortality. Indeed, the cornerstone of which paves parking lots of sacrosanct cessation; or- as shown in yon Yard Lamp of Gloria- some radiant respite to fulfill todays anticipation still! Wherefore, our precarious din of affairs need be altered- drastically- nonetheless, if ever we are to attain the upper rung via Jacobs Ladder! Not an impending clich, I say, but a requisite pioneer spirit for all. Aglaia Marusin
