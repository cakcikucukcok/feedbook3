  <title>How to Grow Kids - Wendy Iscove, Dax Schaffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your children are your world, and they want to be happy and emotionally strong. You, as parents, also wish that for them, but you dont always know how to make it happen. In How to Grow Kids: From the Heart of Andy, author Wendy Iscove shares insight from a childs point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Young Andy tells parents what he needs to grow strong emotionally and socially. He offers practical suggestions for parents to help their kids feel safe and loved and calm inside while developing order and boundaries within their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With full illustrations included, How to Grow Kids helps parents open discussion with their children as they explore and understand their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an invaluable resource for parents and more helpful than any I have used in my professional work with children and their families. The clarity and heartwarming presentation of the essential ingredients parents need to provide their children, is comprehensive and relevant for raising healthy, self-assured children and adolescents.&lt;br /&gt;
 Karen E. Davis, Psy.D. M.F.T., L.E.P. &lt;br /&gt;
 Practicing Child and Adolescent Therapist,&lt;br /&gt;
Educational Psychologist in Beverly Hills, CA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This wonderful book, written from a childs perspective, shows parents, with loving sensitivity, what is needed for a child to grow up feeling secure. Listening to Andys words and seeing him in action make it easy for readers to understand his world and his needs. The clear language provides parents with tools to address these needs. This rare glimpse into a childs world will immeasurably assist parents and all others who work with children.&lt;br /&gt;
