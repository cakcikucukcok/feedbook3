She has trained Seals in martial arts and is also part of a unit that works with Belgian Malinois dogs. Her partner Kane Cullen also works with her unit and the dogs. They are about to embark on a retirement in a secret valley in northwestern Montana. Before they can leave, four of her friends and soon-to-be husbands join them on their adventure. As time goes by, they collect even more people that are interested in living off the grid. Her dad and grandfather have been living that way for many years, and they will join them. They will have many adventures, but they will survive.
