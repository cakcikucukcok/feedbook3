  <title>Death Hunt - James Axler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The treacherous new world of post-nuclear America guarantees no inalienable rights–no promises of freedom, liberty or justice for all. Instead, chaos and bloodlust thrive–but so do the innate strengths of the human spirit, and the virtues of honour and courage.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryan Cawdor has endured the worst that Deathlands has to offer and continues to push on, leading his companions through a land of madness and treachery, seizing each new day with a deep, primal hope that refuses to die….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ryan&#39;s razor-sharp edge has been dulled by the loss of his son, Dean–but grief is an emotion he cannot indulge if the band is to escape the chains of sadistic Baron Ethan. His thriving ville offers a special commodity: blood sport. Now with the group&#39;s armorer, JB Dix, imprisoned and near death, Ryan and the others are forced to join Ethan&#39;s hunt–as the hunted. But the perverse and powerful baron has changed the rules. Skilled in mind control, he ensures the warriors will not be tracked by high-paying thrill-seekers. Instead, they will hunt each other–to the death. In the Deathlands, the odds of survival just got worse….&lt;/p&gt;
