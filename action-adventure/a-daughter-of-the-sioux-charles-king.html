  <title>A Daughter of the Sioux - Charles King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The major commanding looked up from the morning report and surveyed the post adjutant with something of perturbation, if not annoyance, in his grim, gray eyes. For the fourth time that week had Lieutenant Field requested permission to be absent for several hours. The major knew just why the junior wished to go and where. The major knew just why he wished him not to go, but saw fit to name almost any other than the real reason when, with a certain awkward hesitancy he began:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;W&amp;mdash;ell, is the post return ready?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;will&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;be, sir, in abundant time,&amp;quot; was the prompt reply.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know they sent it back for correction last month,&amp;quot; hazarded the commander.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And you know, sir, the error was not mine,&amp;quot; was the instant rejoinder, so quick, sharp and positive as to carry it at a bound to the verge of disrespect, and the keen, blue eyes of the young soldier gazed, frank and fearless, into the heavily ambushed grays of the veteran in the chair. It made the latter wince and stir uneasily.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If there&amp;#39;s one thing I hate, Field, it is to have my papers sent back by some whipsnapper of a clerk, inviting attention to this or that error, and I expect my adjutant to see to it that they don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your adjutant does see to it, sir. I&amp;#39;m willing to bet a month&amp;#39;s pay fewer errors have been found in the papers of Fort Frayne than any post in the Department of the Platte. General Williams told you as much when you were in Omaha.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The major fairly wriggled in his cane-bottomed whirligig. What young Field said was true, and the major knew it. He knew, moreover, there wasn&amp;#39;t a more painstaking post adjutant from the Missouri to the mountains. He knew their monthly reports&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;returns&amp;quot; as the regulations call them&amp;mdash;were referred to by a model adjutant general as model papers. He knew it was due to young Field&amp;#39;s care and attention, and he knew he thought all the world of that young gentleman. It was just because he thought so much of him he was beginning to feel that it was high time to put a stop to something that was going on. But, it was a delicate matter; a woman was the matter; and he hadn&amp;#39;t the moral courage to go at it the straightforward way. He &amp;quot;whip sawed&amp;quot; again. Thrumming on the desk with his lean, bony fingers he began:&amp;mdash;" />
