  <title>The Knights of Emerald 08 : Fallen Gods - Anne Robillard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Knights of Emerald: This epic tale takes place in a forgotten world in a time of great unrest as Amecareth, the Dark Lord of the Insect People, attempts to take over the known universe. It is the story of Kira, the purple child, born of the rape of Queen Fan of Shola by the despicable Emperor, who will ultimately bring about his downfall, and of the brave Knights of Emerald entrusted with her safety. 
Book 8 of the saga The Knights of Emerald, Fallen Gods: Faced with the difficult task of assigning the Squires to their new masters, Wellan soon realizes that there aren&#39;t enough Knights for all of them and that many of the Knights are already training a child. In order to give Wellan a hand, Jenifael, Lassa and Liam use an old spell that greatly disrupts life in the castle.
Under the pretext of going back to his old village, Onyx takes Sutton and his family to the land of their ancestors. But the renegade&#39;s true purpose is to obtain a powerful weapon that the goddess Cinn has hidden in the most southern part of the kingdom.
The Knights who have barely recovered from the unrest caused by the young culprits at the castle are attacked by an enemy dropping from the sky. They soon find out that they are poorly equipped to defend themselves against fallen gods.
At the same time, enemy troops led by Asbeth make their way to the Castle of Emerald adding to chaos." />
