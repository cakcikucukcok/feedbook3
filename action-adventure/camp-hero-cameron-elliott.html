  <title>Camp Hero - Cameron Elliott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a time of war, morality is overcome by the unthinkable. The unthinkable justified by fear and circumstances beyond our control. From uncontrollable circumstances emerges a new world of terror. To fight this terror we sacrifice our morality further and go beyond the unthinkable. The remnants of this vicious cycle turn with a momentum all their own and live on long after the treaties are signed. This is the fuel that sustains us between conflicts. This is the catalyst that ignites our creativity and spawns new technologies of war. We are united through common enemies, even though our greatest enemy is our own fear. 
For David Andrews, his peaceful existence collided with the reverberations of a war written into history books decades earlier. As the reality of these uncontrollable events swamp over him he comes face-to-face with the unthinkable. The cyclone of a war that will not die will test his fear of the unknown by redefining everything he knew to be true and replacing it with an alternate universe. An alternate set of events sent into motion the day of his birth. A universe created by the cold war in a long forgotten US military base called Camp Hero. 
Camp Hero State Park is located on the south fork of Long Island, just west of the Montauk Point Lighthouse. The Montauk Point Lighthouse was commissioned by General George Washington in 1792 during the Revolutionary War.  In 1929, during WWI the US Army established Fort Hero, named after Major General Andrew Hero, Jr. who was the Armys Chief of Coastal Artillery.  In 1942, during WWII the US Army upgraded the defenses of Fort Hero to deal with the growing threat of German invasion and Camp Hero was born.  Camp Hero was eventually turned over to the Air Force in 1950 to become part of the National Air Defense system.  Finally, in 1984 the land was turned over to the New York State Department of Parks.  Conspiracy theorists believe the base is still operational today and the science being developed is out of this world." />
