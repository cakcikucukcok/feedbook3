  <title>A Bow Elk Hunter Nightmare - Clyde G. Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story could very well have happened while hunting elk in Colorado. When I approached two men dressed in street clothes and oxfords. It was strange to see them in 14 inches of fresh snow but there big smiling faces left me to believe every thing was OK. They told me that they had been stuck for four days and I offered to help them out. They apparently had no money to pay for the damaged chains on my vehicle. Later that night I had a terrible dream that they took me prisoner and held me against my will for 72 hours in a poorly constructed 16x20 cabin on Elliot Ridge. The drug runners had a plantation up there, and a clearing big enough to land a helicopter. The last two chapters of the book are fictional, my dream, in thirty years I&#39;ve had a lot of strange and ironic events during elk hunting, but not tragic. But it could have been when 3 men took my bull elk at gun point in 1973. They threatened me to step out of my truck. I did not provoke them, I said that &quot;If I come out it won&#39;t be empty handed&quot;." />
