  <title>Goshawk - Doug McPheters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union disintegrated, David Garvey, a Manhattan international lawyer, built a hugely profitable loan-sharking operation in Russia and nearby countries in Eastern Europe. Davids fund quickly amassed large pools of collateral for high-interest loans  home and apartment mortgages as well as business and personal collateral. Seeing all of these financial instruments as leverage for getting around biting international economic sanctions, the Iraqis looked for ways to steal them from Davids Knigsberg Fund  first by co-opting his syndicate of bank lenders and then by attacking David and his family. Sparked by innovative technology imagined and patented by the author, this fast-moving thriller plays out in the streets and courtrooms of Manhattan and Northern and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRAISE for Goshawk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;A complex international banking thriller that keeps the pages turning.&lt;/br&gt; 
-Tim Green, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Bestselling Author of &lt;i&gt;American Outrage&lt;/i&gt; and pending &lt;i&gt;Unstoppable&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;McPheters has crafted a fast-moving international thriller that skillfully uses new technologies he is inventing in his other life as a well-known Connecticut entrepreneur and guru of holographic technology this is a fun and fast read.&lt;/br&gt;
-Matthew Nemerson, President &amp; CEO Connecticut Technology Council&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Goshawk keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters are richly developed, the story tightly woven  a must for thrill seekers.&lt;/br&gt; 
-Rochelle Carrington, President &amp; CEO Second Wind Advisory Group&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Goshawk soars and dives through the mosaic of international finance and intrigue. This thrillers hero, David Garvey, a wealthy and surprisingly ethical Wall Street lawyer, embarks on a scheme to start a business of lending money to former Eastern Bloc citizens, only to discover he has unseen business partners out to take what he has created. The authors own experience as a Wall Street lawyer and financier guides us expertly above and below the treacherous world of greed, power, and money. In Garveys own words, trust no one but yourself.&lt;/br&gt; 
-Steven B. Beasley, Financial Advisor of a Wall Street firm&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Doug McPheters does a fantastic job of providing the reader with a glimpse of what it would be like to fly a super-advanced airplane; his description of the Goshawks maneuvering capability is very realistic and puts the reader in the cockpit with David Garvey.&lt;/br&gt;
