      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arnab Roy is a brilliant web designer who has been invited to develop the tourism campaign for Odisha, India. To get a feel of the place, Arnab and his wife Anu visit Konark, a quiet beach town in Odisha, known for being home to an ancient piece of architecture called the Temple of the Sun God. Arnab and Anu are enchanted by the grandeur of the sacred place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Sun Temple, Arnab has found his star attraction, the worlds gateway to Odisha. He sets to work straight away, but soon encounters a mystery, discovering strange rocks and ancient coins on a pristine beach near Konark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What follows is a series of bizarre eventsthe death of a professional diver, the appearance of mysterious footage of underwater caverns, and a gruesome attack on a ministry car. Are these events coincidences or signs of a conspiracy? The Temple of the Sun God holds many secrets, and some of those may lie at the bottom of the sea.&lt;/p&gt;" />
