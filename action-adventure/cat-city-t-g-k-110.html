  <title>Cat City - T. G. K. 110</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based off the role-playing game from T. G. K. 110s childhood comes the dark, yet comedic story of anthropomorphic beings known as chimerians; trying to survive in a post-apocalyptic world alongside the human race.
&lt;br&gt;
Many years ago a colossal alien vessel entered Earths atmosphere, carrying millions of chimerian refugees. Once the humans make contact with the vessels inhabitants, tensions quickly rise when the new arrivals are detained by man and sent to internment camps.
&lt;br&gt;
The chimerians rebel, sparking a civil war that erupts into thermal nuclear war. The devastation forces a treaty, as both chimerians and humans struggle to rebuild. With the first of the new settlements coming to fruition, gangs rise up to take advantage, sparking gang wars that threaten to consume all that has been accomplished. 
&lt;br&gt;
Originally called Cat City because the game starred the authors two pet cats; this first tale follows Tuffy Baxton as he struggles to survive on the grungy streets of the Slums. He is bullied by his teacher, the notorious Stuffedy Gang, and Ducklinga Stuffedy with his own crew of wannabe gangsters. Upon meeting Pounce Jigga Bounce and his band of misfits, Tuffy is taught to face his demons head-on. But is the price for standing up for yourself really worth it if you have to become the very thing youre trying to destroy?" />
