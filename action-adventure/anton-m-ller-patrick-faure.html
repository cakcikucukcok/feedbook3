  <title>Anton Müller - Patrick Faure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The rewards of nanotechnology looked so promising! Yet Max Foremanthe CEO of Pessinus Industries, the corporation that created nanotechnologyis on the run. Unwittingly, he has unleashed a technological Armageddon that is being orchestrated by his largest client, US General Buzz Hamilton. The threats that he had himself identified have become the reality of an attempt to revive Hitlerian ideology. Now caught between Interpol; the banking authorities; a business partner who is no other than Nazi fugitive, SS General Anton Mller; and remorseless killers who are determined to see the Buzz Hamilton project to fruition, Max is desperately trying to make sense of it all. He must navigate the parallel worlds of a defunct dictatorship that aimed to purify the human race, a world of pathologic supremacists, and the nightmares he has created. During that time, people die. By the tens of millions. The predictions written in the past have become the hellish reality of the present. 
Confronted with the darkest side of the human mind and its greed for money and power, Max has no choice but to compromise his ethics and his own invention and to reach an alliance with the agents of a foreign power that will help him regain his reputation. The price of redemption is the loss of freedom and the sinking into yet another genocide. 
Despite it all, Max meets Nicole, the woman who will energize him to rectify the errors of the past. She uncovers the only possible solution to stem the planetary extermination his technology will eventually generate. Entangled in a web of destructive relationships, the mystery of a French village decimated by the SS, and fights with a team of determined psychopaths while attempting to solve the riddle of a Nazi war criminals past, Max is faced with the eventuality that, whatever action he selects, his nanotechnology will destroy the human race. 
In Anton Mller, Max confronts the frightening ghosts of the past and an even more terrifying vision of the future. In a world where human greed and passion prime over the fundamental need to defeat the implacable logic of technology gone wrong, will Max be able to stop the annihilation of the better part of the human race?" />
