  <title>The Tennessee Mountain Man - George Moon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My writing style is like a wheel. I begin with the hub then branch out into other tales; however, before it all ends, I bring it back so that it all makes sense. Im able to describe a murder as well as sex without resorting to explicit detail like so much found in todays fiction. By the proper use of language, I accomplish the same emotional response from my readers. 
The reader often finds interesting essays that digress from or adds to the main plot. They might include slices of local history or an explanation why certain things appear as they do. My stories are told with the reader in mind. The plots are fast moving and contain enough surprises to hold the readers attention. 
The Tennessee Mountain Man is my third book. It takes a popular character from the first bio novel, Renos Funmakers, and gives his exploits after five years of marriage. The year is 1861, and the trouble down at Fort Sumter, in South Carolina, not only changes the United States but Jack Leffingwell and his family. 
Along with the main plot, my books never fail to offer the reader information that was previously unknown, making it a learning experience." />
