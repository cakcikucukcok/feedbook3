  <title>Parastatal Bureaucracy - Will Swansen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some people in powerful positions will wake up to an apocalyptic epiphany and relentlessly pursue the outcome no matter who and what stand in their way. They will walk away after the fact and never look back on the havoc they have created. Duggy learned soon that when people are managed in fear, management would be clouded with lies. 
Duggy endured a rough childhood, but it equipped him with a sense of survival. He despises unfair conduct. When Duggy learned that he was set up for failure, he resorted to experiences as far back as his childhood to the detriment of those who appointed him and did not reckon with Duggys survival instinct. His athletic ability and general knowledge paid off when he faced certain death.
When Duggy was sent on a venture to negotiation between the World Bank and the Nigerian Government in building a power line in Nigeria, things turned sour when Debby, the advisor to Prince Victor from Nigeria, attempted to smooth things over with a short dress and silky legs.
After a bad turn of events, Duggy became a stowaway on a cargo ship where he discovered merchandise, which landed him in deeper trouble than he ever anticipated." />
