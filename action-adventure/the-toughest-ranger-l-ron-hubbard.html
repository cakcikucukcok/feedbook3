  <title>The Toughest Ranger - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;A perfect role for a young Kevin Costner, saddle tramp Petey McGuire has been kicked around so long, he&amp;rsquo;d run away from his own shadow if he could. But there&amp;rsquo;s one fight he can&amp;rsquo;t run from&amp;mdash;the fight against hunger. Petey needs a job quick. But the only way to get one is to act cool and talk tough. And he succeeds all too well&amp;mdash;landing in the saddle with the Arizona Rangers . . . where he learns exactly what it takes to face the meanest outlaw and win the prettiest girl.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Born and  raised in the twilight of the Old West&amp;mdash;from Nebraska plain to the  mountains of Montana&amp;mdash;L. Ron Hubbard grew up in the company of real  cowboys and rugged frontiersmen, even becoming a blood brother to a  Blackfoot medicine man.
