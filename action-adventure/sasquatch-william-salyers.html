  <title>Sasquatch - William Salyers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Abducted as baby at tender age of age of 6 months by a supposedly mythical Sasquatch Big Foot. Raised in a secluded topsy turvy world consisting of both dinosaurs and mammals, where fighting for your life against vicious raptors and sabre-tooth felines is almost a daily occurrence. Ab may be the smallest and ugliest Sasquatch in the clan, but blessed with a human mind, he is by far the smartest, bravest and most dangerous member of the clan. 
     Shunned for his physical deformities and often barred from many clan rights, Ab becomes a loner whose life is dedicated to protecting the less intelligent members of his clan in hopes of someday gaining full acceptance within the clan. That is until his Sasquatch mother reveals to him with her dying breath he is not clan. He comes from the far off and forbidden land of the Hairless Others. That is why he looks so different from the rest of the clan. She stole him from his true mother when he was an infant just before she died. She tells him his world is through the forbidden crack in the rock and tells him he should go home. Go back to the world he came from.
     Shocked and confused over this knowledge and devastated over the loss of the only mother he has ever known, Ab finds this forbidden entrance between their two worlds. A dark tunnel through a massive mountain filled with numerous deadly hazards. Stark naked, Ab emerges into the world he was born too, only now as a muscular cross between a caveman and total wild man.
      A marvel to modern man he is the focal point of numerous scientific and research teams who want to study him. DNA tests along with finger and foot printing reveals his true identity. The son of billionaire parents who own a powerful electronics manufacturing business and who had been accused of and believed to have killed their son as an infant even though they remained steadfast in their story a Sasquatch had stolen him. 
     Sought after and hunted by professional big game hunters for the pure blood sport, it is modern man against prehistoric man in a battle of wits and determination. Especially after Ab unwittingly leads the big game hunters back to his forbidden and lost world with their high powered weapons and modern technology. Now everything he ever knew and understood faced destruction at the hands of these ruthless killers.
     To insure Ab helps them in their quest to satisfy their lust to kill, they took his true parents hostage to use as bait to draw Ab and the long lost and believed extinct raptors and saber-toothed cats as well as the Sasquatch into their cross hairs for true extinction." />
