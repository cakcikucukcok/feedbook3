As Sam, three other women, four men, and Edith are all brought together by a variety of strange happenings that include a runaway wife, a kidnapping, and a shooting, they form strong bonds that lead each of them to realize that even in the worst of circumstances, it truly is possible to create happy connections with complete strangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circumstantial Connections shares the heartwarming tale of nine strangers brought together by unusual twists and turns who learn to trust that life will always lead each of them in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
