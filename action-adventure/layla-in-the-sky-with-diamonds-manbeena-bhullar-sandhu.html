  <title>Layla in the Sky with Diamonds - Manbeena Bhullar Sandhu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It has been twenty-four hours since Layla last had cocaine. The blonde American now on a flight to New Delhi with her one white child and one brown child is struggling to keep it together. As she departs the airplane, all she can focus on is how quickly she can hook up with her friend and drug baron Leonardo so he can provide her with her next fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Layla, a flower child of the 1960s, has travelled around the world in search of a utopian land. Her life story begins with her wild rock and roll years in New York and continues on to tell of her hippie days in San Francisco and Goa where hippies of the world converged to partake in a bohemian lifestyle. Here, her heady ways were combined with a few unfortunate incidents and wrong choices, ultimately leading her to her spiritual awakening, but not before paying a dear price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compelling story line weaves 1960s and 70s style hedonism, Indian culture, drugs, family, devastation, passion, spirituality, and endearing characters into an engaging tale. The author takes you on a journey of vivid impressions, bringing to life the spirit of a lost era.&lt;/p&gt;" />
