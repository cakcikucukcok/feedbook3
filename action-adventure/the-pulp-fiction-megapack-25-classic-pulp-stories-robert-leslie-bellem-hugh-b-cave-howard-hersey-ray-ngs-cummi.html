  <title>The Pulp Fiction Megapack: 25 Classic Pulp Stories - Robert Leslie Bellem, Hugh B. Cave, Howard Hersey, Ray ngs Cummi...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Apes! Sex fiends! Gangsters! Mad scientists! Tentacles! Yes, this MEGAPACK has them all, no less than 25 lurid tales ripped from the pages of pulp fiction magazines. For The Pulp Fiction Megapack, we selected stories with great pulp titles. (Where else are you going to find stories like &quot;Blood for the Vampire Dead,&quot; &quot;Mistress of Snarling Death,&quot; or &quot;When Super-Apes Plot&quot;?) Of course, these stories were all written in a different time, with different standards of what was acceptable. They are decidedly NOT politically correct by modern standards. Please go into them aware of this fact, and if you are offended by racism, stereotypes, bad writing, sadism, or anything else prevalent in cheap literature of the early 20th century...well, this may not be the right ebook for you. But if you can sit back and enjoy these stories for what they are-simple titlations from another era-you may find some surprising treats. &lt;P&gt; Included are: &lt;P&gt; BLOOD FOR THE VAMPIRE DEAD, by Robert Leslie Bellem&lt;BR&gt; MISTRESS OF SNARLING DEATH, by Paul Chadwick&lt;BR&gt; FIANCES FOR THE DEVIL&#39;S DAUGHTER, by Russell Gray&lt;BR&gt; THE SHRIEKING POOL, by G. T. Fleming-Roberts&lt;BR&gt; DEATH MATES FOR THE LUST-LOST, by Hugh J. Gallagher&lt;BR&gt; THE DOGS OF PURGATORY, by Hugh Pendexter&lt;BR&gt; WHEN MANHATTAN SANK, by George S. Brooks&lt;BR&gt; BRIDE OF THE APE, by Harold Ward&lt;BR&gt; BLOOD-BAIT FOR HUNGRY MERMAIDS, by John Wallace&lt;BR&gt; SHIP OF THE GOLDEN GHOUL, by Lazar Levi&lt;BR&gt; BLACK POOL FOR HELL MAIDENS, by Hal K.
