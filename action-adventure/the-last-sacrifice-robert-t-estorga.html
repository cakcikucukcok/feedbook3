  <title>The Last Sacrifice - Robert T. Estorga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if the war with Germany didnt end in 1945?
What if some leaders of the Third Reich had escaped and some convicted at the Nuremberg trials were summarily released?
What if a brave few fought an intense, epic battle years after the war only to discover a terrifying secret the survivors knew no one would believe?
In a truly epic adventure, Zachary Zac Holmes is coerced by friends, compelled by an earth-shattering discovery and finally kidnapped by a secret agency to retrieve a legendary relic and stop a plot to enslave the human race. Zac discovers the meaning of sacrifice as all dedicate themselves in a climactic, must-win battle against an ancient evil the world has unwittingly embraced.
This story was inspired by historical eventsfrom the disappearance of a researcher in one of the most terrifying places on earth to the shocking outburst at the Nuremberg trials of a hidden fortress built for Hitler in the same region of the world!" />
