  <title>Return to Graveyard Road - Melissa F. McClain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="RETURN TO GRAVEYARD ROAD
Expect the unexpected.  Thats the best rule to follow while traveling Graveard Road.  Deceit, treachery, disasters and destruction are imminent.  Johnny Royce is dodging these weapons hurled at him like great balls of fire.  Their origin?  The fiery pits of Hell.  They are directed at him by the rulers of darkness that rule this world.  Their hope is that a direct hit would derail the divine mission this young man is being led to perform that would lead many up the staircase to Heaven, rescuing many souls that are headed down the highway of destruction and doom.
	Johnnys fiance, Cindy Marie senses the role he would play one day in the saving of many misguided souls, but he is oblivious to the calling on his life, for now he finds it hard to keep his eyes open during the sermons at church.  He only attends church at the continual pleadings of Cindy Marie.  Unknown to him many prayers are petitioned for his salvation.
	All the while Johnnys arch rival, Jerry has his own designs on Cindy Marie and will stop at nothing to have his way.  After all with Jerrys father the owner of a chain of hotels and very wealthy, Jerry is used to getting his own way.
	Johnnys plans are shattered when he is framed for a robbery, finding himself on the run many miles from home.  He must prove his innocence, but time is not on his side, the sands of the hourglass of life slipping away.  Prison is becoming more of a reality for him with each passing day, his music career now just a fleeting dream.
	Sadly out of desperation Johnny turns to drugs and drink just to maintain.  Will his cries for mercy be heard or will the death angel strike first to guarantee his reservation through the wide gate that leads down the road to doom and hell fire?
	This powerful novel is packed with action, romance, muscle cars and martial arts, the author seeking to entertain while maintaining the message of good over evil.  It is a wakeup call, generating the realization that there is still time to change the road you&#39;re on. So fasten your seat belt and heed the warning signs for there is no speed limit on Graveyard Road." />
