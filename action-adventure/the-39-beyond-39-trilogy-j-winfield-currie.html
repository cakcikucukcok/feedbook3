  <title>The &#39;Beyond&#39; Trilogy - J. Winfield Currie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A tale of passion, betrayal, and courage set in the Carolinas during the Revolutionary War  an unforgettable love story seamlessly interwoven with both real and fictitious characters.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond All Reason&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book I  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Awakening Passion&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful saga of courage and passion, set in the South during the Revolutionary War, unites Kathryn MacLean, sister of a rebel militia leader, and Colonel Jason Tarrington, a malicious British Green Dragoon  two dynamic individuals abruptly thrown together, their destinies forever entwined by a life-changing twist of fate. Conflict, betrayal, and loyalties torn asunder drive Kathryn and her brother to opposite sides in an ugly war  her enduring passion for the &lt;i&gt;wrong &lt;/i&gt;man and his cause, pitting her against all she had once held dear. Driven relentlessly to succeed in a bloody war they will ultimately lose, can Jason and Kathryn survive? For theirs is a love &lt;i&gt;Beyond All Reason&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond All Odds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book II  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Rebuilding Shattered Lives&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the acrid smoke clears after the battle at Guilford Courthouse, NC, Lieutenant Jackson, a British Dragoon, finds himself miraculously still amongst the living. Scanning the endless bodies scattered across the oozing red mud, he discovers devastating personal loss. But grieving must wait. He has a sacred promise to fulfill: save an innocent child from becoming a pawn in this ugly war  for she would be considered a valuable prize by either side. It was &lt;i&gt;her notorious parents &lt;/i&gt;who had led many an English victory in the South.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Beyond The Horizon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Book III  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life Comes Full Circle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Revolutionary War has been declared over, but to the citizens of Charleston struggling to forget past humiliation suffered under Lord Cornwallis, ongoing British presence is a bitter reminder. The Tarringtons, just arrived from England and embroiled in a dangerous mission of their own, must not be recognized. The success of their crucial undertaking depends on that. Once accomplished, they intend to start life over, but who to trust and where to go? Perhaps their answer lies in the vast forests of the Carolinas where endless possibilities exist. But danger lurks on all sides: devious strangers, former dragoons  even &lt;i&gt;family&lt;/i&gt;. Share Kathryn and Jasons tale of enduring passion and courage as their life unfolds and comes full circle.&lt;/p&gt;" />
