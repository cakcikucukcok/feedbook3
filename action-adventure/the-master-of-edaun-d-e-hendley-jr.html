  <title>The Master of  Edaun - D. E. Hendley Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Master of Edaun; Blood of Brothers
The righteous warriors shall prevail!&#39;
Three men meet in the military. The men discover from each other their lives mirrored each other.  Each man, Native Americans and taught the artistry of weapons and the visions of medieval warfare. Odd each discovered the others grew up the same way. Yeah all had twisted crazy fathers right? To top it all off they each enjoy the life as knights and swordsmanship. 
Any way after their stints in the military they decide to join together as archaeologist. During one of their digs, they discover another world. A world where evil rules. Our long time friends journey deep into a world where evil has taken over. Was their fathers seers of the future? Or do things really connect?
Human kind has not woven the web of life. We are but one thread within it. Whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves. All things are bound  together. All things connect....
-Chief  Seattle-

Hunter, the lead character in the book, is helped by his long time friends Jinx and Tunk. Three Scottish brothers OCey, Mac and Dilman join in battle for the freedom of Rhea. Young Dil introduces a new gift he has developed. This gift  helps in the crusade but could be dangerous.
An evil wizard, Alexar, controls from the captured fortress Edaun. His rule is ruthless as he heads murderers, thieves and the nasty creatures that roam this island called Rhea.
Step into the Master&#39;s world...
The righteous will come, and the giants will be avengers of the slain.  The people will arise and the eagles will again take flight.
