  <title>Kill Slade - Victor M Alvarez, Michael R Valentino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the cold dead of night, the Hatcher brothers break into Slade&amp;rsquo;s house, kill his wife of six years, Emily, and leave him for dead. But Slade is still breathing when his friend Josh Evans and his wife Lynn, Emily&amp;rsquo;s twin sister, find him draped over his wife&amp;rsquo;s body. After six months of recuperation, Slade and Evans set out on the trail of revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the town of Oakhill, Texas, Evans is killed, but not before Slade shoots and kills the outlaw in a gunfight. Taking his body back to his wife by train, Slade is attacked by another of Hatcher&amp;rsquo;s gang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he returns to Oakhill, Slade is attacked once again in his hotel room by one of the Hatcher brothers and a gang of four other outlaws. After a furious gun battle where Slade is injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Slade and Lynn Evans join thirty members of Company C, of the Texas Rangers out of Austin as they ride toward the remaining Hatcher&amp;rsquo;s hideout. They are ambushed in a gorge. Several rangers, in running gun battles, kill the outlaws one by one. But in the process Lynn Evans is mortally wounded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Slade survives and now put his guns to use once again, as he takes up the badge of the Texas Rangers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
