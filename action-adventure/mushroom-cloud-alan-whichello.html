  <title>Mushroom Cloud - Alan Whichello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Set during the 2nd World War, Mushroom Cloud is an account of what could have happened if Germany had developed the nuclear bomb before America and the Americans could not support, or help Britain anymore. What if Adolf Hitler had such a hold over Britain that Churchill had to surrender to Germany? What would have become of the Royal Family, the Prime Minister and the government? But most importantly, what would have happened to the British people and their way of life?
This gripping, sometimes harrowing story follows the lives of four different groups of people as they react to a cataclysmic event in war-torn Europe. In the cause of freedom, some risk their lives, some lose their lives and others find true love. 
Alan Whichellos first novel demonstrates a natural story-telling ability, which will have the reader hooked from the start" />
