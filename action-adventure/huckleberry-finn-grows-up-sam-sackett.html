  <title>Huckleberry Finn Grows Up - Sam Sackett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With his last adventures officially behind him, Huck Finn has just made up his mind to escape Aunt Sallys wishes for him to get sivilized. Without a second thought, Huck strikes out for the Injun Territory on foot, leaving Tom Sawyer and Jim behind. But before long, the mischievous Huck Finn soon realizes that getting to Injun Territory is not going to be as easy as he thought.
It is not long before Huck secures an opportunity as a drover for a party of settlers heading for Oregon. As soon as he feels confident he is headed in the right direction, the settlers inform him he is closer to Injun Territory than he thinks. After he departs from the family, he meets a traveling doctor who convinces him to be a swami; and an Injun named Mankiller who introduces him to the ways of the Cherokee tribe and teaches him about responsibility. As he slowly immerses himself into a new life, Huck sees another side of racism, falls in love, and learns what it is like to become a man.
In this adventurous tale, Huckleberry Finn embarks on a journey of self-discovery where he eventually uncovers the truths about sivilization, slavery, and the differences between right and wrong." />
