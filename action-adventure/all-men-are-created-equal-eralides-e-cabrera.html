  <title>All Men Are Created Equal - Eralides E. Cabrera</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The inequalities of man are certainly a big theme of this story. But its biggest dilemma is that of choice. Having established two opposing concepts, the thrill of freedom and the evil of slavery, the story heads toward a plotthe inevitable confrontation between the two concepts. The two most controversial characters of the story face each other in the end. One has all the power necessary to control the other one&#39;s fate, but the other one, a slave, has now gained an advantage. She has reached a land where she is free. She can finally break the bonds that enslave her. But will she? Will she walk away from the love of a child that sees her as her mother? More important, the battle seems to change protagonists. It is now freedom against love, love for a man that a slave woman cannot have, and thirst for a freedom that will dissipate by accepting the other." />
