  <title>The Case of the Yellow Flower Tattoo - S. N. Bronstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For private detective Fairlington Lavender a missing persons case is routine, especially in the unrestrained, neon subculture of South Miami Beach. The Case of the Yellow Flower Tattoo was everything but routine. 
In 2009 Lavender is contacted by Betsy Rodney, a retired New England school teacher who, along with her retired twin brother Richard, lives in a well ordered, predictable, and sheltered world of their own creation that resembles a 1950s lifestyle. 
This strange and peaceful existence is shattered when Richard disappears without a trace. 
In his attempt to locate Richard Rodney, Lavender dives into the nefarious world of South Beach nightlife and finds himself face to face with the Russian Mafia. The connection between Richard and the underworld confounds Lavender until he discovers a Russian girl named Yana who proves to be the link between the mob and Richards disappearance. 
Lavender digs deep; deeper than he should, in order to locate Richard and his mysterious new friend. His investigation techniques utilize 21st century technology along with 1940s era deception, subterfuge, and muscle. 
The Case of the Yellow Flower Tattoo takes the reader on a trip to South Beach and reveals the shadowy side of this city. Its classic Fairlington Lavender at his best." />
