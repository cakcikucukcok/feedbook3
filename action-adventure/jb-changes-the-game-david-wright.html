      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Having survived the treachery of those closest to him, JB is&amp;nbsp;still standing. Our forward thinking leader&amp;nbsp;has devised a&amp;nbsp;plan to move his family towards a more legal direction.&amp;nbsp;After dealing with death, murder and loss, for as long as he has,&amp;nbsp;JB has developed some new ideas on switching things up.&amp;nbsp;Everything is changing around him as well. Besides the&amp;nbsp;Italians moving differently, the Mexican Cartel has become&amp;nbsp;more demanding and more blood thirsty than ever. In a life&amp;nbsp;surrounded by this much revenue, deceit and&amp;nbsp;betrayal are&amp;nbsp;sentiment&amp;rsquo;s expressed like hello. JB begins to see his life for&amp;nbsp;what it is and makes some new alliances, all while doing his&amp;nbsp;best to keep things tight with the old ones he already has. He&amp;nbsp;doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to shake things up to much, because his family&amp;nbsp;is still healing from the losses suffered in the last homicidal&amp;nbsp;adventure. Assassinations are at an all time high, and because&amp;nbsp;of deals made, the family is in deeper with the Cartel more&amp;nbsp;than ever. He attempts to find a new life, while still being&amp;nbsp;called, tormented and haunted by his past. JB is torn&amp;nbsp;between loving his family and trying to find a way out. We&amp;nbsp;know if nothing else, he&amp;rsquo;s always loyal. We join in to find JB&amp;nbsp;still moving and shaking, controlling Detroit and other city&amp;rsquo;s&lt;br /&gt;
around the U.S. Let&amp;rsquo;s pick up where we left off and watch JB&amp;nbsp;as he changes the game!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
