  <title>Homecoming - Tz Krasner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anna Carter, Sue Hamilton and Kat Walker are the trio of teen superheroines known as Legacy. Two years ago their parents- the superhero team known as the Freedom Warriors- were murdered&amp;nbsp;by a crazed vigilante known only as Darkwatch, and now the girls have taken up the cause in their hometown of Boulder City. But when Sue&amp;#39;s older brother John returns after a prolonged absence, he brings with him a warning. Darkwatch is back, and he&amp;#39;s coming after them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all is not as it seems. John is hiding things, including his connection to the mysterious anti-terror operative called Prism who&amp;#39;s shown up in town. And when Anna is revealed to be the inheritor of her mother&amp;#39;s role as the Avatar of History, guardian of a powerful collection of artifacts, things only become more dangerous. Someone is letting the artifacts loose in the world, and in their city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As new allies and new enemies continue to pop up in their city, the girls slowly come to realize John may be hiding the biggest and most horrifying secret of all from them: the shocking true identity of Darkwatch, and the real reason their parents were murdered.&lt;/p&gt;" />
