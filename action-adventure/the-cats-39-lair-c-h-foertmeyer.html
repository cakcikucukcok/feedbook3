  <title>The Cats&#39; Lair - C. H. Foertmeyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if the Bible were not complete? What if something existed, so beneficial to mankind that it had been intentionally omitted in order to protect its existence through complete secrecy? What if there were a place named Father Mountain, and within it, Ahveen? What if there were Guardians?
&lt;p&gt;Jim Preston and Red Porter, twenty-year-old workers at Miller Foundry in Rockaway, Illinois, are about to find out the answers to all these questionshigh on a mountain in a remote region of northwestern Colorado. But by the time they reach twenty for the second time, it will be no more than a faint and hazy dream to them, knowing no more than what they have been permitted to learn by the Guardians of Father Mountain and their &quot;former&quot; selves.
&lt;p&gt;Inside &lt;i&gt;The Cats&#39; Lair&lt;/i&gt; resides the hope of the world...OutsideJim and Red are threatening that hope...Born into two lives, their second lives would not reveal to them what their first presence had discovered about &lt;i&gt;The Cats&#39; Lair&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;What then led to their discoveries in their first lives? Curiosity...and an old map.
&lt;p&gt;What stopped them in their second lives? The answer to that resides within &lt;i&gt;The Cats&#39; Lair&lt;/i&gt;..." />
