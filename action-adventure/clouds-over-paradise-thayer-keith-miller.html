THIS STORY WILL APPEAL TO YOU---If you are interested in amateur radio, ocean sailing, travel and adventure.
Ive never heard such a story.  It ought to be a best seller!  Thomas I. Kolstad, Captain U. S. Navy
Very interesting reading!  CQ Magazine
Definitely, this story is meant for a television series!  Tony Lopopolo, Literary Critic
Thayer Keith Miller is the best qualified person to tell this storyships officer, ham radio operator, cruise consultant and operator of sailing expeditions in the South Pacific.  He shares this knowledge and expertise as he recounts the adventure story in detail based on original logs, diaries, notes and personal recollections.  It is perhaps the most detailed story you will ever read and it is very informative in this edited and shortened account.
The author was arrested in Hong Kong and imprisoned as a suspected spy.  Later, without a passport or money he was shanghaied in Singapore and held as an impressed seaman for three months.  He recounts his rescue at sea off the coast of Kenya by an armed boarding party and his repatriation in a top secret operation planned by the U.S. State Department.  His friend was later murdered in the Seychelles while making arrangements to reunite the author with his girlfriend.  A disturbed passenger and crew members caused troublephysical and verbal abuse with accusations of sabotage and mutiny. The author describes how the international amateur radio fraternity played a vital role in his escape from circumstances because of his shipboard operation as WA3EFH maritime mobile.  A TRUE STORYBETTER THAN FICTION.  READ IT NOW!
Many of the events took place in the Seychelles, an island  chain sometimes  known  as the Paradise of the Indian Ocean and original site of the Garden of Eden, hence the title and its implications." />
