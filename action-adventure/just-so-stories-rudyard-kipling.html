  <title>Just so Stories - Rudyard Kipling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Written originally for his own children, Rudyard Kipling&amp;#39;s&lt;em&gt; Just So Stories &lt;/em&gt;have continued to delight generations of youngsters since they were first published in 1902. The thirteen stories collected in this book are meant for very young children, but they engage older kids and adults too with their charming conversational style and simple plot lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These stories are typical examples of the &amp;ldquo;origin&amp;rdquo; story, where children are provided with imaginative rather than practical explanations for the &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;how&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;when&amp;rdquo; questions of childhood. The &lt;em&gt;Just So Stories &lt;/em&gt;were tales that Kipling would tell his own daughter who tragically died in infancy of pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early forerunner of these stories can be found in The Second Jungle Book in the chapter, &amp;ldquo;How Fear Came&amp;rdquo; where the story of how the tiger got its stripes is narrated to Mowgli. All the fables in the &lt;em&gt;Just So Stories&lt;/em&gt; follow a similar theme. They relate how a particular creature is altered from an original form into its present appearance either by a magical spirit or a human being. So the reader encounters wonderful and fantastical reasons why The Whale Got Its Throat, The Camel Got Its Hump, The Rhinoceros Got Its Skin, How the Alphabet was Made, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Audio Book of this title is also available for free at www.iboo.com/en/audio-books&lt;/p&gt;" />
