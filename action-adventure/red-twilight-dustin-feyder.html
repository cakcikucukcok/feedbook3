  <title>Red Twilight - Dustin Feyder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Red Twilight. Here men may become monsters and
monsters can be beautiful. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Snake Gekks, El Driver, and Richard Blake have escaped the darkness once, but the
darkness has a terrible hunger for life. New plots arise and the hunters must do battle
again, this time accompanied by allies: Joe Dove, a high-ranking member of the Von
Richton Watchers society, and Reizuki Lowe, a mysterious and brilliant young man.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Be it for love, honor, or duty, these warriors will stand and fight again for the
fate of this world. Now they find themselves at odds with a new enigmatic man
Marks Karingson, a man powerful enough to defeat death . . .&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What will your impotent God do? Your God has failed to deliver you from evil a
dozen times already. Your prayers are quaint but utterly meaningless. Your worship
is misplaced. The world will not be spared the never-ending darkness by any unseen
father figure! Nothing but sweet hot blood spilled upon cold earth can hope to fulfill
your miserable hallucinations of peace. I am the sword and the shield that will deliver
you from the grip of sorrow. Only I can materialize your dreams, and I will cast away
despair and I will do it if I have to send us all to hell first!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Send me your lords and your kings, your sisters and your brothers, your
bishops and your fools, sinners and saints. Let them all come and be enveloped by
my rage! You can have your war, and when it ends, I alone will rise as a goddess from
the ashes of dissilience. You shall leave behind. Your lord will grovel in disarray at the
power I shall unveil.
