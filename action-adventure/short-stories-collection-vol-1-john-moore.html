  <title>Short Stories Collection Vol.1 - John Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Global Rescue-Blackpool disaster
     Blackpool pleasure beach is crowded with holiday makers and tourists when a sinkhole appears and changes everything. This 300ft, 70ft deep hole traps people, and on the Big One rollercoaster people are left stranded halfway down the steep first drop. Global Rescue are called in to help. Can they get everyone to safety before the sinkhole claims the coaster ride and other people.
The Station
  A group of friends, caught in a severe thunderstorm, seek shelter in an old derelict railway station. Strange and ghostly events start happening, but the end result is a surprise for them.
The Derelict 
    Earth..2075. Salvage of space ships far and wide is big business for the planet, among minerals and synthetic water generators. The best salvage crew are the Orion crew and they are sent to bring back the Deep Star, a Stella mapping ship, which disappeared in 2019. The ship has re-appeared in the Cylanian system, but is damaged and dead in space. The Orion crew board her but soon find out they are not alone. 
Global Rescues Christmas present 
    The children from a nearby orphanage love this rescue service and watch all Tv reports, and they have always wanted to meet their heros. This year their wish just might come true. Will Global Rescue give them a Christmas to remember?" />
