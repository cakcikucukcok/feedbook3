  <title>Boccadoro - Burton Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When divorce deprives American winemaker Byron Blyseth of his estate in Tuscany, he flees to a nearby island and opens a wine bar called Boccadoro, the nickname given to him because of his &quot;golden palate.&quot; He falls in love with Livia, a gorgeous widow and gifted cook who wins the restaurant star status.&lt;/p&gt;
To Livia, Boccadoro is a dream come true. But Byron is a reluctant host who prefers sailing, diving, and delving into the legends and myths of an island known as a haven for pirates and other misfits since Etruscan times.&lt;/p&gt;
Intrigued by the nighttime cruises of a luxury yacht owned by a sinister lawyer, Byron recruits a trio of local oddballs as fellow sleuths in a daredevil scheme to crack a smuggling ring. But Byron and Livia become targets of mysterious threats and attacks that weave a web of fear around them and turn their island paradise into a nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
Sizzling with the delectable tastes, fun-filled sounds, and vivid sights of the Tuscan islands and brimming with thrills, &lt;I&gt;Boccadoro: The Honorary Pirate&lt;/I&gt; is the perfect summer read." />
