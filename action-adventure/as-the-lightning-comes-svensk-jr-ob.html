  <title>As the Lightning Comes - Svensk Jr. Ã?ob</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This fast paced adventure is like The Bible Code meets The Chariots of the Gods. It weaves together the fascinating themes of ancient astronauts, angel visitations, hidden Bible codes and end time prophecies, with an international conspiracy thrown in.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The story follows the quest of cynical lawyer John Marshall to locate the Tree of Knowledge and then to pass on the key to it to the one called the Son of Man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marshall unwittingly becomes the last custodian of the key when he tries to come to the rescue of an elderly Eastern wise man.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He teams up with fellow American, evangelist and one time Middle Eastern linguistic expert, Marc Arnold. Arnold ropes in the assistance of longtime friend, Kirsty Gordon, a Scottish aristocrat and archaeologist.
