  <title>The Hounds of Annwn 1-2 - Karen Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A bundle of books from &lt;strong&gt;The Hounds of Annwn&lt;/strong&gt; - Books 1-2&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Carry the Horn &lt;/strong&gt;–&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Book 1 of &lt;strong&gt;The Hounds of Annwn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEW JOB, NEW FAMILY, AND IN TWO WEEKS THE END OF A WORLD HE’S JUST DISCOVERED, IF HE CAN’T RISE TO THE CHALLENGE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;George Talbot Traherne is just doing his job on a fine autumn morning, keeping the hounds together for the huntsman of the Rowanton Hunt in Virginia along the Blue Ridge Mountain. Doesn’t pay to get distracted by a white stag in unfamiliar territory, though. Next thing you know, you might find yourself… somewhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The land is the same but not the people. Their huntsman has just been murdered, and George is tapped for the job. It’s an emergency — the Wild Hunt is only two weeks away, and if it doesn’t happen on schedule, the antlered god Cernunnos will take the realm from its ruler Gwyn ap Nudd and find someone who can mete out justice with the Hounds of Hell in his place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George throws himself into the task, finding strength in the mission and resources he never knew he had. The more he comes to feel at home, settling into his new responsibilities, the more he wants to stay and make a life for himself. He’s finally met someone worth spending his life with, even if she’s just a bit older, a mere fifteen hundred years or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can he keep the Wild Hunt on track despite the attempts to thwart it? Will he be accepted by those he wants to defend who view his timely presence and his human blood with suspicion? Above all, what does Cernunnos want of him and how far will he go? Can he survive the attention of a god?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers who are familiar with the sources of Arthurian literature such as the Mabinogion will recognize many of the characters, flourishing still in the world we cannot quite reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Ways of Winter&lt;/strong&gt; – Book 2 of &lt;strong&gt;The Hounds of Annwn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAPPED BEHIND ENEMY LINES, CAN HE FIND THE STRENGTH TO DEFEND ALL THAT HE VALUES MOST, OR EVEN JUST TO SURVIVE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;It’s the dead of winter and George Talbot Traherne, the new human huntsman for the Wild Hunt, is in trouble. The damage in Gwyn ap Nudd’s domain reveals the deadly powers of a dangerous foe who has mastered an unstoppable weapon and threatens the fae dominions in both the new and the old worlds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secure in his unbreachable stronghold, the enemy holds hostages and has no compunction about using them in deadly experiments with newly discovered way-technology. Only George has a chance to reach him in time to prevent the loss of thousands of lives, even if it costs him everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Welcome to the portrait of a paladin in-the-making, Can he carry out a rescue without the deaths of all involved? Will his patron, the antlered god Cernunnos, help him, or just write him off as a dead loss? He has a family to protect and a world to save, and little time to do it in.&lt;/p&gt;" />
