  <title>Grey Blood Series - Taylor Sidney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;An epic novel is about to explode on the scene.  With this novel comes the new concept of provocative music that is intertwined with the story line.  The music is on a cassette (optional) and accompanies the novel.  A novel of this kind doesnt come often.  It runs parallel to the current problems that are monopolizing our society.  This novel is about the exciting adventures of a fugitive on the run, Fuay Donaldson.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This is a story of two sisters (Jomese and Fuay) drawn together because of their troubled childhoods and the turbulent ways of their stepfather.  There is a twist to this story; murder.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Fuay tries to help her sister by concealing evidence of a murder.  The murder (of her stepfather) she assumes Jomese has committed.  Realizing that the town is aware of the violent way their stepfather has treated them, punishment would be minimum if the evidence was found. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Fuay is unaware that it is not her stepfather that is killed but possibly her baby niece, Amber.  Her sister, Jomese is seriously injured during the attack.  She dies before she is able to utter a word in Fuays defense.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Because of the gruesome nature of the crime, Fuay is tried and sentenced to a life of imprisonment at a Womens State Prison.  Feeling betrayed, deserted, confused and afraid shell die in prison, her only hope is to escape with Maude (a female convict that befriends her).  But even that has a deadly twist.  In prison, the code for silence, love and unity is GREY BLOOD.  Family blood in prison is grey and is thicker than any other blood one could imagine.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;This is a story of one womans courage and fight to prove her innocence.  Read along as Fuay tells you in her own words about her perilous journey in the pursuit of justice.  Shell go to any length to bring those responsible for the deaths of her sister and niece to justice.  The clock is ticking and time waits for no one.  In order to do this one has to think, live and survive by the code, GREY BLOOD.  A code she knows all too well.&lt;/P&gt;" />
