  <title>Beings in a Dream - David Field</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Fresh from their adventures in 1599, which ended in Toulouse Cathedral with the public exposure of the murderous Drogo and his brother the Bishop, fifteen-year-old Tommy and Eloise de Narbonne, a countess from the sixteenth century, find their way back to the world of today, where a very sharp culture shock awaits Eloise. Baffled, bemused, confused and occasionally delighted by modern living, Eloise struggles to make sense of the twenty-first century only to find herself transported back to her own time following a violent encounter with Drogo, who has pursued her into the present day. Tommy must again find the route back to 1599 to be reunited with his beloved Eloise, free her from imprisonment in a nunnery, and, with Eloise, enlist the help once more of his friends, the outlaws of the marsh, and capture Drogo, wherever he is hiding. Beings in a Dream, the second volume in the Friends and Enemies series, is another hugely entertaining and imaginative novel from the pen of David Field. A third volume is presently being written. The author lives with his wife and children in Aarhus, Denmark&lt;/div&gt;" />
