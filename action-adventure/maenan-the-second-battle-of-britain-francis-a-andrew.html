  <title>Maenan: the Second Battle of Britain. - Francis A. Andrew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the course of the Second World War, ( 1939 - 1945 ) the British people, regardless of class or creed, pulled together as a single nation  in a way that they had never done so in their  history. Yet, after the war, something went terribly wrong: politicians of all political parties embarked upon the most attrocious assault the nation had ever seen upon its sovereignty and independence. It was as though our politicians, who had so encouraged the British people to fight and die to save the nation from German aggression and Nazi onslaught, were picking up where Adolph Hitler had left off. &quot;Maenan: The Second Battle of Britain&quot; envisages a future time when the British people once again awaken and assert their independence. Their struggle against a hostile United States of Europe is seen through the eyes of the ancient Holmes family of Tregale Castle. The adventures of this family enable us to find the very roots of Great Britain and its means to recover its national sovereignty, dignity and pride as a free and independent country. The novel embraces past, present and future and is a wonderful mix of tradition and state-of-the-art technology." />
