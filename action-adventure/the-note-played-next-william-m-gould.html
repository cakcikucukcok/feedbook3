  <title>The Note Played Next - William M. Gould</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1951, Josh Lowen, an eighteen-year-old student at Bartlett College in northern New England, allows himself to be involved in a tragic criminal act. Expelled from the school and humiliated, and feeling that his life is over, Josh wallows in misery with no expectation of hearing from anyone. A childhood pal, Larry Gerst, remembering times when Josh was there for him, writes to offer his ear and friendship, but Josh, consumed by guilt about his unfortunate choices, buries the letter in a drawer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Larry, torn between pursuing an interest in art and making money, continues on in college. Josh hitchhikes to San Francisco to find work and, he hopes, himself. Larry continues to write letters; Josh answers only some of them.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Boyhood ends. Work and love, and creativity and passion begin to fill their lives. Josh plays jazz and teaches literature. Larry has successes in business and slowly acquires a very good collection of paintings. The two men see each other infrequently during the years that pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not until Larry finally pursues his dream of living in Italy and immersing himself in the art world that everything changes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
