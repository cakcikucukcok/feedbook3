FOR NIGHTS END TO APPEAR.
Another Side of Deadly, as well as Richard Hardys previous books, Heaven&#39;s Climbing Tower and Seven Keys and Ghostly Lovers, describes life as continually spinning towards wholeness. Journey races forward in the solitude of prayer, reality uncovers the ghostly, and the deadly can have heart. Opposites are in the hands of the same outreach. 
In the words of poet William Blake: &quot;this mystery shall never cease; [ how] the priest promotes war and the soldier peace.
With a fifty-year background in ministry, personal and group counseling, health care practice, and finance, Richard Hardy becomes a storyteller to divulge diverse perspectives from a core wealth of experience. 
Discovery without holding on is crucial." />
