  <title>Ballers from Street Hustlers to King Pin - Desemer L Robinson Jr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I spent twenty years of my life in the game. I made a lot of money, had more cars than one man could ever dream of having, and went to all the parties. Man, those were the good ol days. Now all thats left are the stories I have to tell. 
Dont get me wrong, I still have lots of money, but as I sit here now at the age of forty-eight, I wonder if God understands the things Ive done. I wonder what hell say to me when I meet him face to face and try to explain it all. There are many other stories like mine, but my story has a twist to what I had done and why Ive done it. 
I went from rags to kingpin with the help from some good friends. The reason I am telling you my story is so you can get a feel of what my life has been like. And why I had to start a new one." />
