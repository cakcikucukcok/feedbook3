  <title>Broken Border - James Fleming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kim Jon Il holds an iron grip over North Korea, and the world can only wonder what the secretive leader is doing within his borders.&lt;p&gt; 
The deputy director of the CIA, Bob Wells, intends to discover the truth. He knows that if he doesnt, the world could see an attack similar to 9/11, or even worse. With the countrys security at stake, and confidence in the intelligence agency shaken, he cant allow such a disaster.&lt;p&gt; 
The only person qualified to find out what the North Koreans are doing is Dr. Jon London, but the former operative turned his back on clandestine assignments two years ago. Now, he shares a quiet life as a university professor with the love of his life, Dr. Kim Lake, who knows nothing about his connection to the CIA.&lt;p&gt; 
Suddenly, London finds himself enmeshed in a life he thought hed left behind. Hell journey all over the world and enter a land that hardly anyone knows anything about in his efforts to thwart disaster in Broken Border." />
