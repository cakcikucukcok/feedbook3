  <title>Life at Ten Degrees - Otto Nieks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A fter purchasing a new boat he affectionately names Thelma, Pete Mengel bids his Floridian life goodbye and sets sail on the Caribbean Sea. With nowhere to go and a lifetime to get there, Pete has finally found his place in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six years later, as Pete and Thelma navigate toward the Bahamas, he receives an e-mail from Jo Taylor, an old girlfriend who asks to sail with him for two weeks. Pete docks Thelma in a Bahamas marina and waits, wondering how it will be with Jo after six years. But once they are reunited, Pete rekindles the spirit he once thought he lost and rediscovers love in the process. As Pete introduces Jo to all his friends and they begin a new journey together, they soon discover that life at sea comes with diverse challenges that include violent storms, drug smugglers, hidden coves, and run-ins with the US Navy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this intriguing tale set on the high seas, two former lovers take an unforgettable adventure together as both face the difficult decision whether to sacrifice independence for love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
