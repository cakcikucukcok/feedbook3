  <title>Soul Surfer Johnny Rips - Richard, Bill Missett, Mike Cunningham, Mimi Malmed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Bill Missetts final chapter of Soul Surfer Johnnys adventures, we are taken through the journeys of many thrill seeking travelers, as Johnny and his wife Mia finally move to Puerto permanently, and their adventure begins anew.  
       He and Mia meet countless soul surfers who add ingredients to the secret recipe that eventually becomes an award winning course of life to be enjoyed by the two true lovers. As Johnny matures in his new home of Puerto Tranquilo, he learns to digest and learn from the stories of those who have been through what he is currently experiencing.  
       Missett conveys all of the life lessons the couple soaks in during what can only be described as a rich life without riches.  They build a popular restaurant, a beautiful home, and more importantly, a bucket list of friends and memories. 
       The surf remains an important part of their lives, but in this final chapter, Johnny and Mia drop into a veritable Mexican Pipeline barrel, breathing in every detail.  Luckily, a writer like Missett is able to bring us back through that barrel in magnificent detail.  
       We get to know so many characters from the previous chapters as well as new names.  Several members of the famous crowd of Puerto regulars get to add their input this time.  Their stories are told in first person, adding a great feeling of unedited authenticity.  Several of the local famosos reappear, and some of the Puerto Elders walk us through the life and times of the enigmatic surf town.
       Missett writes in such a way that informs, intrigues, and entertains.  This is the most entertaining of his works and deserves a loud applause.  To be intrigued, you must read the earlier Soul Surfer Johnny books.  To be truly informed, everyone should read his earlier Awakening the Soul series.
       A favorite author of all who read his works, Missett put together a great collaboration of stories with Soul Surfer Johnny Rips.  However, in all honesty, we all hope that Johnny has another wave to catch through Bill Missetts eyes.
