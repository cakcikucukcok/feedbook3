  <title>An Eternal Circle - Adam Falconer</title>
      <meta name="description" content=".......The resounding success of the universally-acclaimed and documented Roman Forum construction project has changed Adam and Tyras lives for ever - setting them on a collision course with destiny where their true voyage of inner discovery is only just beginning. In the wake of their monumental enlightenment amid the ruined and deserted backstreets of the Via Claudia and Adams chance finding of the gold and silver rings, it seems life has finally resumed a semblance of normality.
As the leaves begin to fall and the days grow noticeably colder and shorter with the imminent onset of another winter, all appears well in their fine country house where the flickering candle flames and blazing log fires bring warmth and comfort on the chill evenings.
Within the convivial atmosphere of one of Tyras elegant dinner parties, their all-seeing and spiritualist friend, Sophie, announces an impending newspaper article which, ultimately, not only gives them all cause to reflect upon their pasts again but also necessitates a return trip to Italy and a lonely, isolated place where, it seems, the hand of man has not moved for an eternity.
In accordance with Sophies eerie prediction, after only a few short weeks a team of young archaeologists stumble, quite by chance, on something which when unearthed and investigated, serves not only to confound them with its intrigue and mysteries and leaves them searching for answers, it proves to have far-reaching consequences for Adam, Tyra and Sophie as a group - plunging the world of medical science and the occult movement into shock and bewilderment when the true depth of the discovery is made known...." />
