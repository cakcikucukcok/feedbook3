  <title>Cat-Boy Vs the Fatal Game Glitch - Michael Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Arizona&#39;s favorite superhero, 13-year old Cat-Boy, finds himself in the unusual position of having to fight the dangerous Queen Jonester, the video-game character that escaped from his beloved Game-Cat. All of Team Cat must do battle with her digital army, which is seemingly indestructible. Will Cat-Boy be able to defeat the evil Queen Jonester before it&#39;s too late? And just &lt;em&gt;whose&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;side&lt;/em&gt; is Cat-Boy &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very delightful tale, set in Arizona, Michael Morgan has created believable, lovable characters, such as Janetic, Professor Nutt, Leopard Girl, Magma Man, and Wiggles. It is worth noting that one of the most important characters, &#39;&lt;em&gt;General Joe&lt;/em&gt;&#39;, was based on America&#39;s most popular lawman, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Indeed, Sheriff Arpaio has been quoted as saying, &quot;It is my delight that Michael Morgan based the character &lt;em&gt;General Joe&lt;/em&gt; on me, and I am very impressed by his writing talent and publishing ambitions. &lt;strong&gt;Keep up the good work!&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cat-Boy vs. The Fatal Game Glitch&lt;/em&gt; is fast paced and action packed from the first page to the last. Cat-Boy and company are sure to take their place among the classics in American literature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
