  <title>Bermuda Gold - Edward Cerda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The adventure continues with sergeant Rock and his special squad of combat soldier&#39;s fighting for their survival. Once again the Rock and his men have been given an assignment by the higher echelon of command to retrieve not just lost American soldiers but the entire shipment of gold from Fort Knox that was lost en-route to a military base located within the Bermuda Triangle. In their efforts to retrieve this lost gold the sergeant and his men find themselves caught within a giant vortex that transports them deep within the core of the center of the Earth. Their adventure begins and the sergeant and his men find themselves amidst battles between hostile cavemen tribes and hungry dinosaurs trying to devour their prey as well as these human soldier&#39;s.
Deep within the center of the earth these American soldiers find themselves involved in extraordinary circumstances that challenges their daily survival. Their survival skills are definitely put to the test and each soldier knows that the slightest mistake on their part could result in their death.
Sergeant Rock takes his men deep into the center of the earth where adventure and death waits at every corner. The most dreaded adversaries are the meat eating dinosaurs whose only desire is to taste warm and fresh human flesh. In their search for that missing gold, the sergeant and his band of soldiers encounter alien space travelers. Their only objective is to collect more alien life trophies from planet earth. Countless surgical experiments are performed by the aliens on their captured trophies. Some of their trophies are the lost soldier&#39;s that sergeant Rock seeks. Now sergeant Rock has to battle with these aliens in order for him to free their human captives. Blood and guts on both sides will be spilled and many lives will be lost by both sides.
So if you enjoy the excitement of the unknown and the thrill of the battle, then you will want to read this story of courageous combat soldier&#39;s trying to fulfill their responsibilities to their government.
Go with sergeant Rock and his men into the unknown and live their adventures as your own. Every step that these courageous soldier&#39;s take, death waits with its arms wide open to exterminate their individual lives. Bermuda Gold is filled with action from start to finish. Wait for the next action packed adventure that these American soldiers take into the unknown in Blood South (coming soon)." />
