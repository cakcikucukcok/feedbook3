  <title>Of Popes and Kings - Joe Le Blanc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a quiet Acadian village in 1930s Nova Scotia, a shocking murder sends the small town into uproar. Diane was a local, found dead under mysterious circumstances. Paranoia overruns the townspeople as fingers are pointed, but overblown suspicions bring local authorities no closer to solving the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Danny and Bob are teenagers in the small village, working to keep their families afloat despite the depression. They take interest in the murder, as most curious boys would. Stories conflict as one old woman claims she saw a hobo jump off a stopped freight train at the stationbut why would a stranger want to kill Diane?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The more Danny and Bob look into the peculiar details of the case, the more they think someone is trying to cover up the truth. They suspect the higher-ups in their small town are up to something, but who would benefit from a cover up? Possibly someone in power: someone who might not take lightly to the boys snooping around.&lt;/p&gt;" />
