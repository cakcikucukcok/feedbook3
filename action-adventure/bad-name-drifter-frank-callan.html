  <title>Bad Name Drifter - Frank Callan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam Galway is settled in Dalton, Kansas, and is now a local dignitary and respected family man. However, Dalton is a town split in two: north of the railroad line life is decent and ordered, but south of the line, cowboys raise hell and the riff-raff of the world frequent the streets.  Into this town comes Sam&#39;s younger brother, Wes. Wes has seen action fighting for the Union, and now lives by his wits and his gun. He has also lost the dearest things in life: his wife and son. Wes wants to change his life, but there are complications: there&#39;s his nephew who worships him, and his brother who hates him, and he&#39;s fallen foul of the town marshal.  A confrontation has to come. Seems like life won&#39;t let Wes put down roots, but he won&#39;t stop trying." />
