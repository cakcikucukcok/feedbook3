  <title>Dreams or Reality - Phil Bryson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story starts in the mid 1970s and follows the life of Danny who is a very easy going lifeguard and Gina, who works in a bank. They meet and Danny is besotted with Gina, but whereas Danny is a plodder and a dreamer, Gina wants to get on and make something of her life and her job. She is the realist to Dannys dreams.
Ginas parents are Italian and hence she speaks English and Italian.
The story follows their lives and quite frankly, Gina doesnt care how she rises in the world of finance as long as she gets there. This is actually a story of role reversal, Gina is the go getter and Danny is quite happy to drift along. As for Gina, she wants money and power you name it and she will do it as long as it advances her career. She will let nothing or anyone get in her way. She even marries Danny just to get away from her oppressive father.
Once Danny realises whats been happening, he awakens with a start and tries to change his life. Throughout the story there are many twists and turns, it is both a power game and has some very sexy encounters." />
