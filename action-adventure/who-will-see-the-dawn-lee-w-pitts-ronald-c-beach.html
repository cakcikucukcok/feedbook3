  <title>Who Will See the Dawn? - Lee W. Pitts, Ronald C. Beach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the opening paragraph, with the plaintiff cry in the Arabian Desert of an orphaned young boy, to instances of espionage, intrigue and terrorism, a story is spun that is full of suspense and the often frail humanity of mankind that is todays news .  An alliance was struck with the President of the United States Chief of Staff that sent the men and women of Secure Dreams, a security company, into what should have been a routine security task, but one that ends in a battle of survival.  Downing Electronics, a Defense Department contractor, is working on a program vital to the space program of the United States, a devastating security breach has been discovered.  As Reggie Nutsbagh and Toby Preston trace the leaks they discover family treachery is not the only problem, for an enemy, long deceased, seems to have been resurrected.  One of Zachariah Rodzinskis allies, Nutsbagh and Prestons initial introduction into terrorism, is loose and wants revenge.  The fast-paced novel takes us to the deserts of the Middle East, to the Metropolis of Houston, Texas and moving to the rugged plains of Wyoming for a climactic battle.   As this band of courageous men and women, once again wage war against terrorism on American soil, they will see the weaknesses and strengths from within their own ranks that will determine the future of peace in themselves and in the land they love so much." />
