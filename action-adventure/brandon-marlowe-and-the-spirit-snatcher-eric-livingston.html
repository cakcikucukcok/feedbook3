  <title>Brandon Marlowe and the Spirit Snatcher - Eric Livingston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Its hard enough being a teenage boy, let alone a teenage boy with supernatural powers derived from Gods. In ancient times, the Gods warred with the Titans. The Titans fell, but the Gods need for power never ceased. Soon, they channeled their powers into humans, known as Demigods, who could fight their fights for them. Brandon Marlowe is among the cherished few, but life is no easier for him than other boys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He attends school in Tartarus, where a hidden training center exists to cater to these special children. There, Brandon is surrounded by other kids, who are raised and trained to fight the remaining evil Gods and their Demon minions. In Brandons world, threats are always emerging, and he must be prepared. Soon, he will be readysent to battle, like so many before him, in a war to save the human race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Brandons troubles are much closer to home. His older brother has died, and no one knows why. As Brandon prepares to enter the massive battle of God versus man, it becomes his mission to discover the cause of his brothers death and to punish the guilty. But will his quest for vengeance get in the way of his divine battle? And will his world collapse beneath the weight of the truth? &lt;/p&gt;" />
