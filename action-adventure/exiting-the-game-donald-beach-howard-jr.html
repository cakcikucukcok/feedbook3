  <title>Exiting the Game - Donald Beach Howard Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First and foremost, I give God thanks for the ability to expand my mind to show His children we all can change. I knew it would be hard to change my life around, but with God all things are possible and it is the way into the Light of Success. I&#39;ve walked many days in the mist of darkness, but He sent Angels down to guide me along my sinful way in life itself. So thank you Carol Dickerson-Watkins, Larrika Bishop, Marie Dickerson, James Dickerson, and Carl Williams for your loving support. Without this love I couldn&#39;t reach this goal, which God placed in my path. So I hope all my sisters and brothers take the dark veil off the naked eye to see what God has planned in our life as Sinners to become Saints. I dedicate this first book of &quot;Exiting The Game&quot; to this world of life, and all the love ones were lost in Satan&#39;s dark world of pain and destruction.... Amen
This fiction novel has been written by Donald Beach Howard Jr. &quot;Exiting The Game&quot; was based on the streets activities of life, which revolves around the world today.
Thank You and please give the Lord a try" />
