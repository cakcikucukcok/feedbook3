  <title>The Giant - Sam Friedland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 11px; margin-left: 9px&quot;&gt;&quot;Stop right there. It was 
		a voice of measured power, a voice comfortable with command.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 11px; margin-left: 9px&quot;&gt;With these words, we are 
		introduced to a new character in the pantheon of heroic figures, a giant 
		in stature and strength who is but too human in aspiration. Nature has 
		favored him as undefeatable in combat, society has cast him as military 
		champion, yet he longs for tranquility of home and delectation of 
		family. What must he accomplish to earn the right to claim his desire? 
		What must he sacrifice?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 11px; margin-left: 9px&quot;&gt;The port of Girasol, 
		known to all as the beautiful jewel, offers the giant a winters 
		respite from his wanderings. He finds amicable welcome among denizens in 
		the local tavern and there, too, he finds Soessa,
		the copper haired round girl who 
		warms his heart through the coldest of nights. 
		&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 15px; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: -1px&quot;&gt;When 
		the village is threatened by pirate siege, local moneylenders implore 
		him to raise armed defense but, averse to presiding over even one more 
		battle, the giant defers accepting their commission. He encounters 
		trolls with peculiar dietary penchants and wondrous skills, who fathom 
		greater threat concealed within folds of the pirate attack. For they 
		remember the Demonic Titans vow to take as brother he who releases them 
		from interment imposed in ages past by the Great Powers. It is 
		Schadenfreude, master of the pirate fleet, manipulator of lives, who 
		intends to redeem the Titans promise. His cruelty is exceeded only by 
		their treachery, his madness by their craving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-indent: 15px; margin-left: 10px; margin-top: -1px&quot;&gt;Town dwellers, 
bucolics of the country wide around, troll tribes, caravaneers from the distant 
east, and swamp-saurians crystallize alliances to resist their common enemy. 
However, their stand against the far stronger pirates is doomed without the 
giants aid. Devotion among the confederates to their families and to the 
beautiful jewel enables the giant to see his own thread in the grand tapestry of 
the ages and to choose a course of action by which he can both defend Girasol 
and attain the life of peace he seeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

		and gnashing and tearing until she moved no more. The lizards tongue 
		lapped blood from once beautiful flesh. He snickered quietly to himself, 
		Sweet. Very sweet.
