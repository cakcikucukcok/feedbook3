  <title>Al-Qaeda the Spider - Art Aronson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story, partly fiction, partly fact, will open your eyes to the question - Are we safe?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Since 9/11 we have experienced individual radical Jihadic attempts to kill people and affect the economy, namely Fort Hood, the Christmas plane, and Times Square, but not any attempts at mass terrorism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Does this mean we are safe?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not at all!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plots of mass terrorism could be lurking all around us and we are not only ignorant of efforts, but feel comfortable that we are being protected. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Al-Qaida The Spider reveals that mass terrorism may be more than a one day plan. Plans to adversely affect many people and the economy may take many months or years, and Jihadists may be in place in our communities plotting simultaneous or timed actions. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Are brainstormed ideas being developed? And is needed protection in place?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You will hope that people like Toni Sharp are in place and have the responsibility to do the best they can to keep us safe!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet, Is it enough?" />
