  <title>Moon Train Passenger Ride - Jeffrey Zima</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Moss Huxley is pained with the idea of having to live in the shadow of his parents. Ballard Stod is an orphan who&amp;#39;s always been forced to figure things out for himself. They&amp;#39;re both disillusioned with society, but neither of them has the remedy to fix it. Ballard thinks the answer involves a religion thousands of years old. Moss isn&amp;#39;t so sure.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The adventures at Happy Burger and all the other rib-tickling exploits provide them with a unique sense of justice. However, Moss and Ballard&amp;#39;s irreverent sense of humor soon takes an unexpected turn when a series of self-imposed mishaps force them to leave town. They take the Moon Train to a Zoroastrian temple compound nestled in the Lost Coast of California where they meet Ohrmazd, a Zoroastrian magus who takes them on a ride they&amp;#39;ll never forget.&lt;/p&gt;" />
