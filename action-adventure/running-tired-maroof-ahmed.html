  <title>Running Tired - Maroof Ahmed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bilal, a Pakistani honor student with a rich landlord and politician for a father, is on the path to successuntil his father divorces his mother. Bilal loses many of his opportunities, and his familys life of ease was gone. His mother struggles to raise him and his sister, while he does his best to keep his family safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the course of protecting his mother and sister, however, Bilal comes under the scrutiny of the corrupt Pakistani police. Due to an unfair justice system, Bilal is forced into a life of crime. He becomes a robber and killer and must seek refuge at a madrassa where young men study Islam. But in what should be a safe environment, Bilal finds no comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadowy forces that hope to manipulate religion to serve their own purposes fund the madrassa. Bilal realizes children are being brainwashed to become terrorists. He flees to America, but even there nasty surprises are in store. Bilals once-promising life has fallen apart. Will he ever be able to return to the good man he once was?&lt;/p&gt;" />
