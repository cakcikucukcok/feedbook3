  <title>The Nephilim Device: Book 1 - BC Crow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown. Genesis 6:4  Three thousand years ago, they unwittingly destroyed their home world. Taking refuge among us, they have blended into every part of our culture and lives. We never even knew they came. Now, something terrible and ancient is about to be uncovered again. It will threaten all life on Earth, just as it had on their planet once before.  On the eve of his own personal tragedy, Flint Krieger sets out on an adventure in the Egyptian desert. His adventure takes a turn for the unexpected when he finds himself in the middle of a doomsday conflict that threatens not only his life, but all life on Earth. His life will never be the same again." />
