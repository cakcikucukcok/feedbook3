  <title>Into the Darkness - Harriet Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Into the Darkness is the second book in a trilogy; the first being The Eyes of Beelzebub. This is an  adventure story for all the family
Nathan Gladwick continues his battle between good and evil when he embarks on another fantastic mystical journey, this time by giant airship, to reach the next level and to find the Cross of the Holy Brotherhood. Accompanied by Rose and Timothy, he is joined by a colourful group of companions, who each play their part in the adventure. He meets his arch enemy, Dr Kazzan in Paris, and manages to evade him and continue towards Ghost Mountain, but not before the Doctor discovers his destination. 
After an eventful flight, he reaches Ghost Mountain, where he finds the Doctor, in the company of the Knights of the Realm. He survives to make the final ascent towards the castle of Baron de Foe, fighting off the shadow people before reaching the castle, where he finally meets the Baron and finds the Cross of the Brotherhood, only to discover that the Baron has a hidden agenda, and has kidnapped Timothy. 
As the castle crumbles around him, Nathan strives to rescue Timothy, but has to return for a final conflict with the Doctor, who has taken Rose in order to trade for the Cross. Will he get them all back to the airship in time? If they do survive, how will they all resolve their problems?" />
