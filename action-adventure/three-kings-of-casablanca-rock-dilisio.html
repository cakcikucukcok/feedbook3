  <title>Three Kings of Casablanca - Rock DiLisio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is post World War II and the world is returning to normality. It is a time of exploration and Professor Marshall Mane, archaeologist and hero in the recent conflict, decides it is time to become a hunter of history. The history that he searches for is one that has fascinated him since childhood. Now with the means and the authority, he ventures off to answer the burning question: do the gifts of the Magi still exist?&lt;p&gt; 
His research leads him to the always enchanting country of Morocco. Casablanca, to be more specific, is the base of operation and the mystique that surrounds the famous city is very much in evidence. He enlists the assistance of a lovely, yet feisty, Italian archaeological colleague and a Moroccan museum director in his burning quest for answers. Little do they know that their search will be severely hindered by a secretive, international organization that just so happens to be on the same trail.
&lt;p&gt;It is 1947. The mystery, enchantment and romance of French Morocco abounds in a story of adventure and intrigue. The quest is priceless. The combination is potent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
Have you ever been to Casablanca?" />
