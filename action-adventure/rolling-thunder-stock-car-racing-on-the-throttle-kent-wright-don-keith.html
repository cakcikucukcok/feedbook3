  <title>Rolling Thunder Stock Car Racing: On The Throttle - Kent Wright, Don Keith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The pedal meets the metal in &lt;i&gt;Rolling Thunder Stock Car Racing--&lt;/i&gt;the thrilling series that traces the history of stock car racing from the dusty dirt tracks of East Tennessee to the multi-million-dollar, high-tech venues of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;On the Throttle &lt;/i&gt;by Kent Wright and Don Keith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hot young rookie &quot;Rocket&quot; Rob Wilder has burst onto the racing scene in a big way, but that first Cup victory has still so far eluded him. But finally Victory Lane is in sight. Wilder&#39;s leading the pack at Indy in one of the season&#39;s biggest motorsports races when, in an awful instant, his auto racing luck and his magical first year in big-time competition takes a sudden, disastrous turn. For the first time in his fledgling career, the amazingly talented driver must confront his own self-doubts . . . and serious injury. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does he have the stomach--and the steel--to fight his way back to the head of the pack? If he does, he will have to prove it on the high banks of Talladega, the world&#39;s most intimidating racetrack. The engines are hot. The flag is about to drop. Time for talk is over. If Rob is going to win, he&#39;ll have to stay on the throttle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
