  <title>Muslim Fears - Leo G. Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When an American real estate company owned by an Arabic consortium chooses the small town of Bridgewater to house a mosque that will be an international showpiece of Islam, community residents do not know how to react.&lt;/P&gt;
Dan Howard, a freelance photographer, is one of those who are worried. His daughter, Beth, has become friends with Reza Husain, a Muslim. The relationship seems innocent enough, but he has no idea that she is about to become a pawn in a vicious power struggle between two ideologies.&lt;/P&gt;
The town&#39;s Muslims and Christians seem to be coexisting but then Reza&#39;s father, Mr. Husain, is found murdered. As the days go by without an arrest, the media clamors for more details and the town slips deeper into disarray.&lt;/P&gt;
Acting Police Chief Bill Lacy asks Reza to investigate his father&#39;s death. No one knows it, but the mosque will be the site of a final showdown, and the lives of Bridgewater&#39;s residents will be changed forever.&lt;/P&gt;
Taking readers from the sands of Saudi Arabia, to the streets of Paris to a rural, small town, &lt;I&gt;Muslim Fears&lt;/I&gt; is a murder mystery that is both timely and provocative." />
