  <title>The Circle Stone Group - David Mammina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the world of Laven, a spirit has created four islandseach defended by brave warriors. Unfortunately, the island of Sio has been taken over by Gabent, a powerful tyrant. After four Circle Stone Group warriors manage to escape his deadly grip, they seek help from warriors living on other islands. As a young woman named Lenna, with power over nature, finally convinces four Ixie warriors to accompany her back to Sio, no one is quite sure of the true powers of the man they are up against. All they know is that they must stay hidden; if Gabent finds them, he will surely kill them all.
When Lenna arrives in Sio with her new partners and other Circle Stone Group warriors, they soon discover their homes are destroyed and their friends are at their breaking points. With allies on their side and enemies awaiting their next move, the group begins to work toward reclaiming their home. When their friends begin losing their lives because of failed attempts, however, the warriors soon realize their situation is worse than they ever imagined.
In this fantasy tale, these warriors and their new partners must rely on their special powers as they embark on a valiant quest to stop a malicious monster from destroying the entire planet." />
