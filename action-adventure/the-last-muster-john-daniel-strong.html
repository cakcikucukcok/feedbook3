  <title>The Last Muster - John Daniel Strong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aint he the one killed Lee and Frank Lewis over some Mormon . . . a girl? Joey was careful not to say what he was thinking. It was Judge that said all women were whores, and a lot of Mormon women were real pretty whores, especially Clara Williams, even if she was Jeremiah Becks! Joey certainly wasnt afraid of Jeremiah Beck, even if his Uncle Jim had said Jeremiah Beck was dangerous! Nonetheless, unsure if Nate and Patrick would back him, Joey didnt move.
If I know Frank and Lee . . . they asked for it. Leave him to Clay . . . or Windel after Windel grows up . . . Jim Davis turned to face Jeremiah. That right . . . old friend . . . I mean about Frank and Lee asking for it?
You know me. Id never kill a man aint tried me . . . Jeremiahs feet were set, and his open coat revealed his two pistols.
Apart from Mexico . . . when we all had to kill without giving a man a chance . . . but even then you never liked it none . . .
Not like Judge. He always said killings . . . killing!
If he was here . . . you know he wouldnt agree with me stopin the boys. He and Frank was real close . . . dont matter none that Frank asked for what he got . . ." />
