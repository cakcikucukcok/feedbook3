  <title>Ganymede - Terrence Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As a radical Christian Lebanese sect secretly plans an act of terrorism, Colin Gordon begins his next assignment at the American Embassy in Germany. Masquerading as a Foreign Service reserve officer, Gordon is in fact a senior CIA case officer with a specialty in obtaining unauthorized views of foreign governments. But when he receives a postcard from his operational contact Ganymede, everything around him begins to change.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;As the militia launches a series of attacks against United States interests that reach far beyond the mayhem of war-torn Lebanon, Gordons dangerous journey to the truth leads him through the streets of Beirut and Athens, to a terrorist training camp in North Africa, and finally to New York and Washington, where the Secretary of State faces a perilous fight for his life.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this fast-paced tale of international intrigue, tensions between truth and spin rise as a spy with unmatched instincts is immersed in a dangerous and bold strategy to lure the United States into a conflict like no other.&lt;/p&gt;" />
