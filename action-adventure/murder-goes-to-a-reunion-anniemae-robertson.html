  <title>Murder Goes to a Reunion - AnnieMae Robertson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Georgie Anderson received an invitation to her fortieth high school reunion to be held at the Sea Witch Motel on the coast she insisted Michelangelo go along for moral support. That proved to be a fortuitous decision when one of the attendees, Georgie&#39;s old friend Joe, was found dead in the motel hot tub. A second murder made it apparent that someone at the reunion intended to kill a number of the alumni who had been primary figures in a school strike years earlier. The fact that Georgie was on that list pushed Michelangelo into working with the local police to find the killer before more people died." />
