  <title>Lust, Lies and Two Wives - Adrienne Bellamy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lust, Lies and Two Wives
While out of town for the Thanksgiving holiday, on Black Friday, Denise Garner listened to the words on the other end of the phone.  It was Lennys cousin. Listen, Denise, you need to come home. Lenny died of a heart attack yesterday.&quot; Denise immediately smelled a rat named Carolyn Monroe. She had never trusted that trollop her husband had been shacked up with for the past fourteen years. Did Lenny indeed have a heart attack or did his bitch Carolyn have a smart attack? After all, he was worth a lot more to that wench dead than alive, so Denise estimated. 
In this fiction caper, through author Adrienne Bellamy, the character Denise Garner will dazzle you. She will erupt your emotions, all of them. She has infused this book with mystery, facts, humor and intrigue, thus causing you to laugh out loud or seethe with anger. Her sheer energy alone in the investigation of the case will fascinate you. Bellamy navigates Denise step by step and blow by blow as she interrogates funeral directors, insurance claims adjusters, city officials, detectives, forensic experts, hospital personnel, pharmacists, paramedics, attorneys.  You name them, she was there with her files determined to uncover facts proving that her husband was murdered. 
Denise, a dynamically clever trained paralegal,  a thorough researcher and a true bloodhound is a one-woman show, hell bent on going after the bitch Carolyn and teaching her the following lessons, more specifically: If hes got a wife, dont make him your life; A marriage license holds a lot of weight; Not with my husbandyou wont; Dont be the mistressthat could hurt; The married mandont bank on him; Hes not yourshes married; Disasterhook up with my husband; What the mistress gets in the end is a catastrophe; Do the wrong thingand bring on your dilemma; So you want my husbands bodytake your best shot before I crush you; Theres a thin line between love and stupidity; The Turkey and the marriage license; How NOT to steal a womans husband; and; Let the court sayI winCheckmate!
