  <title>The Crown Of Power - Olga Kruchkova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Czech Lands. End of VII — beginning VIII centuries.&lt;br/&gt;
Prince Czech and his large tribe leave their long-inhabited lands in search of a new home. The capital of this new kingdom, named Czechia, becomes ?íp. From ?íp, Czech rules his lands and carries out the court of his fellow tribesmen.  &lt;br/&gt;
Young Krok and his family decide to leave ?íp and to found free land. They find a more convenient location nearby the lake. One day young Krok meets the wonderful Medulina, not realising that she is a forest spirit. Love sparks between Krok and Medulina. Medulina’s parents, God of the Forest, Bohr, and Goddess of Fertility, Didilya, bless their marriage. The young family has three daughters: Kazi, Teta and Libushye. Medulina already knows the fates of her daughters. However, she does not have the power to change their fates, as the fateful threads have been woven by the Sisters of Fate themselves.&lt;br/&gt;
In time, Krok becomes the chief of Budech. In the forests, Prince Ladvik, a newcomer, arrives with his tribe, having left his home territories following the onslaught of Saxon tribes. Ladvik is smart, cunning and worships the god Veles. Veles rewards his faithful worshipper handsomely. Ladvik and his soldiers destroy the land straddling the Czech and Lucian borders. In order to combat Prince Ladvik, Krok enters an alliance with the Lucian prince, Radoslav. Their combined strength means that they rebuke his powers. Ladvik suffers an overwhelming defeat and leaves at once to the forest, where he serves Veles himself, in the form of a bear. However, Veles is displeased that Krok and Radoslav have interfered with his plans. Veles hatches a plan and enters an alliance with Chernobog.  &lt;br/&gt;
Medulina tries to protect her family from Veles’ wrath and saves her husband from certain death. With their combined strength, Bohr and Didilya stand against the sophisticated charms of Veles and Chernobog. Veles and Chernobog’s spells recede for a while. Howe" />
