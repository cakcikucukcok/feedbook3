  <title>A Few Sunny Days in Denio - Mike R. Dunbar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story of a mans love of horses, and of friendships that endure through the best and worst of times. Sam Jackson, the main character, searches, as we all do, for a place in time and space, where he can spend just a few sunny days, enjoying life. That place, for Sam, is in the ranching country, and in the small hamlet of Denio, located in the high, cold, desert of far northwestern Nevada. Denio is a real place, although in this story, the characters and most of the establishments are fictional. Unfortunately, that place and its quirky residents depict an icon of the fate of many small communities in the American West; destined to vanish. The story of Sam Jackson, narrated by his lifelong friend, Joe Running Bear, is about a young mans quest to become a World Champion rodeo cowboy. Traveling a long and rocky road, and with help and encouragement from his friends, he finally achieves his dream, only to lose it all. His friends in Denio, not only nurture his transition from youth into adulthood, but also help heal his wounds after his fall from glory and fame. But, nothing can stop the winds of change, and, like Sam Jackson, the town and its people are also changing; slowly fading into a sea of endless time." />
