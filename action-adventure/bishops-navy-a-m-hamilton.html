  <title>Bishops Navy - A.M. Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bishop was first a paratrooper with the American Army for 4 years, he joined the
Canadian Army and has put in about nine and a half months, but he has found a
home in the Canadian Navy as a soldier. Now a member of the HMCS Vergil a UN
Canadian Navy Patrol boat in Hai Phong Harbor, his missions have changed and so
has his attitude. For once he isn&#39;t working alone, but in a way he still is.
After helping Sergeant Wilkins and the Polish Contingent NCO Sergeant Pogozinski
to disarm a dud smart bomb that landed in the basement of NVA headquarters in
Hanoi, Bishop, who was recognized by Commander Holcomb on the USS Forrestal
as the &#39;Canadian Yankee&#39; has established himself amongst the crew as a man of
action so to speak. He&#39;s unlike any Canadian soldier they have ever known. But that
notoriety may soon be catching up with him.
Major Tennyson is on a mission of his own in Hong Kong along with several other
members of the embassy. Wilkins has decided to take Mai back to her farm so she
can meet with her father whom she hasn&#39;t seen since being ordered to work at the
local military hospital. The invasion of the south isn&#39;t going well, but that isn&#39;t what
the government is telling the populace.
Horst and Werner have started their own mission. Werner is also in Hong Kong
trying to gather information for his report on illegal funds from UNESCO via a South
American country that&#39;s funneling the money to North Vietnam in exchange for
something of high value.
Bishop has a feeling about a ship by the name of Guevara that&#39;s parked on one of
the North&#39;s sunken docks. It&#39;s loaded with hollow wheat, but that&#39;s only the cover,
the real menace is underneath, and he has to try and fi nd a way to discover the truth
and destroy it before it can be used against the Americans. Captain La Rouch has a
traffi c accident, but will he live?" />
