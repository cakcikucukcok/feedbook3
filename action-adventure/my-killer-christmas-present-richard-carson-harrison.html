  <title>My  Killer Christmas Present - Richard Carson Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I yelled once more  give it up son, your body guards dead ,He turned using his same form, the stance and sideways pistol grip as before, the same as when he threatening the lady clerk. He fired sending a bullet into one of the display cases about six feet from me. I fired only once this time, I have no idea why, maybe it was his age, maybe I thought I was giving him a better chance of survival. Is that not ridiculous? One bullet that size at this range, would kill an enraged grisly, much less a skinny, not very well developed kid! He, the kid, was spun around and dropped instantly. I glanced at the two men and walked quickly down to assess the damage. Even though neither of them could possibly ever again be combative, I kicked both weapons across the floor against the wall, I lay my rifle on top of one of the displays knowing the police would be here quickly and might be excited if they saw me holding a weapon and all the carnage surrounding me, with broken glass everywhere. They should have been here when the door alarm and the water heater and electrical noises were present, if they think this is something! The sound effects were dramatic indeed, I can assure you." />
