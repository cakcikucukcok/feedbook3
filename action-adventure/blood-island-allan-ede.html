  <title>Blood Island - Allan Ede</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spencer Hendran cursed himself for being careless and allowing those ruthless scumbags to inflict agonizing pain and suffering upon him and four lovely young ladies whom he had just befriended on his trek through the Boundary Waters. He would hone his special skills, learned as a former Green Beret, and wreak vengeance upon those thugs-even if he had to chase them to Hell and back. They would rue the day they had committed such atrocities against him and those he cared for-especially Marna with whom he had fallen in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;The reader of &lt;I&gt;Blood Island&lt;/I&gt; should not expect to get away from it all in this fast-paced, suspenseful, and often brutal story. Author Allan Ede writes with great detail, and his story is well-paced-often breath-taking and horrifying at the same time, keeping the reader turning the pages in anticipation. A nail-biting, if not eye-covering, satisfying read.&quot;
-Pamela Schuster Ostwinkle-award winning author of &lt;I&gt;The Little Teardrop and Monster Tools&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I sat down one night to read &lt;I&gt;Blood Island&lt;/I&gt;. After engaging in an exciting and twisting plot, I couldn&#39;t go to sleep until I finished reading the entire book. You can&#39;t imagine the suspense, the terror, and unspeakable horror until you experience it yourself, vicariously through the reading. Ede is an up-and-coming writer of thrilling action who has no boundaries.&quot;
-Laura Trentz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;As a former Green Beret, Spence Hendran is a man of action. Laying his life on the line to protect others is what he does. Avenging the violent murder of the woman he loved, is for him, automatic-non-negotiable. &lt;I&gt;Blood Island&lt;/I&gt; is about harsh truths and doing what has to be done. It is not a book for the squeamish.&quot;
-Sharon Helgens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;I&gt;Blood Island&lt;/I&gt; is a thrilling action novel about revenge. Allan Ede, the author, has struck a raw nerve in story telling. He&#39;s brilliant, and &lt;I&gt;Blood Island&lt;/I&gt; proves it.&quot;
