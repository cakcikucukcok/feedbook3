  <title>Shadows in Replay - Derek Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the fall of Phnom Penh, Cambodia and Saigon, South Vietnam, in April of 1975, an illegal secret war began. Using Army personnel, the CIA unleashed &quot;Shadow,&quot; covert operations designed to disrupt the newly installed Communist governments. Now, fifteen years later, the President and the CIA have decided to activate the final phase in Cambodia, an area of continuous civil war. The key: only one man knows the identity of the agent planted within the Cambodian puppet regime. That man is Ross Kinkaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So the stage is set, in the novel &lt;i&gt;Shadows in Replay&lt;/i&gt;, for the re-enlistment and training of this vital, but reluctant soldier of fortune. Now a civilian, Kinkaid&#39;s recruitment has been ordered behind closed doors by the White House. Yet Kinkaid himself is faced with difficult challenges of his own. Still haunted by visions of a failed mission deep within Cambodia, he struggles with the boredom of the 9 to 5 routines. Wishing also to avoid a scandal over his love for his married secretary, Sarah Baron, Kinkaid accepts the offer of active duty." />
