  <title>Judgment In Time - Kevin Klesert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; would happen if a 21st Century US Navy task force on a short mission to test a new ultra-secret weapon traveled back in time with their military superiority and their knowledge of how history played out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will&lt;/strong&gt; they prevent wars? Will they set the world on a better path? Or will they use their advantage for their own greedy benefit?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; caused the time shift? Was it technology, or is there a sinister force at play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secretary&lt;/strong&gt; of Defense Alicia Calhoun, the civilian in command, has had a long, passionate, but unconsummated &lt;em&gt;friendship&lt;/em&gt; with the formidable Admiral Sean Phillips. As the matriarch and patriarch of the over seven thousand men and women of the stranded task force, their personal needs must wait, &lt;em&gt;yet again&lt;/em&gt;. Stuck together in this surreal reality for who knows how long, will romance bloom, or will the tension tear them apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&lt;/strong&gt; happens to the future they all left behind? Will they ever see their family and friends again? Is something playing them like puppets on strings? If so, to what end?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With&lt;/strong&gt; his passion for history and his adventurous imagination, Kevin Klesert brings his characters to life in a story of political intrigue, betrayal, and righteous dissent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
