  <title>Grog Wars - Anne Sweazy-Kulju</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;The wild west was wild but offered challenges to those brave enough for the adventure. Burke Kaufmann, a young German who has been sent by his father to America to expand the family business, is one such man. Burke&amp;rsquo;s father and another man, who has fallen on hard times financially, arrange for their son and daughter to marry. After crossing the Atlantic by ship, they traverse the Oregon trail and finally reach Portland to open a brewery. Grog Wars covers the trials and tribulations of this tenacious young man as he endures the rigors of travel in the 1800s, settles in a strange new town, and struggles to make his arranged marriage work.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;One minute the author has the reader laughing, the next minute anxious and fearful for the characters, when suddenly a touching event stirs the heart. Her characters come-to-life with detailed descriptions and genuine personalities. With danger always around the corner and lots of twists and turns, this book is a highly engaging read. We hated to see the story end. The author has a marvelous handle on subtle humor. Her characters are unique, believable and full of depth. Whimsy abounds within the pages as she introduces historic events and fictionalized accounts in a manner which keeps the interest level high.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Historical fiction buffs are sure to love this book, which is highly recommended for young adult / mature audiences. &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;{Literary Classics&amp;nbsp; Book Awards}&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BOOK HONORS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;2015 LITERARY CLASSICS INTERNATIONAL BOOK AWARDS, Silver Medal, YA Fiction * 2016 CHANTICLEERS BOOK AWARDS, Finalist, &amp;quot;Best in Category&amp;quot; (YA Fiction) &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;* 2015 LITERARY CLASSICS Seal of Approval * 2015 GLOBAL EBOOK AWARDS, Nominee * HISTORICAL NOVELS SOCIETY 5-Star Endorsement * READERS FAVORITES 5-Star Review Medallion (3) * March 2013 WRITERSTYPE INTERNATIONAL, 1st Chapter Contest,&amp;nbsp;Gold Medal Winner.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
