  <title>The Secret Temple of Kintamani - Ernie Palamarek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The exotic tropical island of Bali&lt;/b&gt; is the fabulous setting for the aftermath of the infamous BarLan Bre-X gold mine stock swindle in Borneo which is still thundering throughout South East Asia and echoing around the world.
&lt;P&gt;
A coniving and truly-evil, Irish-Canadian stock promoter from Jakarta, Indonesia has declared bankrupcy and is on the prowl to regain his riches. He stops at nothing; his rampant greed and lust know no bounds. Murder, opium smuggling and fraud are his forte!
&lt;P&gt;
A seductive Balinese physiotherapist nurse lost her family&#39;s fortune. Now her brother is missing from his job as a geologist at the two-mile-high Goldberg Gold Mine in New Guinea. Was he murdered? Where is his gold Ganesa icon? It&#39;s a mystery! In a state of near-collapse she has nowhere to turn!
&lt;P&gt;
This action-packed second novel in a series features the somewhat-jaded but dashing &lt;b&gt;Rune Erikson&lt;/b&gt;, who enters a steamy world of scintillating Balinese myths and legends. He is caught up in the middle of an adventure where the ruthless winner takes all. Rune enlists the aid of his stockbroker buddy, Logan, in a race against time where the prizes are a stolen fortune, a missing brother, and the mother lode of gold. Coloured by romance and eroticism, this intrigue entices Rune off his sailing ketch &lt;i&gt;Valhalla&lt;/i&gt; in Victoria&#39;s Fisherman&#39;s Wharf into the arms of beguiling Asian beauties on the exotic tropical island of Bali." />
