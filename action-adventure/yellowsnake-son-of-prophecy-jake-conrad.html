  <title>Yellowsnake, Son of Prophecy - Jake Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt;When the young Comanche halfbreed was recruited by the U.S. Army Rangers, little did Yellowsnake know where the fortunes of war would take him. &lt;P&gt;
Once Colonel Lincoln spotted Yellowsnake and his survival instincts, their lives would be enjoined for many years to follow. Yellowsnake, under the guidance of his wise Colonel soon wreaked havoc upon the Viet Cong. &lt;P&gt;
After his Viet Nam army tour, Yellowsnake suddenly found himself employed by the CIA, and once again thrust back into the jungle as an invisible operative for the Company. &lt;P&gt;
From the early moments of his life, his spirit and soul were being closely watched over by Shahana, a mysterious Yaqui Medicine Woman. &lt;P&gt;
She had prophesized the terror and danger which would become part of Yellowsnake&#39;s life, and before the tragic accident which Shahana had foreseen could claim Yellowsnake&#39;s life, the old woman would give her last breath to save him. &lt;P&gt;
After his miraculous recovery, the healing warrior&#39;s path crosses that of Jake Montana, an adventure lover and treasure hunter who soon forms a lifelong bond with Yellowsnake. &lt;P&gt;
Their adventurous treasure search takes them deep into the mountains of Arizona in pursuit of one of the fabled Peralta treasure caches. &lt;P&gt;
Yellowsnake&#39;s perilous life had seen him working covertly for Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and for the sinister Manuel Noriega under the close scrutiny of the CIA. However, he knew that with the help of Shahana&#39;s watchful spirit he would someday enjoy the company of those he trusted and be blessed with adventure on safer ground." />
