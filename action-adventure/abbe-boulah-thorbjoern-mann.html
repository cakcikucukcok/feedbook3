A yarn of strange foulups in the intelligence agencies (Counter Intelligence),  various unconventional machinations about a metropolitan mass transit system (Tallahaitian Mass Transit) are mixed in with Abb Boulahs musings about education, (Peace Prize Problems, The Evolution of Education, The Tragedy of Education, Plaintive Soliloqy).  on leadership and power (Stupid Power, On Leadership) a different take on a famous journalists book regarding the shape of the Earth (Flat World Rings Hollow), presidential elections Abb Boulah for Ex-President), even a  kind of utopia  on an abandoned oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico (Rigatopia).  
Other wild  ravings  contain creatively different views on various  global and societal problems, such as interspecies relations (AbbBug-Lah), Mideast problems (Holy Coin), the deplorable lack of imaginative names for real, imaginary and complex numbers (NameYourNumber.zip), the human and legal rights of multiple personalities (Judge Severin M. Aledict), and other recklessly unconventional ideas and proposals.  But even with a final prank concerning emergency planning in the Sunshine State, the mystery of Who Is Abb Boulah? never gets completely resolved." />
