  <title>Bats of Prey - Richard William Stoker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Were living in a world that is vastly different from that which existed when the original Dracula novel was written. Women are now rightly playing much more active roles, including serving as heads of countries and heads of large corporations. We hear of the ecological importance of rainforests regularly in news broadcasts; weve also heard that some newspaper people cant be trusted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Richard William Stoker gave up on the mental health industry when, many years ago, he started a course in psychology and was taught that women arent as smart as men because their brains are generally smaller. At that time he had a girlfriend whose head was considerably smaller than his own but whose IQ was much higher. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was christened and confirmed in the Church of England and when young, regularly attended Sunday school. When older, he couldnt completely accept the Anglican Churchs teachings, nor could he completely accept the Darwinian theory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wanted to bring all of the above elements together in a novel that was relevant to today and found the Dracula concept to be the perfect vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get the details of the locations reasonably accurate, he visited Los Angeles and Las Vegas and travelled by bus from Venezuela down through Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;" />
