  <title>Alice&#39;s Army - Alycia Ripley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ten years have passed since the events of &lt;em&gt;The Final Alice&lt;/em&gt;. While mourning the death of a team member, Alice Pleasance must come to terms with the sacrifices inherent in the job she accepted, one that does not allow vacations or weekends. A job which forces her to never age and never die, making friendships outside the team nearly impossible. Now a perfect hunter and tracker, Alice is emotionally isolated and haunted by a constant stream of nightmares involving twins, a screaming man, and a mysterious shack. When a serial killer embarks on a murder spree in Nigeria, Alice and her team prepare to eliminate the threat. They join forces with the heir of a petroleum dynasty gifted with a unique and powerful ability all his own. But before long, they realize the current murders involve an angry and vengeful old enemy. Gritty and atmospheric, &lt;em&gt;Alices Army &lt;/em&gt;centers on the forces of good and evil in our modern world. It examines the powerful grip of emotional addictions as well as the psychology of fear. This middle chapter of the trilogy reflects on each team members beginnings and defines the concept of family as those who stand alongside us in the darkest of hours against the most terrible of threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ripley&#39;s undeniable, infectious love for these characters is superpowered. Alice is back with her motley crew of supernatural karma commandos in tow. Battle-tested, wiser, and more complex as a team, the new dynamic serves as rocket fuel for the author&#39;s unmistakable voice to shine. Filled with wild imagery, fierce action, genuine emotion and pure whimsy, few authors can so effortlessly glide between a high-velocity narrative and complete phantasmagoria. I loved it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Michael Wandmacher,&lt;/em&gt; film composer: My Bloody Valentine, The Last Exorcism: Part II&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alycia Ripley writeswith grace and delicacy about the sometimes very violent fantasies of young women in a threatening world. The books in her Alice series come to life with their haunting imagery and lyrical prose. These fantasy stories about the adventures of the granddaughter of Alice in Wonderland explore a darker side of one young woman&#39;s response to life&#39;s challenges. With &lt;em&gt;Alice&#39;s Army &lt;/em&gt;she continues the saga of a badass Alice who refuses to be undone. Her strange journey will surprise and delight readers with its many twists and turns.&lt;/p&gt;
