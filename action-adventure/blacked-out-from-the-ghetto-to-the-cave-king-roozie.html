  <title>Blacked Out: From The Ghetto to The Cave - king Roozie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the Ghetto of New Orleans, a young 12-year-old boy Kasey meets his new neighbor, Mr. Murcan and befriends him. Mr. Murcan turns out to be an ex-military intelligence agent. The duo is robbed at the store and has to move because of trouble. Mr. Murcan, Kasey and his mother Mildred moves to a safe house. When all of the power transformers in the world are destroyed, they team up with another agent (John) and his two companions (Brina and Simone&#39;) at the safe house.  They awake to a day of non-stop action. The team hijacks a boat with a family already aboard (Mr. Carlton, his wife Joann, his son Denzel and his daughter Shyne) When Kasey meets Shyne he instantly falls in love.  They struggle to keep the boat moving while docking into unfriendly marinas and testing out their skills. They question whether they will ever have peace.  Once they realize that they are resting in places that can possibly end their lives in many ways, a hasty plan was implemented, and the team went into action again. They relocate to an uninhabited island and attempt to turn it into home. Mr. Murcan and Mr. John teach everyone many survival skills.  Everyone on the team settles down to his or her new lifestyle of non-stop work and action.  Kasey learns that Mr. Murcan and his mom are getting married and it makes him want to marry his newfound love.   Part of the team sets out and discovers a cave in another part of the island. Invaders travel to the island and put the team on high alert. The invaders move closer to the team and the team is now faced with two enemies, both are deadly. The entire world is now a toxic cesspool of death and visibility has reduced to three feet. The team struggles to cope with their new enemy as time ticks away and safe breathing air begins to run out." />
