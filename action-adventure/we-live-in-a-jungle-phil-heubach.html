  <title>We Live in a Jungle - Phil Heubach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a land called the Jungle Kingdom. It was once a paradise where the strong and the weak could live together without fear. Then suddenly, and without warning, a few of the strongest Creatures became predators. With each passing year, their numbers increased, now dominating the land. Today, they are known as the Meat Eaters.&lt;br /&gt;
A young and precocious Rabbit, named Rapid Roberta, is determined to save the kingdom from the increasing numbers of the Meat Eaters. To do so, Roberta will need to overcome her own inner demons and the forces of Nature.&lt;br /&gt;
With her courageous effort to save the kingdom from the Meat Eaters, Roberta must find Cyrus the Great Horned Owl, who is considered the wisest and most compassionate Creature who has ever lived. To find Cyrus, Roberta must journey through the Dark Forest, which is under the shroud of a deadly curse. &lt;br /&gt;
Also challenging Robertas hopes of regaining their lost paradise, is the vicious, outlawed Tiger and the enraged Cheetah, the fastest Creature in the kingdom, who has threatened to have Robertas fury hide. Then, too, there are the giant-sized Gorillas, the majestic King Lion and his Golden Horde, and Queen Cobra, known as the Mean Queen.&lt;br /&gt;
With a zealous desire to fulfill her quest, Roberta will meet Tiny, a shy and cautious Turtle, who would rather stay in his shell than enter the Dark Forest. When they discover that there is some one above and beyond their Cyrus the Great, they are devastated.&lt;br /&gt;
This story seems to have a dark side. However, it is subdued by the love, compassion, and humor found on almost every page. Throughout the story, there are twists and turns, and a mystery that will keep the readers guessing: (With the qualities of love, compassion, and awareness,) who is The Elder that is above all living Creatures? And the primary question is: What actions are taken by The Elder in an effort to overcome the threat of the Meat Eaters?" />
