  <title>Goat Rope - Daniel Blore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Darrington Hunter, a pilot working for a failing airline, bails out of a stifling marriage and into the South Florida fast lane.  The financial pressures of &quot;living large&quot; lead him to liaisons with the quick-buck world of criminals.  A brush with the law emboldens him.  His Flight Attendant girlfriend Sharon Jensen, a stunning beauty with a chronic bent toward the illicit, applauds his march toward the criminal life.  Mysterious forces keep him moving toward crime, even as he internalizes his moral qualms.  Wayne Smith becomes his underworld mentor and guardian.  A man who epitomizes the good life bought with dirty money. A flight in a twin-engine Cessna, deep into South America to support a money-laundering operation, is Darrington&#39;s immersion into the dark side.  His life moves at a feverish pace, and swaying allegiances leave him feeling alone wondering who is who.  He takes back his soul in a rousing ending of score-settling action.  Airline life before political correctness, little airplanes and the sleaze and glitz of the fast lane are all graphically depicted in this tense, soul-searching portrayal." />
