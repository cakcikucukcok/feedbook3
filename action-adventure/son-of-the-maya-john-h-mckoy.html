  <title>Son of the Maya - John H. McKoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Son of the Maya is a international adventure set in Washington, Miami, and the jungles of Guatemala between 2006 and 2009. The drama involves an international kidnapping and daring rescue that pits a wealthy US immigrant foundation executive against a dynamic Guatemalan revolutionary. Roberto Prettyman was born in Guatemala City but raised in Washington during the 1960s. He built an enormously successful suburban real estate practice before turning to philanthropy. A brilliant university political student, Felix Gigante (the Jaguar Paw), was radicalized and then built a powerful revolutionary force after his father was murdered by Guatemalan authorities. Tension between these native Guatemalans with divergent approaches to social change, yet similar perspectives on injustice reaches explosive crescendo after unpredicted twists and turns." />
