  <title>1,260 Days - Craig Conte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1,260 Days&lt;/i&gt; is a journey to a foreign land, a detour called a shortcut in a cab. Its riding on a night train in a warm sweat as you hear the choo choo chuggen down the tracks. Its a vision in a restless dream, a nightmare with a bloody scene, a demon putting thoughts into your head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1,260 Days&lt;/i&gt; is about the man in black. Its about a work shift. Its about a suicidal note. Its the unheard music. Its a forty-day fast. Its a severed artery. Its an itchy rash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1,260 Days&lt;/i&gt; is a holy book. Its a trumpet being blown upon a hill. Its a paradox. Its a riddle. Its a jest. Its hope. Its change. Its woe. Its greed. Its me. Its you. Its them. Its us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;1,260 Days&lt;/i&gt; is about the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found myself alternately astounded, intrigued, and ultimately jealous of Enoch, whose adventures on a daily basis made my own life seem small and mundane by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich Marotta, KFI Radio Inducted 2011, Southern California Sportscasters Hall of Fame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brilliant manurevres of narrative wreaking havoc upon accepted norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tortelvis of Dread Zeppelin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An honest and straightforward book, one mans experiment with disgrace takes on an aura of supernaturally experienced grace. Easy on the ear and steering clear of massaging his own story-telling of an awfully curious humanity, Conte gives a read hell-bent on making us experience the nit and grit of rubbing up against the taboos binding human pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
