  <title>Men of Sorrows - Mary-Elizabeth Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Romney Marsh, Kent in the 1700&#39;s - it was sex and drugs and rock &#39;n&#39; roll! The drug is opium, the rock &#39;n&#39; roll is Handel and the sex is - well, the same as it has always been! There are no lawmen, no policemen and ordinary people are taxed on their favourite commodities to finance a succession of costly overseas wars. The time is ripe for any man (or woman) to chance their luck and cross the Channel to bring over untaxed goods from France.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&#39;Men of Sorrows&#39; is a novel based on the true adventures of the Hawkhurst Gang of smugglers - the largest and most successful smuggling gang of their time. Arthur and William Gray are brought up in poverty until Arthur chances upon a smuggling gang and finds his future with them. Beth Stone also joins them - beautiful, high-born Beth whom Arthur has loved all his life. But his brother Will also loves her.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This story of love, comradeship, betrayal and treachery takes place amid the sweeping, eerie beauty of the mysterious Romney Marsh.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
