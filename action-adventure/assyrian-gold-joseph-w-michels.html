  <title>Assyrian Gold - Joseph W. Michels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ASSYRIAN GOLD is the fourth action-thriller novel to feature WILLIAM CHURCH, the freelance recovery specialist previously based in San Francisco. At the urging of his principal client, a New York insurance company, he takes up temporary residence in London. There, he is contacted by a representative of an undisclosed Middle Eastern country anxious to have Church recover a horde of six hundred pieces of priceless ancient Neo-Assyrian gold jewelry looted by militants from an important archaeological site located in a region of the country outside effective government control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church is offered a two million dollar fee for the successful recovery of the jewelry before it can be melted down into gold bullion or before it disappears into the shadowy antiquities market of Europe. Capitalizing on leads developed through a clever use of the internets deep web, Church sets out to intercept the militants before they can dispose of the collection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aided by a small team of Ex-Israeli military intelligence operatives, Church engages in a race against time that takes him from the Middle East to Cyprus and finally to eastern Europe, with deadly exchanges of gunfire all along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
