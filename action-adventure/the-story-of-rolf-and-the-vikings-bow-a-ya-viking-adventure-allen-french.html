  <title>THE STORY OF ROLF AND THE VIKINGS BOW - A YA Viking Adventure - Allen French</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story about Rolf, a youth and son of Hiarandi the Unlucky, who lives in early Christian Iceland during the days when the Icelandic society was transforming from the old Norse religion to Christianity.&lt;br /&gt;
At the urging of his wife, Hiarandi does an unprecedented thing and lights a signal fire on a dangerous point of his land, challenging the accepted custom which places lucrative salvage at higher value than the saving of life. However, the life that is saved that night causes his own death and eventually, the unjust outlawing of his son Rolf.&lt;br /&gt;
Rolf loses first his father, then his property, and finally his freedom to a scheming neighbour. Then he is outlawed from Iceland at the Althing (Council) and travels abroad, meeting with shipwreck, enslavement, Viking berserkers, and many other dangers and adventures.&lt;br /&gt;
All the while, Rolf searches for a way to prove his father was killed unjustly and win back his own property and freedom. Even more difficult, Rolf must end the cycle of enmity, vengeance, and pride that hangs like a curse over his family&lt;br /&gt;
Rolf&amp;#39;s response to the injustice done to him creates a suspenseful, thought-provoking and page-turning tale which is difficult to put down.&lt;br /&gt;
