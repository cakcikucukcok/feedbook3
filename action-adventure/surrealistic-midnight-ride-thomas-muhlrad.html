  <title>Surrealistic Midnight Ride - Thomas Muhlrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Joseph Goodwin desires a woman who despises him. After enduring one rejection after the other in his marital bed, Joseph decides to seek physical satisfaction in the arms of a woman who will do anything to please himas long as he shows her the money.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;When fate causes Joseph to change direction and head to a local club instead, he meets Crystal, a married billionaire who soon promises him a memorable romp in her bedroom. Joseph is practically drooling in anticipationuntil her bogus husband suddenly appears. In a matter of seconds, Joseph realizes he has just been caught, literally with his pants down, in the middle of a corrupt game of blackmail. Con man Brown is armed, dangerous, and hungry for cold hard cash. But Crystal has other ideas. She wants to own Joseph. After she pays off Brown to leave her new lover alone, Crystal sends Joseph on his way. But as Joseph returns home to his wife, he is about to discover that all is never as it seems, especially when lust rules the roost.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this suspenseful tale, one mans journey to seek satisfaction unwittingly leads him down a path lined with danger, blackmail, murder, and wealthy young women who want nothing more than to trade in their comfortable worlds for risk, thrills, and, naturally, pleasure.&lt;/P&gt;" />
