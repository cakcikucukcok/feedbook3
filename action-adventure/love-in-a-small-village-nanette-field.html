  <title>Love in a Small Village - Nanette Field</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Clara Garden is thirty-five and single, with no escape in sight. Just jilted by her fianc, who runs off to Las Vegas to marry his receptionist, shes not sure where to turnuntil a birthday gift from her mother gives Clara an opportunity to escape from Vancouver Island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She travels to England for a tranquil summer at Meadow Vale, a farm house deep in the Warwickshire countryside. Determined to put her failed relationship behind her, Clara anticipates history, culture, custard-covered desserts, and possibly romance as she embarks on her first foreign trip. It should be easy: stay in a beautiful house, walk a dog every day, and feed the ponies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, she finds herself dealing with vaguely disturbing neighbors, a medically fragile Chihuahua, a pregnant pony on the brink of labor, and the fact that the previous three house sitters have met untimely deaths. Drawn into a family feud and local events such as the village fete and a childrens riding competition, Clara becomes known to local police and media before the summers end. Even so, she finds there is life after a broken engagement.&lt;/p&gt;" />
