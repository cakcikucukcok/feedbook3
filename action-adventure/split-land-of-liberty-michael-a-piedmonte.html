  <title>Split Land of Liberty - Michael A. Piedmonte</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Split Land of Liberty&lt;/I&gt; presents a broadbrush black humor look at violence, religion, and sex in America in the middle 1990s.  An escaped convict named Canno is looking for the perfect religion in which to die. For him, this would be one that offers the best deal for eternity.  He reasons that we shop around for such temporary dwellings as houses, condos, and apartments, so why not shop for the place where we might have to spend eternity. As Canno travels across America, he is shocked by all the confrontations and violence he encounters.  However, he soon adapts in a way that he least expects. Cannos quest takes him to such places as San Francisco, Loggersheadville, Las Vegas, New York City, Enfirmo, Bradenton FL, Interstate Highway 95, and the Niukiuke Indian Reservation and Luxury Hotel. The confrontations and violence that Canno encounters include rival Viking biker gangs, loggers and environmentalists, pro-lifers and pro-choicers, cowboys and Indians, liberals and conservatives, smokers and non-smokers, abusive husbands and murderous wives, and many, many more. With a loaded shotgun in his mouth and the law quickly closing in on him, the books conclusion finds Canno deciding about his futureimmediate and long term." />
