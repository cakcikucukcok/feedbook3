  <title>Gift from a Magical Frog - V. Yvonne Korotky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gift From A Magical Frog is about a teenage boy, his family, his dog, his friend and a magical frog he gets to know.  When the frog becomes a talking frog the adventures begin!  The Frog has good ideas and a Great Plan.  On one night the Frog explores inside the house and falls asleep in a remote control truck.  Lessons are learned and eventually the dog gets shorter ears; the magical way, in a magical place.  A crow &quot;pops in&quot; for a short stay and the frog outwits him.  Another character the boy calls &quot;ratty thing&quot; adds more humor to the story.  The Gift from the frog becomes known at the end when the frog reveals his great knowledge and wisdom about people.  After that there is a magical ride that tops any roller coaster ride ever taken.  Hints at the main theme (The Gift) are carried throughout the story.
Although this story is completely fiction, &quot;Gift From A Magical Frog&quot; provides a good &quot;life lesson.&quot;  It is suitable for children, young at heart adults and appropriate for any age!" />
