      <meta name="description" content="The last train of the night rolled out of the station and lumbered down the track.
The platform was deserted, except for a lone man who stood smoking a cigarette and staring off at the train as it vanished into the darkness.
	JANE EDWARDS left because of him. HENRY HERROLD loved her more than 
any woman in the world.  He couldnt offer her a life because he was already married with two beautiful children.  ARLENE was a good mother and wife, and a wonderful homemaker.  Henry was a good man and didnt want to be unfaithful, but Jane was no ordinary woman.
            Life with Jane could have been a wonderful love story, but fate was opposed.  She
Was everything hed wanted in a wife, and Henry was the man shed dreamed of all her life.
            Jane left for Colorado but didnt tell Henry where she was going in the state.
            Henry goes on a hunting trip to Colorado in search of his love.  He is sure she
Didnt stay in Denver, though thats where the train was going when she left Indianapolis.  She lived in Colorado Springs at one time and he knew she had friends there." />
