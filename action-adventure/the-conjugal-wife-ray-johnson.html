  <title>The Conjugal Wife - Ray Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Perhaps the most exhilarating experience in all the world is being in bed with a murderess. Every man who has the opportunity should do so at least once in his lifetime. These were the curious and dangerous thoughts of a man by lust possessed. The man was Dalton Nordstrom, a handsome and engaging man who seemingly had everything life has to offer: the type of man that it is hard to buy a gift for because he appears to have everything already. Lanetta is the intoxicating woman that caused Dalton to think so foolishly, to act with blind abandon.
Like Dalton, Lanetta also has many attributes; the most striking of which is her beauty. But it is impossible for beauty to fully blossom behind prison bars. Is Lanetta really a murderess? The courts say she is, but she claims to be blameless. Lanettas sister, Quilla, believes in her innocence. Quilla is just as beautiful as Lanetta, but cut from a different bolt of cloth: a righteous bolt of fabric, rather than cloth woven with menacing threads of narcotics and robbery. A dangerous triangle is forming, a convicted murderess, a rich businessman and a religious sister. It is difficult to envision anything good coming from this disparate trinity." />
