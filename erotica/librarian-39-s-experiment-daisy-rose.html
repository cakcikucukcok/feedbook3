&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You liked it, didn&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; he asked. His expression was a mixture of amusement and pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re insane!&amp;quot; I exclaimed. Every practical part of my mind screamed for me to leave, but my legs felt like they were made of lead. I couldn&amp;#39;t get up no matter how hard I thought it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Did you like it, Alice?&amp;quot; he asked again, adamant on getting an answer I wasn&amp;#39;t ready to give him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is not okay!&amp;quot; I said. I was still trying to get up to no success. I looked around to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t still being watched. We were. There were people around us who had their eyes glued to us. The table next to ours housed a group of university students and a few table downs was a couple who raised their glasses to me when they saw that they had my attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My face was burning with embarrassment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ignoring my horror and humiliation, he raised his hand to get the attention of the waiter. &amp;quot;They like what they saw, Alice,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hastened to make sure I was properly dressed before the waiter arrived. It was no use. I jumped when the waiter lowered two brimming glasses of beer on our table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Compliments of the table there,&amp;quot; the waiter said, staring at me with a knowing look that sent a shiver down my spine. He&amp;#39;d seen me too. Had everyone seen me? I turned away from him in shame.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Did you enjoy the show, Jonathan?&amp;quot; Damien asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Of course, Sir,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tell Alice here what you thought of her.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She has a beautiful body,&amp;quot; he said without missing a beat. I wondered how the hair on my head hadn&amp;#39;t caught on fire yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You see, Alice. There&amp;#39;s no need to be embarrassed,&amp;quot; Damien turned to me and said, his tone so calm that I couldn&amp;#39;t help but wonder if I was overreacting. Everyone else seemed to be taking it all in stride. Was this normal? Had I been so isolated from society, working in my little cafe in the middle of nowhere, that I couldn&amp;#39;t tell what normal was anymore?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wait. No.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Normal was a nice dinner date and maybe kissing at the apartment door afterwards. Normal is mindless chitchat and mundane conversations about what we did for a living. This was far from normal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t know him enough to let him do all the things he had done to me! I made up my mind to walk away. I&amp;#39;d misunderstood him. He wasn&amp;#39;t the kind gentleman I thought he was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stood up with the full intention to walk straight towards the exit. &amp;quot;Maybe you&amp;#39;ve misunderstood, Damien. I&amp;#39;m not-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thank the men for the beers, Alice,&amp;quot; he interrupted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; My mind was a whirlpool of confusion. My thoughts were jumbled and I couldn&amp;#39;t quite grasp at a sense of normalcy for long enough to decide if I should head to the exit or towards the men to thank them for their generosity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Who sent the beers?&amp;quot; he asked Jonathan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The waiter gestured to a table on my right, where two burly men were still looking at us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Go ahead,&amp;quot; Damien urged." />
