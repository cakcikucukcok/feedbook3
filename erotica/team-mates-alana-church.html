&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mr. Glassman?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He looked up from his notes in the small coach&amp;#39;s office next to the locker room. The practice had gone well, and he was thinking about making another change to the starting lineup. Consuela Barton, a tiny Filipina girl who had been adopted and brought to America by her childless parents, had thrown her body around with reckless abandon. Alan thought she might replace one of the girls on the back line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tabitha Harrington stood in the doorway, Stacie Reynolds looking over her shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What can I do for you, Tabby?&amp;rdquo; He stood up, then frowned. &amp;ldquo;I thought everyone had left.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tabby nodded. &amp;ldquo;We waited until everyone else was gone,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;#39;t want anyone to hear what I had to say to you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I wanted to thank you,&amp;rdquo; she said, voice trembling a little. &amp;ldquo;No teacher has ever stood up for me like you did today. Mr. Walton certainly wouldn&amp;#39;t have.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alan sat on the edge of his desk, putting his eyes nearly level with the redhead. &amp;ldquo;Well, I can&amp;#39;t speak for the rest of the staff. A lot of them are old and set in their ways.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;More like fossilized,&amp;rdquo; said Stacie from her position in the doorway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But I won&amp;#39;t let anyone use your...your sexual orientation as a way to mock you, any more than I would let someone make racist remarks about Jasmine or Consuela.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I know you won&amp;#39;t,&amp;rdquo; said Tabitha. She took another step into the room, then paused for a moment. Alan regretted the fact that his lower body was exposed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#39;s all you need. To get an erection and for these two to see it and report you. He shifted uncomfortably, trying to think of an excuse to quickly usher the two beautiful girls out of his office.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, Tabby moved to his side and hugged him. He could feel her breasts pressing against his arm and her muscled legs were warm at his side. Before he could react she had raised her face and kissed him on the cheek.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thank you,&amp;rdquo; she whispered, her dark blue eyes shining. &amp;ldquo;I mean it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Alan cleared his throat nervously. &amp;ldquo;Tabby, I appreciate your&amp;hellip;gratitude, but this isn&amp;#39;t really appropriate,&amp;rdquo; he stammered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I understand,&amp;rdquo; she said softly, backing away. Although her voice was contrite, he thought he could detect the hint of a smirk in the curve of her lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before he could say anything else, Stacie had entered the office, which was becoming distinctly crowded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s really not fair,&amp;rdquo; she remarked. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m the one who has the hots for you, so why does she get to kiss you first?&amp;rdquo; Shouldering Tabby aside, she stepped into the vee of Alan&amp;#39;s sitting legs, so close he could feel her small, exquisitely formed breasts through the cloth separating them. Leaning forward, she kissed him flush on the mouth, moaning softly. Her mouth opened quickly, her tongue swiping across his lips, as if she was sampling how he tasted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unable to respond, Alan blinked as she pulled away slightly. Gasping, he realized she had her hands on his thighs, her fingers slowly working their way towards his groin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He came to his senses, almost panicking. &amp;ldquo;You have to leave,&amp;rdquo; he hissed. &amp;ldquo;Now.&amp;quot;" />
