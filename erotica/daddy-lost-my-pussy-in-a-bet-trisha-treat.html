  <title>Daddy Lost My Pussy in a Bet - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daddy has a gambling problem, and when he loses at the poker table, it&#39;s either pay up fifty thousand dollars that he doesn&#39;t have...or offer up his 18 year old daughter&#39;s virgin pussy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Well, where is she, John? I don&#39;t have all fucking night. Either bring your whore down here right now, or give me the 50 fucking grand that you owe me. I didn&#39;t come over here to chit chat.&quot; The other man was addressing Daddy, sounding impatient as hell. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Hold your fucking horses. She is probably asleep. Just wait a second while I get things arranged for you.&quot; Daddy sounded frazzled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What the hell was going on? Whore? 50 grand? Daddy must be in way over his head. I never knew he was involved with prostitution too. What could this guy be talking about?&quot; I tried to make sense of the conversation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard heavy footsteps coming up the stairs, and scrambled back into my bed. I saw my doorknob twist through the darkness, and slowly my door creaked open. My heart rate was picking up speed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daddy entered by room and gently shook me awake. &quot;Honey, wake up.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opened my eyes, pretending to just be gaining consciousness. &quot;What is it, Daddy?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daddy looked at me a long moment, and kissed my forehead. &quot;Honey, Daddy brought a friend from the casino home tonight. Do you want to meet him?&quot; He asked me gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stared at him blankly. &quot;What? Why would I want to meet your friend?&quot; I was still confused as to what was happening. &quot;Tell me what is going on,&quot; I pleaded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, Daddy&#39;s face hardened, and he spoke in a no-nonsense voice. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what is going on. Daddy lost a bet tonight, and in a few minutes, Daddy&#39;s friend is going to come up these stairs, and he is going to get into your bed, and then he is going to fuck you. That&#39;s what is going on. Do you understand?&quot;" />
