  <title>My Asian Aunt - Justin Luxure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kyle is an Erotica writer who lives with his Aunt and Uncle. Recently his stories have taken a new direction featuring older Asian women. Kyle is ashamed to admit the inspiration for his new story comes from his Aunt Jun, who is beautiful Asian woman herself. When the insatiable cougar reads a few of his stories without his knowledge it become clear she is the forefront of his fantasies and acts on her own urges leading to shared forbidden lust.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I have a few questions,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Where do you find your inspiration? Do you have someone in mind when you write these?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; I muttered. &amp;ldquo;It is all fiction.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fiction you say? I find that hard to believe because I was reading some of these stories with a sense of d&amp;eacute;j&amp;agrave; vu. Why Asians? Why older women? Why does she where the same clothes as me? Talk the same way?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;hellip; I&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was at a loss for words; nothing could have prepared me for this moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Relax,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m actually flattered.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I remained quiet, still not willing to admit she was the inspiration for these stories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The way you describe me &amp;ndash; or sorry the woman in your story &amp;ndash; is poetic, beautiful and sexy. Do you see me that way? You&amp;rsquo;ve got a thing for older Asian women, that is the forefront of your fantasies isn&amp;rsquo;t it.?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to say,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;Please don&amp;rsquo;t tell my Uncle.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Tell him?&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Of course not, I only wish he looked at me the way you apparently do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aunt Jun stood up from the stool and stood in front of me. Her fingers ran down her tight fitting grey shirt before lifting it up; revealing her blue bra underneath. Throwing it to the side she smiled with her hands placed on her hips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What?&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;Isn&amp;rsquo;t this what you like?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Extending her arms out, she took my laptop from my clutches and placed it on the kitchen island. I stood there weak in the knees with my entire body trembling. Moving in closer to me I could feel her body heat through my shirt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What do you say we give you something worth writing about,&amp;rdquo; she said." />
