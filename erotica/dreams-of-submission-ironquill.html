  <title>Dreams of Submission - IronQuill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At twenty six, with a successful career in advertising sales and a handsome fiancé, Dakota England should be on top of the world. But when unpaid bills start piling up, shes plagued by a series of disturbing dreams. As they begin, Dakota is ordered to appear before the Creditors Protection Bureau, where the unsuspecting young woman is Repossessed by this mysterious organization, and consigned to a lifetime of slavery for unpaid student loans. Shes stripped of her clothes in a humiliating display, then stripped of her name, her identity, her rights and declared legally dead. Shell be known only as TA 1983 until shes sold to a wealthy buyer, just one of many females suffering the same shocking fate.  This is just a dream, isnt it?  But, rather than fading into forgetfulness as dreams should, this nightmare transforms into obsessive real-time fantasies that threaten both her job and her relationship. Her fiancé, Daniel, can make no sense of Dakotas sudden desire to be treated like property. However her new boss, Ian, quickly takes advantage of her fragile state. He introduces her to pixie dust, a powerful aphrodisiac that turns her on so strongly that she can barely control her raging libido, if at all. Soon, shes giving Ian blowjobs just to keep her job. The line between her dream-life and reality begins to blur. As her dream-self endures the trials of forced incarceration, humiliation, punishment and sexual training, her waking self descends further into the sexual surrender shes come to crave. Hooked on dreams and pixie dust, theres seems little Dakota can do to stop her raging lust, or prevent this outrageous nightmare from becoming a reality." />
