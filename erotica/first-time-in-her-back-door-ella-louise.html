  <title>First Time In Her Back Door - Ella Louise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Proper &amp;quot;good girl&amp;quot; Virginia is so inexperienced, she doesn&amp;#39;t know what she wants. All she knows is that sex with her ex-boyfriend was so boring, she craves something new. Something dirty and taboo. Her experienced, bad-boy friend Connor offers to open her eyes (and one of her other holes) to things she&amp;#39;s never dreamed of &amp;ndash; long, hard things, without protection &amp;ndash; as long as she agrees that he&amp;rsquo;s the one in control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Connor shoots a sideways look at me. I&amp;#39;ve known him long enough to tell he&amp;#39;s got an idea, he just isn&amp;#39;t sure whether to share it. It&amp;#39;s the same look he used when we were kids and he suggested that we smoke some pot behind the school after classes let out. I had adamantly refused, for the record, but he did it without me anyway, and was nice enough not to rub it in my face that I had &amp;ldquo;missed out on all the fun.&amp;rdquo; That set the pattern for most of our lives, it seems like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just spit it out,&amp;rdquo; I roll my eyes at him. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;#39;s your genius plan for turning me into a sexed-up trollop?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughs, a grin cracking his face and showing off a row of almost-perfect white teeth, with just a hint of crookedness. I do know that the crookedness is from a solid punch he received when we were seventeen. He claims he was defending some poor, helpless girl from a couple of thuggish jerks, but I have a sneaking suspicion that&amp;rsquo;s a cover story, and he really just took a hard hit during his Tae Kwon Do class.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not a trollop!&amp;rdquo; His face turns more serious, and he gets that look in his eye again, like he can&amp;#39;t decide whether to continue. After a few moments of hesitation, he asks, &amp;ldquo;Do you&amp;hellip; trust me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Of course, what do you mean?&amp;rdquo; I ask, puzzled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I mean&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; he keeps trailing off. I think this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve ever seen him act shy. &amp;ldquo;I could show you. Instead of telling you. Show you what you&amp;#39;re missing.&amp;rdquo;" />
