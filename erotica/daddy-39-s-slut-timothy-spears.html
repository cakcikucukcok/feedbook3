  <title>Daddy&#39;s Slut - Timothy Spears</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
John watched the girls swimming in the water. He knew that he wouldn&amp;#39;t regret installing a swimming pool at the house. His daughter was 18 now and was just settling in to her new womanly form. Her friend Sarah was also 18 and just as lithe and gorgeous as his daughter. They were both brown haired and petite, their small breasts having that perfect pre-gravity form that he loved to look at so much, but where Sarah had blue eyes, his daughter Susan&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
John watched the girls swimming in the water. He knew that he wouldn&amp;#39;t regret installing a swimming pool at the house. His daughter was 18 now and was just settling in to her new womanly form. Her friend Sarah was also 18 and just as lithe and gorgeous as his daughter. They were both brown haired and petite, their small breasts having that perfect pre-gravity form that he loved to look at so much, but where Sarah had blue eyes, his daughter Susan had inherited her mother&amp;#39;s smoldering dark eyes that bordered on black they were so dark.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every time he gazed into them he was reminded of her mother. The bitch that had run off when he&amp;#39;d lost his job last summer, abandoning him jobless with their daughter to look after. Susan really couldn&amp;#39;t understand why her mother had left (not that John had been able to offer a very plausible reason either) but if there was one positive to have come from the experience it was the fact that his relationship with his daughter was closer than ever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Susan had always wished for a swimming pool and when John had managed to find a new job (at double his previous pay!) he decided it was time to grant her wish. He had secretly always dreamed about having a pool and his daughter then one day bringing around a group of nubile young friends to tumble in the water. And today he was certainly being rewarded for his purchase." />
