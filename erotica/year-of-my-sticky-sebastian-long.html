  <title>Year of My Sticky - Sebastian Long</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twenty-eight-year-old Sebastian Long has been called the best actor of his generation. Discovered while performing cheap fight pictures in Morocco, Sebastian wins an Oscar for his breakthrough role in the film Checkmate. His performance is raw, surprising, and powerfula calculated dance with sexual taboo. &lt;p&gt;
But his performance isnt the only contributing factor to the Oscar win. Paramount Pictures helps Sebastian get the Oscar by positioning him in the media as the first gay contender. Sebastians handlers work the gay is hot factor, making Sebastian the new gay it boy. The only problem is that Sebastian is married and is the father of two young children; his wife, Claire, and family are hidden from the media. &lt;p&gt;
Sebastian excels at pretending to be gay off-camera. But gay protest groups discover he is straight, violent, and self-serving. Every film studio wants Sebastian to play a gay role in their next picture. But all of that changes when Sebastian arrives with his wife at the Oscar ceremony and kisses her on international television, triggering Paramount to initiate legal proceedings for breach of contract. These proceedings have a decided impact on Sebastians future career." />
