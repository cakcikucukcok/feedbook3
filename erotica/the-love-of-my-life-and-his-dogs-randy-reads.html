  <title>The Love Of My Life And His Dogs - Randy Reads</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
I thought I cornered the market on tragedy. My mothers dementia, the place I loved closing and the creatures going to the dog pound. Then he showed up, God I wanted to hate him, a smug business man with more money than sense. Cold precise decision making or so I thought. He was shrewd but kind, I didn&amp;#39;t expect that. The more I learned the deeper I fell. Then, I lost his dog. Now I just need him to forgive me and make me his bitch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
I panicked and thought about Darren, his dog in the pound, his only tie to his daughter and I caved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;OK, OK, the dog comes out first,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Alright,&amp;quot; he opened the door and set the little Jack Russel down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There you go Jack, Now it&amp;rsquo;s my turn.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He will run away!&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tony stepped forward and grabbed me by the hips and pulled me to him. &amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;ll be fine.&amp;rdquo; Then he turned me and pushed me against the truck. He groped my body and I felt like I was a teenager in the back seat of some guy&amp;rsquo;s car at the drive-in movie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;There never was much on top here,&amp;quot; he said, feeling&amp;nbsp; my breasts. &amp;quot;So we&amp;rsquo;ll get to the main event.&amp;quot; He grabbed the edge of my skirt and pulled it up. His hand ran around on my hip and buttocks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nasty girl, no underwear, I like that,&amp;quot; he kissed my neck and that wasn&amp;#39;t half bad but then he rubbed my crotch and the reality of what was happening sprung back into my mind, Tony was going to fuck me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I knew you liked me. You&amp;rsquo;re so wet for me,&amp;quot; he breathed and slid his middle finger into my hole. As if, I had just shaved my cootch and ran after a little dog forever and it was sweat, idiot. But there was no point in telling him that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just get it over with,&amp;quot; I said, accepting my fate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;OK, I know you have been probably thinking about this since fifth grade,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jesus Christ let it go already. I closed my eyes, I heard the zipper come down and he told me to lift one leg. I could feel his cock against my pussy rubbing back and forth looking for the hole. The fact that I had no pubic hair and he was right up against my vagina made the contact more stark and unbearable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He crouched to line himself up, and I waited. Jack looked up at me and to the action at my pussy and licked his lips. I swear his mouth quivered. Such a strange reaction. I wish he would bite Tony. The tony found his mark and pushed his cock inside me. With sloppy wet noises he started to pound me and I suddenly felt something else on my inner thigh. Jack had stood up and was between my legs under the dress. Before I could understand he licked me, a square hit to my clit and my legs went week. Jack was nibbling my clit as tony ramed into me. All I could do was moan.&lt;br /&gt;
