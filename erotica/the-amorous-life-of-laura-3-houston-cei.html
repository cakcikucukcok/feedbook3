  <title>The Amorous Life of Laura 3 - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Laura and her son J.R. continue their passionate, incestuous romance and are living together as a couple. She supports his effort to finish college and and fulfill his dream of becoming an Army officer. Laura&amp;#39;s lust for her son grows hotter while he is destined to fulfill his life-long goal. Together they allow their kinkiest fantasies to become realities. The flames in their hearts continue to burn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laura was still the woman of the house and J.R. continued to respect her as such and as Christmas break was approaching she insisted that they take off one weekend to go way together just the two of them. They spent Christmas day with her parents, Blake and Janet, and the following day it was off to Laura&amp;#39;s chosen destination that was to be a reward to her hard-working son. It was to be weekend at Red Hawk Casino near Placerville in northern California. Neither Laura nor J.R. were gamblers at heart, but this was for them a simple getaway where they would unlikely run into a familiar face. It was just what she wanted and what he needed:&amp;nbsp; a change of scene with rest and relaxation. Laura fondly recalled that Christmas break so many years ago when she was a junior in college and had quickly lost all of her clothes in strip poker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Red Hawk and the other tribal casinos in California prefer to call its primary activity as &amp;quot;Indian gaming&amp;quot; instead of gambling so as to be politically correct. The casino has many isles of one cent slot machines where a person could play for a considerable amount of time without being financially devastated. The beautiful scenery along the drive to the casino enhanced the pleasant mood that Laura and J.R. were in and the breathtaking views of the Northern California trees and mountains were setting the stage in their minds for a wonderful time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
J.R.&amp;#39;s character included more than just his handsome Fabian look-alike face and buffed physique; he was growing to be a very mature and intelligent young man. He had come to accept that for all practical purposes he and Laura were &amp;quot;going together.&amp;quot; They were careful with their dialogue in the presence of other persons and did not make any sexually suggestive physical contact in public where they lived, but now on this retreat, they could relax. Both of them felt confident that they had successfully concealed the fact of their sexual relationship with only Blake and Janet knowing their secret of their incest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Laura and J.R. both found the hotel room to be more than adequate with fabulous furniture the most important being a king bed. Being the extremely sensual person that his mother was, J.R. knew that she was well beyond being &amp;quot;ready&amp;quot; to make love. Both of them had been without sex since school started in September thus there was a fiery passion burning in their hearts and they could wait no longer. Although it was wintertime, the room was comfortably heated; mother and son were both anxious to make love but also enjoyed the tender foreplay. As they stood beside the bed Laura looked into the eyes of her towering son who was now standing six feet three with the buffed physique of a Mr. America. She said with a sensual smile, &amp;quot;Undress me, my love.&amp;quot; He proceeded to unzip her dress from the back and with her arms raised he removed it and tossed it aside. There was the sight he had seen and enjoyed gazing at so many times:&amp;nbsp; his beautiful mother in her red satin bikini-like underwear with a bright smile and those big, sparkling brown eyes." />
