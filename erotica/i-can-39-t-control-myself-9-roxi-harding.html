      <meta name="description" content="He had no idea she could look so good&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Little princes. Little brats. First times. Hard and without protection. What more do you need?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;You&amp;#39;re going to need a cold shower after this one!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Max picks up his glass of wine from the table and takes a sip.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Here at his friend Julian&amp;#39;s house, Max always has plenty of food and drink. Even Alexia, Max&amp;#39;s 18-year old stepsister, is on her second plate of food. Julian&amp;#39;s a damn good cook&amp;mdash;everybody thinks so.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Alexia puts some more food in her mouth when Julian turns his attention onto her.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;So Alexia, how&amp;#39;s school?&amp;quot; he asks, and Alexia&amp;#39;s eyes widen as she quickly tries to chew and swallow. Both Julian and Max chuckle.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Um, it&amp;#39;s good,&amp;quot; she says.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;You enjoying being at college? It&amp;#39;s not too hard being away from home?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Nah,&amp;quot; she says, giving her stepbrother a smile. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not bad at all.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Alexia&amp;#39;s a virgin. She&amp;#39;s 18 years old, and while all of her friends have already gone out and popped their cherries, Alexia&amp;#39;s still remains perfectly intact.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;She wants to fix this. She wants to do something about it, and it has to be fast. All she needs to do is just figure out what.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;All right,&amp;quot; Julian says. &amp;quot;I hope you two won&amp;#39;t find me rude, but I&amp;#39;m just going to go grab a shower. It&amp;#39;s been a long day.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh yeah, no worries,&amp;quot; Max says as the three of them get up from the table. &amp;quot;Alexia and I can tidy up here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;So Julian leaves for the bathroom while the other two take the plates from the table into the kitchen. When they deposit them into the sink, Alexia turns around to find her stepbrother standing there, looking at her.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Max!&amp;quot; she says, shocked, putting a hand to her heart. &amp;quot;What are you&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;But her words trail off. Max is looking at his little sister, and she looks back up at him. She can&amp;#39;t pull herself away from his eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Max can&amp;#39;t believe what&amp;#39;s happening.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Alexia is so close to him and he feel rooted to the spot. He knows he should look away but he can&amp;#39;t. He honestly can&amp;#39;t. His arousal is stirring, growing inside of his pants, and all Max can think about is grabbing onto his stepsister, ripping off her clothes, and banging the living daylights out of her." />
