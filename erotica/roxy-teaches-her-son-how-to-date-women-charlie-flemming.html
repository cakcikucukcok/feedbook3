  <title>Roxy Teaches Her Son How to Date Women - Charlie Flemming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Donnie is a shy boy from a poor neighborhood but his mother, Roxy, has a plan. Teach her son how to date real women and build his confidence. Nothing wrong with a mother teacher her son such things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Roxy reached down and tugged on the towel on her ass just slightly so but it was enough for it to just fall to the ground, &amp;ldquo;Whups,&amp;rdquo; she said as if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally on purpose, &amp;ldquo;well, I guess you should be sure to rub everywhere.&amp;rdquo; She suggested.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Donnie knew exactly what she meant as he moved his hands all the way up his mom&amp;rsquo;s legs until they were resting on her juicy ass. He started rubbing them in long, slow, circular motions so that as he stretched her ass cheeks out he could see her tiny asshole peeking out at him for just a moment before hiding away again as he brought her cheeks back in. He had a sudden urge to do something that would have seemed gross to him when he woke up that morning but after cumming all over his mom and making out with her twice, nothing seemed that weird anymore, &amp;ldquo;Hey, mom?&amp;rdquo; He asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roxy, having not had her ass touched by anyone in God knew how many years, practically had her tongue hanging out from the sexual pleasure of it all, but she came out of it for just a moment to say, &amp;ldquo;Yes dear?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Do you sometime massage things with your mouth?&amp;rdquo; Donnie asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roxy was too caught up in the moment the words didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into her brain quite right, &amp;ldquo;Hmm?&amp;rdquo; She said for clarification.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To answer, Donnie suddenly leaned down, pushed her asscheeks apart, put his face in between them and started tonguing his mother&amp;rsquo;s asshole." />
