  <title>Matters Of Size (Interracial Gangbang Erotica) - Trevon Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Janet is on the chopping block at her current company and for the first time in a long while goes for an interview. When she arrives, she meets Durant and Ron, two friendly black men who joke with her before she goes in for her interviews. After what seems like forever, she finishes up her interviews and heads back to the elevator.
She&#39;s not feeling positive in any way and doesn&#39;t think she got the job. Before she boards the elevator, she runs into Durant and Ron again. They head in with her and try to cheer her up. When the building suddenly loses power, Janet and the two big black men are left in the darkened elevator. After a bit of joking around, Durant reveals that his ex dumped him because he was too big.
Janet&#39;s not sure what he&#39;s talking about at first but once she realizes, she brushes him off. In her mind, size doesn&#39;t matter, and most men are around the same average size. Ron and Durant disagree and offer to show Janet the difference. Does she take the offer and get a better understanding of the matters of size?" />
