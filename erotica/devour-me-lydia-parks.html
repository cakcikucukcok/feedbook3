  <title>Devour Me - Lydia Parks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They live in a world swirling in mist and darkness.  .  ..Their mission is to tempt, tease, and seduce as they mesmerize us with their promise of taking our desires to the ultimate limit.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark Obsession&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For three centuries, Benjamin Bartlett&#39;s desire for blood--and for the woman who granted him eternity--has consumed him. But when he discovers a group of four people taking refuge in his home after their van breaks down, he&#39;s immediately drawn to Star Reid--and soon she drives him over the edge in a white-hot lust that won&#39;t be denied.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Blood Lust&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vampire Christopher Marsh has searched for years for the talisman that could make him mortal again and give him the chance to fall in love. On the archeological dig he&#39;s supervising, beautiful professor Nicole Stephenson reminds him daily of what he wants but can&#39;t have. But when he abandons all control and gives in to his explosive desires, his quest takes on more urgency--for he can&#39;t lose the woman he&#39;s been waiting so long for.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Lydia Parks and Addicted.  .  .&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Intense and lushly dark.  .  .Replete with threats lurking in the shadows and sizzling sex between alpha vampires and intelligent heroines, Parks delivers a deliciously engaging bedtime story or erotic paranormal diversion.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt;" />
