  <title>Nichole&#39;s Savage Brother - Rooster Savage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Ten years ago, Nichole and her brother had a steamy affair. Now they are both married. But Nichole&amp;#39;s brother knows passion is still here. Whether his little sis wants it or not. will she fend him off?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Jake watched her round bottom in her brown skirt. His gaze followed from her buttocks, down her thighs and long, perfect legs in high boots. She was wearing pantyhose. He knew she liked pantyhose. And she was wearing white panties. She was always wearing white underwear, he knew that, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jake felt something stirring in his loins. Something forbidden and forgotten, something buried in his memories of that summer so long ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;When was the last time we did it?&amp;rdquo; he asked Nichole all of a sudden. &amp;ldquo;Ten, eleven years ago?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nichole straightened up, her blue eyes - like windows into blue summer sky - suddenly filled with anger. Yes, Jake grinned, you&amp;rsquo;re so lovely when you&amp;rsquo;re angry. She brushed a lock of her blonde hair from her face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We said we&amp;rsquo;re not going to talk about it anymore, Jake,&amp;rdquo; she hissed through her teeth. &amp;ldquo;OK? We were young then and it was fun, but now we&amp;rsquo;re both married and we&amp;rsquo;re not going to talk about it anymore.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jake made two steps towards Nichole.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes were suddenly filled with lust. The room was warm and cozy, and the bed was large, made for a night of good fuck. And he knew that his sister was a good lay. He needed a good fuck. He yearned for her hot cunt to bury his cock into, and fuck her and fuck and fuck, and come and spill his seed deep into her." />
