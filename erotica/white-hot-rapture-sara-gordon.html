  <title>White Hot Rapture - Sara Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What starts off as a fun vacation in the mountains becomes a death trap when Brian and Shayne are trapped by a fierce blizzard. But life always finds a way—and Brian and Shayne discover that the best way to stay warm is also the most fun! Join them as Shayne learns what it’s like to be taken hard, fast, and totally unprotected…over and over again!
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
Shayne snuggled down into their combined sleeping bag, and was glad they’d thought to drag the single bed’s comfortable mattress close to the fire. It was a lot nicer—not to mention warmer—than sleeping across the room. “How long has it been since you’ve ‘done it’?”
“Nearly a week. Normally I stroke myself three or four times every night,” Brian confided. “But the last time I did it was the night before we drove up here. I’ve been wanting to do it again, but I didn’t think you’d want me to.”
Now it was her turn to be surprised. “Why not?”
“Well…” He gestured around the small room with a rueful grin. “Not much privacy here.”
That was true enough. So if he did do it again, or if she tried it herself…they couldn’t help but see each other.
A hot blush flamed across her cheeks.
Suddenly she really wanted to see him masturbating. And if it felt as good as he said, she wanted to try it herself!
She knew, intellectually, how sex was done. The man pushed his rigid thing into the woman’s tight passage, and when he ejaculated…such a bizarre word!...he pumped out the sperm that would create a baby. That’s what he’d do when he stroked himself, and the mere thought of it was making her even hornier. What would it feel like to have that thick creamy sperm pumped deep into her own trembling body?
He would never want to do it with her, of course. He’d never seen her as an attractive female. But even if Brian didn’t want her, someone would, someday. And if she had a baby, so much the better! Then she’d never be alone again.
“Tell me what to do!” she begged, and tore her long nightshirt off with fingers that shook with churning excitement. “I want to feel it, too!”
He sucked in a deep breath when she yanked her lacy panties off and threw them across the room. Why hadn’t he ever seen her standing right beside him?
Well, he saw her now, and the ache was kindling a bone-deep fire in his blood!" />
