  <title>Prom Night Cougar - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Danny&amp;#39;s girlfriend dumped him on prom night, all he wanted to do was slink home with his tail between his legs. But he is picked up by Helen Murphy, a hot teacher who wants revenge on her cheating husband. Watch sparks fly between Danny and his &amp;quot;Prom Night Cougar!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A quick tap at the door to the bathroom, then a voice called. &amp;quot;Danny? I&amp;#39;m getting your clothes now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; he called back. He stifled an urge to cover his groin with his hands. Idiot. She can&amp;#39;t see you through a frosted glass door. Nevertheless, he held still until he heard the door close again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He washed twice, lathering and rinsing as if he could wash away embarrassment by sheer effort, then shampooed his hair for good measure. When he finally got out of the shower, the small room had filled with steam. Drying with a large, fluffy towel, he felt like himself for the first time in hours. Glancing at his phone, which he had set on the sink, he was surprised to find that it was after eleven o&amp;#39;clock. Good. Maybe by the time Helen drops me off, Mom and Dad and Faith will all be in bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then maybe the world would end before Monday morning, so he wouldn&amp;#39;t have to face the jackasses at school.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wrapping the towel around his hips, caught up in his morose thoughts, he opened the door to Helen&amp;#39;s bedroom, expecting nothing more than a tidy heap of borrowed clothes, hopefully close to his size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead he found his teacher in World Mythology and Folklore, nude except for a pair of black stockings, lying on the bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; His voice emerged as a croak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Helen shifted, her thighs rubbing together languorously. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s very simple, Danny.&amp;quot; Her head was propped on one arm, giving him a splendid view of her body. &amp;quot;We both want something. And we can give it to each other.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You want to lose your virginity. Here I am. I want to get back at my scumbag husband, who has been cheating on me for months. Tag,&amp;quot; she smiled. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re it.&amp;quot;" />
