  <title>Ravished By The Turk - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Emily is powerless, her wrists and ankles bound. A young Christian woman in the heart of an Islamic Empire, she has no way to escape.&lt;br /&gt;
Her new Master is the Sultan, an Emperor of all the Turks. He enjoys inflicting pain and pleasure in equal parts, and now Emily is his plaything. She has no choice but to submit to his depraved desires&amp;mdash;and to awaken the passion within her.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
A member of the royal guard forced me to my feet and shoved my arms behind me. Another was tying them together. Yet another was gagging me with a silk scarf, preventing me from protesting. My father looked on in horror as my legs were bound, and I was hoisted over a man&amp;#39;s shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
My father began to wail&amp;mdash;he charged towards these powerful men with an adrenaline-laced will, barreling into them and nearly knocking one over, to my surprise. I let out a muffled cry, though I&amp;#39;m sure that no one heard me. My father was beaten harshly and left among his goods&amp;mdash;they had spared him from death, though the bruises that would form and the loss of his daughter were certainly punishment enough.&lt;br /&gt;
I was carried off, and the locals gazed at me in horror. No one attempted to help, and no matter how much I writhed, I couldn&amp;#39;t loosen the grip that kept me in place. The members of the royal guard were now laughing amongst each other, making lewd remarks that put the fear of God into my heart. I shut my eyes tightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What a beauty, huh? The Sultan sure does have nice taste.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What I wouldn&amp;#39;t give to have my way with her&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Maybe when he&amp;#39;s done with her, he&amp;#39;ll toss her out like the foreign trash she is, and then we can have some fun with her.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s true! After all, most women are only fun the first few times.&amp;quot;" />
