&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A few days later I received a text from Kristen: Charles agreed to everything. He had a few conditions of his own. Talk later. My heart was in my throat and I was distracted for the remainder of the day. Even after a trip to the men&amp;#39;s room to relieve myself, I was still excited.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to guess at Charles&amp;#39; conditions, but it was useless, I had no way of knowing what he&amp;#39;d demand, only what Kristen was already willing to give. What if he wanted something Kristen wasn&amp;#39;t willing to give, one of the things we&amp;#39;d fantasized about? Of course, once he had my wife naked and surrounded by his gang, he could just take whatever he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I drove myself crazy going around and around in my head, only to become aware of my administrative assistant standing in front of my desk and looking at me funny. &amp;quot;Are you alright?&amp;quot; she asked. &amp;quot;You look like something terrible just happened.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just not feeling well,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;Think I&amp;#39;ll go home a little early.&amp;quot; She looked relieved, and helped me pack a briefcase while I admired her look. Another time maybe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sent a text to Kristen but she wasn&amp;#39;t home when I arrived. I searched for any notes she might have written about her conversation with Charles until I finally gave up and settled down to wait for her. My heart was pounding. I was too excited to sit still and so nervous that I found myself walking through the entire house thinking about my wifesurrounded by black menbegging to be usedwhile all I could do was listen to her sobbing her need. I tortured myself thinking about the possibilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t allow it to happen. I had to ask Kristen to stop, but my own need was too much.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kristen came bursting in about an hour later, her arms loaded with packages from an extensive shopping spree. Her face was red and she was out of breath, but obviously happy. &amp;quot;Oh, Will, it&amp;#39;s going to be great. Charles has some unique ideas. Wait until you hear!&amp;quot; Then she was off to put her packages away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I followed her into the bedroommy patience wouldn&amp;#39;t let me wait any longer. Kristen was wound up, putting clothes away, trying them on for me. It looked like she planned on wearing more than usual for our meeting with Charles. She didn&amp;#39;t tell me everything, of course. She might not have known everything but she did know that their clubhouse was an old building somewhere in Oakland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charles planned on playing a version of strip poker with her and three or four guys, and maybe another woman or two. If I insisted on being there, my job would be to play bartender and waiter, or basically a gopher. A gopher as in, &amp;quot;Go for some beer, Will.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No stripping for me. Take it or leave it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were planning this for Friday night, so I had a couple of days to adjust to the idea. The first part of the adjusting was easy. Before she was even done telling me about her upcoming poker game, my wife was on her knees fumbling with my belt." />
