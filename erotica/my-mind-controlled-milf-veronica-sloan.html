  <title>My Mind-Controlled MILF - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Ryan has a magic talisman that makes him irresistible to women. Just one touch and their blood runs hot and their bodies crave a man. But even though Ryan could have any woman in the world, he only has eyes for his mother, a former pinup model, and her beautiful daughters! He knows it&#39;s wrong, but Ryan can&#39;t help using the power of the talisman to claim them, one by one, at the family cookout.
EXCERPT
He raises his hand, and for a second I&#39;m blinded. When the spots fade from my eyes, I see that it&#39;s a golden disc catching the last rays of the sun. The ruby in its center glows with a mesmerizing fire. 
&quot;That is...gorgeous,&quot; I gasp. &quot;Where did you get it?&quot;
&quot;Nowhere very exotic,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s just a few miles from here, actually.&quot;
&quot;Can I hold it?&quot; I ask. I feel like a child, but the urge to run my fingertips over its ornate surface is too compelling to ignore.
&quot;I want you to,&quot; says Ryan. &quot;But here&#39;s the thing. If you touch it, you&#39;ll want me just as badly as I want you.&quot;
I laugh again. I think the beer has definitely gone to my head. &quot;Well how badly do you want me?&quot;
He arches his eyebrows. &quot;I don&#39;t think you can handle that much honesty.&quot;
This is a very strange, very obscene game we&#39;re playing. &quot;I really want to touch it,&quot; I say. &quot;What, is it, like, magic or something? Like voodoo?&quot;
&quot;Not voodoo,&quot; he says. &quot;But yes. It will make you want me.&quot;
&quot;You ply me with a few more beers and massages and you have no idea what I&#39;ll do,&quot; I say. I snatch it out of his fingers. 
It&#39;s hot! It&#39;s so fucking hot! But before I can even register the pain, the flash is gone—no, not gone, but shooting up my arm. It slams into my heart and—and, I don&#39;t know what I feel… It&#39;s like liquid gold is melting down my ribcage and pooling in my panties. I give an involuntary gasp, and for a moment I think I&#39;m going to faint. 
And then it&#39;s like ten-thousand tongues are licking my pussy and my anus all at once.
&quot;Whoa,&quot; I say. My thumb skates over the warm metal. &quot;This is...intense.&quot; The ruby is so bright, so succulent. It&#39;s like a neon strawberry. I have a bizarre urge to suck on it, to kiss it, fondle it. But, no, that would be weird. Very weird.
I hand the amulet back to Ryan. He tucks it back into his jacket. I swallow hard and try to bring the world back into focus, but all its edges have gone soft. And I&#39;m vibrating.
I don&#39;t understand it. All I understand is that my heart is beating like a drum and my breasts are thudding in time. I reach out and brace myself against Ryan&#39;s shoulder, desperate to catch my breath. He catches me in his strong, sailor&#39;s hands, and a rush of warmth passes through his fingers and down my shoulders.
&quot;I feel dizzy,&quot; I say. &quot;Take me outside.&quot;
&quot;We are outside.&quot;
The first fireflies of the evening are winking at us from between the trees. &quot;Take me more outside,&quot; I whisper.
He doesn&#39;t say a word, he just nods and escorts me behind the shed. &quot;No,&quot; I say (I&#39;m almost panting now), &quot;I need to be away from the house. Do you remember that clearing, just beyond the old treehouse?&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; he says.
&quot;Take me there.&quot;
