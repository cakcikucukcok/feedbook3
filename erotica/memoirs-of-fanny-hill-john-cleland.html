  <title>Memoirs of Fanny hill - John Cleland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&amp;mdash;popularly known as Fanny Hill (possibly an anglicisation of the Latin mons veneris, mound of Venus)&amp;mdash;is an erotic novel by English novelist John Cleland first published in London in 1748. Written while the author was in debtors&amp;#39; prison in London, it is considered &amp;quot;the first original English prose pornography, and the first pornography to use the form of the novel&amp;quot;. It is one of the most prosecuted and banned books in history.&lt;br /&gt;
The novel consists of two long letters (which appear as volumes I and II of the original edition) by Frances &amp;quot;Fanny&amp;quot; Hill, a rich Englishwoman in her middle age, who leads a life of contentment with her loving husband Charles and their children, from Fanny to an unnamed acquaintance, identified only as &amp;#39;Madam.&amp;#39; Fanny has been prevailed upon by &amp;#39;Madam&amp;#39; to recount the &amp;#39;scandalous stages&amp;#39; of her earlier life, which she proceeds to do with &amp;#39;stark naked truth&amp;#39; as her governing principle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Volume 3 of the GAEditori series &amp;quot;Erotic Novel&amp;quot;.&lt;/b&gt;" />
