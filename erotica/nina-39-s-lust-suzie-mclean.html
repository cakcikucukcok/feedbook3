  <title>Nina&#39;s Lust - Suzie McLean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nina and Muriel have been best friends forever. Why hasn’t she ever taken a serious look at Muriel’s older brother, Asher, and realized how incredibly sexy he is? And now that she has finally noticed, and can’t think about anything else, how can she cross the slippery line between friend and lover without destroying the deep bond they’ve always shared?
(Includes the exciting series conclusion: Ben finally solves the mystery of the stolen money…and must learn to live with the tragic knowledge that one of his closest friends was not what he claimed to be!)
~~~~~  Excerpt  ~~~~~
It struck Nina suddenly, as she lay watching the pre-dawn sky glide slowly from dusky gray to molten gold, that she hadn’t slept well since the night of the barbeque. And as much as she hated to admit it, there could only be one reason why.
Asher.
Her family had moved from Montana to Florida nine years ago, just after her twelfth birthday. Muriel had become her very first friend, and they’d been inseparable ever since then. She couldn’t remember a time when Asher hadn’t been hanging around nearby, as older brothers so often did—but she’d always thought of him as, well, just a friend. Muriel’s older brother.
All that had changed on the night of Jared’s barbeque. Suddenly, for the very first time, she’d become aware of him as a man—a sexy black-skinned giant who’d stirred her blood to a flashpoint boil when he’d protectively laid his massive hand on her shoulder to warn Jory away.
The shock of it had literally stolen her breath, and the rest of the evening had whipped by in a hazy blur. Every nerve in her body had ached with the need to drag him into some dark corner and attack him!
But when he didn’t feel the same about her…
How could she possibly risk losing the deep, comfortable friendship they’d shared over the past near-decade just because she itched to peel him out of his clothes and impale herself on his lusty big shaft?
She knew it was big, too, because she’d seen him in a swimsuit too many times to miss that vital detail. Big, long, and thick, with a delightful curve that she knew would stroke her right to the core, and give her explosive orgasms.
Was that why she’d bought a new vibrator that matched his provocative shape and dimensions when her old one had finally died?
Why on earth hadn’t she ever really seen him before, and considered the delightful possibilities of taking him as a lover?
She’d been too used to looking at him and just seeing Muriel’s mildly-annoying older brother, she admitted with an edgy sigh. And maybe she’d been afraid that it might destroy the special camaraderie she and Muriel had always shared. True sisters-of-the-heart bonding was rare. She’d walk ten miles over burning coals before she’d allow anything to damage that.
So here she was, caught on the horns of her own personal crisis…and horny as hell because of it. She couldn’t turn back the clock and become not-aware of him again. But if she took matters…and him…into her own clever hands, as Astra had with Jared, she’d probably send him running for the hills. Running and screaming in panic, she concluded with another gusty sigh. And that would ruin things for everyone…" />
