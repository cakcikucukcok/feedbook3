  <title>Dominated By Three Employees - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah believes that she is the boss, totally in control. She has called her three male employees into her office to fire them. But instead, they decide to show her who the boss is and put her in her rightful place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The three hot, alpha male hunks are going to teach her a lesson. They are going to dominate her, all three of them at once, rough, hard and without protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The men exchanged glances and Sarah shifted a little, distributing the weight more evenly on her high heels as she waited for them to say something. No matter what they said, Sarah&amp;#39;s decision could not be changed, but as a leader, Sarah believed in giving everyone a chance to speak their mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was surprised when Richard spoke up. &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Excuse me?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I said no. We won&amp;#39;t leave until you give us our jobs back.&amp;quot; Although Richard spoke for all of them, John and David seemed to be as surprised as Sarah.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah considered his words. Whatever she had expected him to say, this wasn&amp;#39;t it. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m afraid this is not up for debate.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Richard stood up and although Sarah was used to dealing with men who thought that they could frighten her into compliance, he quite literally towered over her and she found that she was glad that there was an armchair between them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t fire us and then offer us recommendations,&amp;quot; he said, nearly spitting out the word, &amp;quot;as if it fixes anything. We want our jobs back, right, guys?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah, that&amp;#39;s right,&amp;quot; John agreed, finally chiming in. David nodded along and they really left Sarah no choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you do not leave, I will have security escort you out,&amp;quot; said Sarah and took a step back towards her desk. Despite their less than satisfactory performance, Sarah had thus far thought them to be reasonable men, but this behavior was clearly out of bounds. Sarah would not let anyone threaten her like this." />
