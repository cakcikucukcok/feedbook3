~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
David would usually leave his office early on Fridays and off they would go to the San Francisco Bay to launch the yacht and head on another trip along the coast of California. He had totally forgotten Evelyn&amp;#39;s words of caution about making it a regular thing to be alone on the love boat with Patricia. Nevertheless, one particular weekend they planned to go to a tourist oriented beach in Baja California. This would be their longest trip to date as they would have to go all the way down along that strip of Mexican land and up through the Gulf of California.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a beautiful summer day as they were sailing and Patricia was relaxing on the deck in sunbathing attire. She was lying on her back on a lounge chair with closed eyes, enjoying the warmth of the sun on her bare skin. David emerged from the cabin below and as he stood gazing down at her, for the first time he noticed that she was gaining weight, or &amp;quot;filling out&amp;quot; might be a better way to describe her physical development. Her breasts were bigger and her legs that already looked pretty good were becoming even more shapely. Her freckled limbs and face and bright red hair made her look evermore enticing. He thought to himself, Yes indeed! She has grown into a very attractive woman. She&amp;#39;s no longer my little girl. She was once my lover. Is that over for sure?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Patricia opened her eyes to see David standing over her and asked, &amp;quot;Is anything wrong, Dad?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nothing at all, sweetheart. I was just admiring your beautiful body.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dad!&amp;quot; she responded as she tried to hold back a smile. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a nice compliment but are you sure you should be saying something like that to me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He paused for a minute as he thought to himself: I want her! Evelyn initiated our sexual contact with her and since her passing, it has been over but now I want to make love to this beautiful, sexy woman. They looked into each others eyes in silence; she was no longer the nave childish girl she had been in high school and she knew what the look in his eyes meant. He broke the silence to say, &amp;quot;Have you forgotten what happened between us many months ago?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Surely, I have not forgotten, Dad, but I thought it was something that we had to let go after all that has happened. Since we lost my Mom, you wife, we have not slept together in the same bed. Even on these trips on this yacht that we have always called the &amp;#39;love boat&amp;#39; we have not even cuddled. It wasn&amp;#39;t planned that way but it happened just the same.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, much has happened,&amp;quot; he responded. &amp;quot;After we grieved, we became engrossed in our work and physical love was not a part of our lives, but something has come over me and that part of the past is something I now want to recapture.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dad, you&amp;#39;re the only man I&amp;#39;ve ever made love to,&amp;quot; she responded as she sat upright. &amp;quot;If you&amp;#39;re making a pass at me now, I have to say that you caught me at the right time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Does that mean you accept?&amp;quot; he asked." />
