  <title>Guilty Pleasure - Lora Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The sizzling new erotic tale from New York Times bestselling author Lora Leigh&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marty Mathews had always known about the secret, forbidden pleasures that the women she had grown up with enjoyed. Women whose husbands or lovers were members of the exclusive &quot;Club,&quot; where they took a selected &quot;third&quot; into their beds.  And there is one man--a dangerous, forbidden man--who is part of this world and who has haunted Marty&#39;s dreams for years.  But she had been the FBI agent assigned to shadow him, making him completely off limits. . .That is until Khalid is cleared and Marty is released from her assignment.  Now, all bets are off. . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beautiful, fierce Marty Mathews is the one woman Khalid hungers for like no other and is the one woman he dare not let himself have.  His past dogs his every step and danger lurks around every corner.  If he wants to keep her safe, he must stay away from her.  But the power of their desire is something they cannot deny--and once Marty is his, Khalid will do whatever it takes to keep her in his bed and in his arms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
