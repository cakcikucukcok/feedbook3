Excerpt from &quot;Sins of the Son&quot;
That Look.
After leaving my father downstairs, in the hotel’s elevator other guests accompanied us. Although we didn’t know any of them, Lilith had to behave herself. As she stood alongside me, I enjoyed seeing the other men subtly try to eye-up the skank without drawing the ire of the woman they were with. Some of the women looked at the harlot with dismay or disapproval. Mom openly sneered at them and they averted their eyes. Then she gave me That Look. I smiled at her, thinking the same thing. I felt just as horny as my mother was. I wanted her as much as she wanted her son. The occupancy didn’t prevent her saying loudly with a guilty giggle, “My ass is still sore from that other day.”
Arriving upstairs, I found we been given adjoining rooms with a connecting door—others didn’t know but we wouldn’t be needing the second room. Entering Lilith’s lair, I took her into my arms and kissed my mother with all the passion she ignited in me. Perhaps it was our close relations, maybe our incestuous bond, or our ample experience but we knew what each wanted. And that was the other, NOW!
“Let’s get skanky,” my angelic demoness said. Son and mother kissed with forbidden pleasure. I held her tight to me, her body conforming to mine. Holding her to me, I forced her back. As one, we ventured further into our room. Against what she expected, instead of turning her toward the bed, I turned so her back faced the long dresser running along the wall with a mirror mounted atop it. I pushed her until she pressed against the dresser.
“Oh god John, I’ve been wanting you all day,” Mom purred. She kissed me with a primal passion and held me to her. I reached down and unzipped her. I peeled the black leather leggings off her. As if she was shedding her second skin, they reluctantly peeled off her body coiling inside-outside. Upon rolling down her hips and passed her ass, I grabbed her. Lifting her, I deposited her onto the dresser’s top. Peeling her second skin further off, she slipped her foot out of her shoe and lifted her left leg to me. I delightfully freed her of her garb. Slipping her foot back into her shoe, she gave me her right leg. I dutifully disrobed her and tossed her snakeskin away.
“You like?” Lilith toyed. I gazed upon my mother. Before me, Mom was wonderfully naked from the waist down. I saw the harlot had foregone wearing panties, exposing her…" />
