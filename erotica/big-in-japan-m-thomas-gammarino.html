  <title>Big in Japan - M. Thomas Gammarino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;From Susie Wong to Madame Butterfly to Miss Saigon: you might think that we&#39;ve had enough of American men adventuring, scoring, and coming undone in the Far East. But you&#39;d be wrong. Gammarino&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Big in Japan&lt;/i&gt; is a shrewd and lively book, sharp-eyed and unsparing in its account of a young American&#39;s good and very bad moments overseas. The writing is wired and the ultimate judgement is merciless. It&#39;s seductive and it&#39;s devastating.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212;PF Kluge, author of &lt;i&gt;Eddie and the Cruisers&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Gone Tomorrow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While playing to lackluster crowds in their hometown of Philadelphia, progressive rock band Agenbite clings to the comforting half-truth that they&#39;re doing better in Japan. When their manager agrees to send them over on a shoestring tour, though, they&#39;re swiftly forced to give up their illusions and return stateside.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All but one of them, that is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brain Tedesco, the band&#39;s obsessive-compulsive nerve center, has fallen in love with a part-time sex worker - the first woman ever to have touched him - and his illusions have only just begun. What ensues is a gritty coming-of-age tale in which Brain, intent on achieving some kind of transcendence, paradoxically (or not so paradoxically) descends into the Hungry Ghost realm of Tokyo&amp;#8217;s underworld. He becomes, in effect, a &lt;i&gt;gaki&lt;/i&gt; - the insatiable creature of Buddhist cosmology - and must learn how to live even as his outsize desires threaten to engulf him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By turns compassionate and ruthless, erotic and grotesque, riotously serious and deadly funny, &lt;i&gt;Big in Japan&lt;/i&gt; is a sparking, gut-wrenching, face-melting debut novel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
