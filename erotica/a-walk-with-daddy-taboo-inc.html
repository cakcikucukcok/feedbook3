  <title>A Walk With Daddy - Taboo, Inc.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daddy and his daughter, Justice, are out for a walk in the woods, but when they stray from the path and Justice gets stung by poison ivy, Daddy has the notion that relieving himself on the afflicted area will help!
Well, when two people are alone in the woods and one of them starts to strip, you know what&#39;s going to happen!  Even better when it&#39;s totally taboo!
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Just then I felt a terrific itching burn in my leg.  &quot;Owwww!&quot; was about the only sound I could muster.
&quot;What is it?&quot; Daddy said, concerned and peering over the back of me from behind.
&quot;I think it&#39;s a nettle or ... Oh, God!&quot;
&quot;What?  What is it?&quot; he asked again with his rough hands on my bare shoulders.
&quot;I think it&#39;s poison ivy!&quot;
&quot;Dammit!&quot; he said snapping his fingers.  &quot;I told you to wear long socks, didn&#39;t I?&quot;
&quot;Daddy this isn&#39;t helping.&quot;
&quot;Well quick, look, there&#39;s a clearing ahead let&#39;s get there and I can have a good look at you.&quot;
We pressed on with haste and I crashed down in the thick meadow-like grass when we were far enough from the old path.
&quot;Where does it hurt?&quot; he asked, looking down on me.
His face seemed silhouetted by the sun and in that moment he could almost have been any tall, dark, handsome stranger.  Even with the pain I couldn&#39;t help but notice how fucking hot my own Daddy was.  It&#39;s crazy, I know, but I guess pain will do strange things to a girl.
&quot;My foot ... my ankle,&quot; I said, wincing and trying to grab at it.
&quot;No, don&#39;t touch it,&quot; he said, gently guiding my hands away.  &quot;We don&#39;t want it to spread or get worse.&quot;
&quot;Well what the hell can we do?&quot;
&quot;I know one trick, but it&#39;s not pretty.&quot;
&quot;Jesus, Daddy, anything!&quot;
&quot;Well I learnt this from my time in the forces, but the best thing for it ... is to urinate on it.&quot;
