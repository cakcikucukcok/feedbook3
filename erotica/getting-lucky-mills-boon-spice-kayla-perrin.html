  <title>Getting Lucky (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Kayla Perrin</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Lucky Annelise may be having the best sex of her life with her new man, but she can&#39;t help noticing her two closest friends and her sister—fresh from very recent, very public breakups—are miserable. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So she does what any good friend would do: plans a girls&#39; weekend in Vegas! In a town that emphasizes hedonism, Lishelle is sorely tempted. Between sensual masseurs and private exotic dancers…how&#39;s a girl to choose? She finally lets her guard down and beds the perfect guy for a no-strings-attached affair—a sexy rapper looking for a good time with no questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Claudia is busy getting her groove on with a younger man who makes her laugh. Even better, he&#39;s eager to please and—much to her delight—wants her to be in control in the bedroom. It&#39;s Samera who hits the jackpot, though, hooking up with a high roller and finishing off the night in his luxury suite.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Rusty has a dark side, and Samera can&#39;t get home to Atlanta—and away from Rusty&#39;s dangerous friends—fast enough. But once the friends return from Sin City, they all receive threatening notes, suggesting someone has been watching them all along. Maybe this time what happened in Vegas won&#39;t stay in Vegas….&lt;/p&gt;
