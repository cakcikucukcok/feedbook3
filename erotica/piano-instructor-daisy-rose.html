  <title>Piano Instructor - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To say that Jane&amp;#39;s first thought upon seeing Mr. Martello was how wonderful it would be if he&amp;#39;d stopped playing the piano and played her instead would be a lie. She was, after all, a perfectly innocent young woman and he was too old for her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was a man of few words, calm and mysterious. She was an open book, spontaneous and free-spirited. Time will handle the rest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The following night at work was awkward. At least it was for me. Mr. Martello seemed to be completely fine with the fact that he was caught making love to me on his balcony by his employee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was probably perfectly fine with it. We had gotten to sleep last night, after multiple more rounds of sex. Talk was... scarce. I had a feeling he was worried that talking would scare me off. As if that would ever happen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I almost didn&amp;#39;t take my fifteen minute break so that I wouldn&amp;#39;t have to talk to Jon, but I had been off my game and had made a few mistakes on the baby grand already. I knew if I continued, I would just make more mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made my way towards Jon, determined to not make things weird, but before I could get to the bar, Mr. Martello grabbed me by the wrist and pulled me into the changing room.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes said everything he wanted to do with me without saying a word. We were stumbling into one of the dressing rooms, the curtains closing behind us." />
