  <title>Amy&#39;s Redemption -  Bj Wane, BJ Wane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On her way to a new job on a Wyoming ranch, Amy Rollins stops at a roadside bar to take a needed break. Deprived of sex for too many weeks, her first glimpse of a tall, rugged cowboy in the parking lot has her creaming her jeans and masturbating in her car.  On the run from the law for over two years, Amy has avoided any personal entanglements.  However, she&#39;s so attracted to the handsome stranger that when she later loses a bet with him over a game of pool, she&#39;s obliged to give him a night of sex. This seems easy enough. However, the sassy, smart-mouthed Amy gets a rude and enlightening surprise when, as soon as the two enter his hotel room, RJ pulls her across his lap for a sound spanking. The humiliation and pain-induced pleasure are more than her senses can resist, and she&#39;s shocked to find herself climaxing with a man for the first time ever! Though RJ&#39;s dominating lovemaking has her yearning for more, she flees in fear in the middle of the night. Thankful to escape the man before she does something stupid, she arrives at Kincaid Ranch only to learn that her new boss is the very same RJ - Rand Kincaid. It&#39;s not long before she&#39;s over RJ&#39;s lap again. However, Even though the spanking has her writhing with pleasure once again, the cautious Amy refuses to sleep with him if he wants her to stay on. Determined to win her over, RJ continues to touch her in intimate ways, and right out in the open! Frustration builds in them both, until a willful act of disobedience earns her a public spanking so hot that Amy finally gives in to the rough cowboy. With RJ in control, she eagerly explores her submissive sexuality; meanwhile the open lifestyle on the ranch leads to sexy threesomes, group sex and more public punishment. However, when strange accidents start happening at Kincaid Ranch, Amy&#39;s alarmed. As the careful deception about her past threatens to unravel and expose her damming secret, she knows it&#39;s time to flee again." />
