  <title>Dazey&#39;s Love Dare - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beautiful Dazey and Mom take Dazey&amp;#39;s four brothers skinny-dipping at a river&amp;hellip;and everyone knows, but won&amp;#39;t say, that Dazey and Mom will both take on all four of the big, muscular dudes. But what happens when Dazey&amp;rsquo;s regular boyfriend shows up unexpectedly? Dazey loves them all!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dazey cares about her boyfriend Stu, but she has a secret desire to spread her legs for her brothers again. Once before, she even persuaded Mom to join her in being serviced by two of her brothers. But this time, the whole family has planned a very special picnic! They go to their favorite skinny-dipping spot and set up a rope swing to drop into the river one at a time in their birthday suits&amp;hellip;even Mom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The family picnic has already turned hot when Stu shows up without warning! He sees Dazey riding cowgirl on one of her brothers. Dazey&amp;rsquo;s embarrassed, Stu&amp;rsquo;s hurt, and her brothers feel bad for him&amp;hellip;but Mom knows about being hurt. She takes Stu in hand&amp;hellip;and mouth! The big, family picnic rolls on!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ooh, I love this!&amp;rdquo; Dazey waded into the river wearing her new bikini, a skimpy string design in glistening navy blue. She was very pretty and had long, straw-blonde hair, deep blue eyes, and pale skin that would not take a tan. With no false modesty, she knew her appearance turned on every straight male who got a look at her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hurry up, everybody!&amp;rdquo; As she turned in the tree-shaded water, her heart began to pound with anticipation. Her family had planned a special afternoon out here in the warmth and humidity of Florida in the autumn. They had come to the rather remote Big Shoals on the Suwannee River. However, none of them had said a word about their intentions out loud. It was expressed in glances, grins, and nudges.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom and Dazey&amp;rsquo;s four brothers, all younger than she was, were still on the river bank in the shade. Adam, Ben, Colt, and Dane were helping Mom but they were also sneaking looks at Dazey with grins that told her they felt the same anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A blaze of adrenaline raced through her. As much as she was anticipating this day at the river, she was a little nervous, too. Dazey never got nervous, but today she was.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;s the water, Daze?&amp;rdquo; Ben, who had a muscular, blocky build, gave her a big grin.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Perfect!&amp;rdquo; Covering up her fears, she swayed her hips back and forth. The deepest part of the river might come up to her neck, but she stayed only knee-deep in the water so her brothers could enjoy the sight of her body. The current was lazy and cool against her legs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another thought nagged at the back of her mind. She had a boyfriend, Stu, who was not a bad guy at all. Somehow, she did not feel that spreading her legs for her brothers was cheating in the normal sense. Then again, she had merely told Stu that her family was getting together for a picnic here because she was not ready to be fully honest with him. That made her feel guilty, given that she was very fond of Stu but could not imagine that he would tolerate a day like this with her family. For now, she put Stu out of her thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dazey had always loved her brothers. She wanted to express that love in ways that society did not accept. Her love was genuine and she felt it deep in her heart for all four of them. For that matter, she had often teased them over the years, walking around the house in her bikinis or miniskirts or just a long T-shirt. She saw their eyes get big as they watched her in their younger years, and now she felt guilty about how she had tortured them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today, she would tease them again, but she would make good on her implied promises. Grinning at Ben, Dazey added shoulder shakes to her hip action to make her boobs sway even more." />
