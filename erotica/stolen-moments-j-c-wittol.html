~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia squeezed her hand. &amp;quot;Go away with me.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Go away with you? What do you mean? Likerun away together?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, silly. I want to take a vacation with you. Just the two of us.&amp;quot; She smiled, and clasped her hands to her chest. &amp;quot;No kids, no jobs, no husbands, and no stress. Just us. Will you do that for me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She found herself nodding, before she thought about it. She loved the idea of a vacation with Cynthia. Nick would have to agree, of course, but he was easy-going, and she didn&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;d refuse her. Jasmine and April might not understand, but she&amp;#39;d work with Nick to craft an explanation for her daughters. She sensed this was important to her girlfriend, and the idea of being alone with Cynthia made her heart pound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A vacation with this sexy woman sounds like fun. A lot of fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cynthia leaned back on the couch, and pulled her on top of her. She laid her head on Cynthia&amp;#39;s chest, and her heartbeat echoed in her ear.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;When?&amp;quot; she asked.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jasmine and April are going to summer camp in about a montharen&amp;#39;t they?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes. They go every year. It&amp;#39;s sponsored by our church, and the girls love it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t we go while they&amp;#39;re away? That way they won&amp;#39;t miss you, and you won&amp;#39;t have to worry about them.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nicole raised her head, and narrowed her eyes. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve been planning this for a while, haven&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A cute blush colored her cheeks. &amp;quot;I spoke with Nick, and he already agreed. He wasn&amp;#39;t comfortable at first, but we talked it through, and he finally surrendered.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wow. This means a lot to you, doesn&amp;#39;t it?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You mean a lot to me. I want to spend more than a night, or a weekend, with my girlfriend.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Cyn, I know it&amp;#39;s not ideal&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stolen moments, Nikki. That&amp;#39;s all we have together. Don&amp;#39;t you want more?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once again, she found herself nodding. Cynthia had a point. When she was seeing Collin, she&amp;#39;d been able to spend several nights a week with him, and a few weekends a month. Cynthia moved closer to her, but they still couldn&amp;#39;t get more than a few nights together. It wasn&amp;#39;t enough timefor either of them." />
