  <title>A Well Trained Pup -  Dominic Ridler, Dominic Ridler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She is unacquainted with Dominance and submission. He&#39;s an experienced master. Meeting at a lifestyle &#39;munch&#39;, the two begin a D/s relationship that is strange to her at first, and yet the submissive role fits her like a glove. When their kinky sex soon turns to talk of &#39;puppy&#39; play, both suddenly explode with desire. As the pair tap into complementary needs that are powerful in them both, their relationship takes off in a new direction. He&#39;ll call her &#39;pup&#39;. She&#39;ll know him only as E., her master. With the intention of turning her into an obedient little puppy, E starts pup on a meticulous training regimen. She&#39;s fitted with a puppy-mask, a tail, and various other accessories, then she&#39;s taught how to eat, drink, fetch just like her canine counterparts. Any disobedience is quickly reprimanded. In addition to her regular duties, pup is trained to for her sexual role. Soon, pleasuring her master becomes her sole pursuit and one she dearly loves. However, when E. takes her to a club where they mingle with other human pets and their owners, pup&#39;s life takes another unexpected turn. She frolics with boy-puppies, is exhibited to strangers, and is given away to other party guests. Though embarrassed to be exposed in public, pup dutifully follows her master&#39;s orders. In time, she becomes the center of attention at a large party of kinky players. Her obedience to E. is unquestioned. But when she has a run-in with a pair of unpleasant guests, it&#39;s a signal of another shift in her evolving puppy life. With her training now complete, E announces that she&#39;ll have a new role with a new master for the next six months, and so her puppy adventures will continue. Puppy play becomes a real time lifestyle for these kinky bdsm players, and a fascinating reading for fans of this unique fetish." />
