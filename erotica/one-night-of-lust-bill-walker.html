  <title>One Night of Lust - Bill Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shannon loves her husband. Their marriage is strong and full of passion, passion that is fueled by Shannon&amp;#39;s active imagination and insatiable libido. But when Shannon has to go on a business trip for a few days, she is left to try to keep her fantasies in check without the relief usually provided by her husband. What is an oversexed woman to do except give into temptation?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second day of the conference was just as long and drawn out as the first. Luckily for Shannon it was over. The conference ended with a dinner that wrapped around 7pm. She did not have to be at the airport until noon the next day. She was excited be finally getting back to her husband and her normal life. She did not want to sit in the hotel room all night. She wanted to let loose and have a drink.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After a quick shower Shannon picked out an outfit to wear to the bar that evening. She had been wearing dressy style clothes during the conference and decided to slum it a bit since it would just be her at a hotel bar. The clothes she picked out made her look sexier than she gave herself credit for. She wore another pair of bikini panties with a matching bra. However, her underwear could not be seen through her outer layer. Her top was a semi-tight tan T-shirt which complimented her olive skin and outlined her large breasts. The shirt was tucked into the waist of tight jeans which hugged her legs and butt. Her feet were encased in her black high heels she had worn to the conference. She normally preferred a pair of boots but these worked. She did not bother to look in the mirror before she left. She was comfortable. Though had she even glanced at herself, she may have realized just how much sex she exuded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shannon rode the elevator down to the lobby. She stepped out and was instantly greeted by the clacking sound of her heels on the tiles beneath her feet. The sound echoed throughout the lobby catching the attention of everyone there. The bar was carpeted and did not allow for such accompaniment to her walking. Shannon took a seat at the bar, ordered a beer, and finally began to relax as thoughts of the conference left her mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A longneck bottle was placed in front of Shannon. She picked it up to take a drink. The cold glass against her palm contrasted with the warmness of the bar air. She raised the bottle to her mouth. The tip pressed against her lips as the chilled liquid flowed into her waiting mouth. Shannon enjoyed the sensation of the beer traveling down her throat and into her stomach as she swallowed it. She placed the bottle back down on the bar. Her eyes were lightly closed while she felt the tension of the past two days begin to leave her neck and shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This cycle of events continued for the next several minutes until the beer was completely gone. Before she had a chance to order her second, another bottle was placed in front of her. Shannon gave the bartender a somewhat bewildered look. He pointed to the other end of the bar. Shannon followed the bartender&amp;#39;s motion and was surprised to see a man sitting at the end of the bar giving her a wave. He was young, she guessed in his early twenties, with short brown hair. He was white skinned with what looked like a decent build on him. He was wearing a black t-shirt, blue jeans, and a sport coat. Shannon was flattered at the thought of this young guy buying her a drink. She was reminded of the same situation back home a couple of days ago. As she always did in cases like this, Shannon waved back with her left hand and drew attention to her wedding ring. The young man shook his head as she turned back to her free beer." />
