  <title>Ashlesha: Part I of Awaken the Stars - Jer Keene, Joy Demorra, Jules Robin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rex Vis Tjin&amp;rsquo;s life has never been normal.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not every kid spent their summer vacations learning tactics on paintball fields, or could strip down a .9mm and put it back together at military-acceptable speed, or had really good instincts for &lt;em&gt;knowing&lt;/em&gt; things&amp;hellip;including when to get out of the line of fire. By the time Rex realized the difference, he didn&amp;rsquo;t care. He&amp;rsquo;s third-eldest of eight kids and they&amp;rsquo;re all nuts, but they love each other. That&amp;rsquo;s the important part.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Four of them go into the military, thinking long-term careers. Then Rex&amp;rsquo;s brother dies in 2005 in Iraq. That&amp;rsquo;s the deal-breaker. Rex bows out after only eight years instead of twenty, and gets to spend the next decade figuring out what to do with the rest of his life. He attended a college he can&amp;rsquo;t remember graduating from. He didn&amp;rsquo;t care; it was just something to fill the empty spaces in his life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Picking up available work through the Department of Defense fills those empty spaces nicely. Rex has a conscience and the ability to say &amp;ldquo;No thanks&amp;rdquo; if he doesn&amp;rsquo;t like a job. He gets to shoot things (or turn them into craters) and the pay is great. Awesome.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;On his 36th birthday, Rex meets a redhead in a bar. He wasn&amp;rsquo;t planning on dating, but sometimes you just fit with someone, and he fits with Euan Ambrus very well.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;His new favorite redhead is also sort-of the reason why 2016 pushes the envelope on what&amp;rsquo;s normal, but Rex figures that if you&amp;rsquo;re going to make an enemy out of an organization within the federal government, it might as well be the one that&amp;rsquo;s been up to sci-fi levels of weird since 1951&lt;/p&gt;" />
