&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Daddy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My eyes are up here,&amp;rdquo; she laughed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sorry, I was a little distracted by the view.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Me too,&amp;rdquo; she ran her tongue over her pink lips. &amp;ldquo;I wish mom wasn&amp;rsquo;t home!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I sure as well wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be under the sink if she wasn&amp;#39;t,&amp;rdquo; he sighed. &amp;ldquo;But she is home and I have to finish fixing this before dinner.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Forget dinner, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of dessert.&amp;rdquo; She gave his cock a squeeze. &amp;ldquo;How about you daddy? You thinking of something sweet to eat?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s up, kitten?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I like when you call me that.&amp;rdquo; Megan pressed herself against him, lifting her leg and rubbing it along his. &amp;ldquo;Like when you make me purr.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The kitchen window was too high for Linda to see Megan fondling him, but if she looked over, she would be able to see Megan&amp;rsquo;s face inches from his.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Megan, did you want something or are you just having fun teasing me?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; she gave him a sly smile. &amp;ldquo;Now that you mention it, I do need something, daddy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; he shook his head. He knew that look. &amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t buy you anything right now, honey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Please daddy?&amp;rdquo; she widened her blue eyes. &amp;ldquo;I just need a pair of new shoes and a dress.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;For what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Kelly and Trish and some of the other girls from school are going to the Palace this weekend. It&amp;rsquo;s their grand opening.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That under-twenty one club?&amp;rdquo; He frowned. &amp;ldquo;Lot of older guys hang there, trying to pick up young girls. Not sure you should be going there.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You already said yes.&amp;rdquo; She grinned. &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t you remember me asking you Monday night?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Monday night.&amp;rdquo; Linda had a business dinner with clients and he and Megan had taken full advantage of the time alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I asked and first you said no, then we started playing and I told you all the naughty things we were going to do and you said yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh,&amp;rdquo; he grinned sheepishly. &amp;ldquo;Now I remember. Fine, but you have plenty of clothes, kitten. You don&amp;rsquo;t need anything new.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But this is a club, daddy!&amp;rdquo; she put her hands out as if that should have been obvious to him. &amp;ldquo;I have to have something new. Something grown up!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Grown up?&amp;rdquo; he repeated and instantly regretted it.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Very grown up,&amp;rdquo; she lowered her voice into a seductive purr. &amp;ldquo;Want to see your little girl all grown up, daddy?&amp;rdquo;" />
