  <title>Casino Cunts - Art Wiederhold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;:DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two bored housewives decide to spice up their lives by &amp;quot;opening&amp;quot; their marriages. If Eva wanted to kiss her and feel her up, Rinna was more than willing to let her do it&amp;mdash;and anything else she wanted...!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;:EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Eva unzipped Rinna&amp;rsquo;s jeans and eased her hand into her panties. She did it kind of timidly. It was the first time she&amp;rsquo;d ever touched another woman&amp;rsquo;s cunt and she wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to do next. Rinna opened her thighs and trembled as Eva&amp;rsquo;s fingers danced gently over her labia and clit. Eva was actually feeling her pussy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And she liked it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rinna undid Eva&amp;rsquo;s jeans and slipped her hand into her panties. She felt something soft and warm and exciting. Eva sighed as Rinna played with her clit. For a long time, both sat there French kissing and playing with each other. Rinna came first and began squirming around. She diddled Eva clit faster until she came, too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That was nice,&amp;rdquo; Eva sighed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Very nice,&amp;rdquo; Rinna agreed as she caught her breath. &amp;ldquo;So, are we girlfriends now?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I think so,&amp;rdquo; Eva said. &amp;ldquo;Now what?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. This is new for me, too,&amp;rdquo; Rinna said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They spotted another car coming. Eva started her car up and they headed home. Neither woman bothered to zip up her jeans and along the way, whenever they stopped at a long traffic light, they kissed and fondled each other. At one point, they drove into a small, dark park and kissed for a long, long time while they made each other come again.&lt;br /&gt;
When Rinna got home, she told Al what had nearly happened. Rinna had been very faithful since they married 20 years ago and it sounded like she was getting &amp;ldquo;the itch&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;If you want to experiment, go ahead,&amp;rdquo; he said. &amp;ldquo;But if you do, I might experiment, too. Are you sure you want to go down that road?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She wrinkled her nose as she thought about it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How about I give you a definite maybe for now?&amp;rdquo; she hedged.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s fair enough. If you do stray, don&amp;rsquo;t lie to me about it. If we keep it all in the open, neither of us will get hurt,&amp;rdquo; Al said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That makes sense,&amp;rdquo; Rinna agreed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eva smiled to herself as she showered that night.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rinna told her that she was very willing to have sex with her. Eva was excited at the idea of getting Rinna into bed, too. But she really wanted to fuck Al more. That&amp;rsquo;s why she told Rinna how she felt about him. Rinna&amp;rsquo;s reaction only encouraged her to go after him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vince seemed to lose interest her altogether lately. He showed no desire at all when she tried to get him to have sex with her. The few times they did it, Vince gave her the old &amp;ldquo;slam-bam, thank you ma&amp;rsquo;am&amp;rdquo; treatment and went to sleep, leaving her still horny and unsatisfied. She felt neglected and alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She decided to turn up the heat on Al to see what would happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A week later, she stopped by to see if Rinna was home. She smiled when Al answered the door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I thought you were at work,&amp;rdquo; she said as he let her in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She had on the same green shorts. Al ogled her legs as she walked to the sofa and sat down. She told him she had hoped to find Rinna at home so they could go shopping together. Al explained that Rinna was at work to cover for another woman who had called in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She smiled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So it&amp;rsquo;s just you and me today, huh?&amp;rdquo;" />
