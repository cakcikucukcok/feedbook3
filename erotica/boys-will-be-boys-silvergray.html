  <title>Boys Will Be Boys - Silvergray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Boys WILL be boys, and when they get horny, many young men will reach for the nearest nubile woman they can find--even if she&amp;#39;s immediate family. All twelve of these stories are straight male-oriented, and all but two are incest...sometimes with an extra helping of family orgy and a tiny bit of bi fun.

&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a single mother, I&amp;#39;d had to be strong-willed to raise two children through their teen years to adulthood. It would have been easier with their father, but I&amp;#39;d had to kick him out when they were younger. I still loved him and missed his strong body and keen mind, but I&amp;#39;d caught him deliberately exposing himself to our daughter Camilla, ordering her to fellate him. I burst in just as she reached for him, open-mouthed... and he had to go. A few threats to call the police and take him for everything we had, and he was out the door and living in Colorado. We divorced soon after.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I later learned he&amp;#39;d approached our son with the same offer first, but Cameron had smacked him in the crotch with his hockey stick. At least Collin was honorable enough to take a definite NO for an answer. Cameron told me, much later, &amp;quot;I was going to take a chunk out of him with my teeth, but I changed my mind. I wasn&amp;#39;t that offended.&amp;quot; We never spoke of it again, though I had to wonder what he meant by that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Camilla grew into a little doll, barely five feet tall, with skin like pink Dalton china and ink-black hair. When she wore skirts, she was a real head-turner. She was a free spirit who would happily have gone nude, I think, and I had to remind her about wearing underpants more than once. I also began to wonder just how willing she&amp;#39;d been back when her Dad had made his &amp;quot;offer.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cameron grew into a bookish version of his father: Tall, muscular without really trying, auburn-haired, and glasses. He was very much his father&amp;#39;s son, though he was more interested in computers, science fiction, and gaming than women until his senior year. Then he started playing football and dating -- a lot. I even saw him eyeing his sister when she was home from college, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure he was sneaking glances at me whenever he could. I was getting as much as I needed from my boyfriends, but it felt nice to be ogled by such a young guy, even if he was my boy." />
