  <title>A Feast for the Eyes Part One: Cold Blooded - A. K. Fagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Black-Eyes.  Creatures who feed off the emotions of humans, and who will go to any lengths to elicit the emotions they desire. If they feed on happiness, all the better for humanity, but too many don&#39;t. Pain, fear, despair - and they&#39;ll take those emotions by any means necessary.  Rika Pearson is of the opinion that Black-Eyes and humanity could get along, if only they had equal rights. However, that changes the night she has her own personal encounter with Black-Eyes and meets Asura. He feeds off shame and pleasure, a palate perfectly suited to taking women against their will. And he grows a sick obsession with Rika after that night - one that will forever change the course of her life.  Attracting the unwanted attentions of a man in power is bad enough - the law does not always come out on your side. But what do you do when you attract a dangerous creature who answers to no one, who cannot be served justice no matter how hard you try?  It&#39;s quite simple, really. Either he dies -  Or you do." />
