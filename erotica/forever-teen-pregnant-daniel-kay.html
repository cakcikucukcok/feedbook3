  <title>Forever Teen Pregnant - Daniel Kay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After ten years, Jenny resumes her incestuous affair with her brother Henry, this time using a magic potion to revert her body back to that of a teenager. When their passions run high and Jenny gets pregnant, the siblings decide to fake their deaths to run away so Jenny can be teen pregnant forever with her brother&amp;#39;s babies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I finally found this,&amp;quot; she said, reaching into her magical bag. &amp;quot;I thought my mom had thrown it out.&amp;quot; She pulls out a fat coil of long red hair, tied with a bow. &amp;quot;Do you remember?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jenny walks to his kitchen and begins pulling more and more stuff from the bag; it&amp;#39;s been charmed to hold far more than it appears able. She pulls a small silver cauldron off the stove and begins mixing ingredients that she adds one-by-one from her bag.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The first time we made love,&amp;quot; she says as she pours in some silvery liquid. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all so clear in my mind. I knew it was what I wanted for the rest of my life, and I knew just as clearly that it could never be. You said then you wished it could always be like this. That I could always be like this. We wished we didn&amp;#39;t have to grow old and drift apart and get married to other people. We knew then this was going to happen. So, that night, I swore I&amp;#39;d do what I could to keep it. Maybe you don&amp;#39;t remember, but after that night, I went in my room and cut off most of my hair.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henry remembered her coming out the morning after they first made love with her long, red hair unskillfully hacked to her shoulders. Although her mother had angrily questioned why Jenny cut it, for some reason, Henry never had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her potion is simmering on the stove top now. Her magic wand is in one hand as she magically stirs the glittering liquid. Her eyes glance over at him, and she sets the wand down to pick up the cord of red hairhair she had cut off years ago, when she still had the body of that fit teenager they both loved. With a slow, deliberate motion, she plucks one golden-red hair from the coil on the counter before her. &amp;quot;This is that hair.&amp;quot; She drops it into the potion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the potion turns coppery, it suddenly occurs to Henry what she&amp;#39;s just made.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shapechanger potion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The potion is difficult to brew, and works for only an hour, but transforms the drinker into any living creature if even only a single hair or feather or tuft of fur is added. And now, Jenny, in her late-twenties has just put in a hair from the first night they made love, when she was still at school and a young, sweet teenager.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jenny pours the liquid into a vial, puts it to her lips and swallows it down completely before Henry can say anything. Her eyes lock on his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As he watches, Jenny starts to change. It&amp;#39;s subtle at first, but then the transformation goes more rapid. She shrinks several inches in height; she&amp;#39;d had an amazing growth spurt after graduating. Her face becomes softer, rounder. Her modern, shoulder length housewife hair grows back to the length it was right before she cut it when she was still a teenager in school, nearly down to her butt. Her womanly curves begin to disappear, her developed breasts reducing several sizes. Her butt tightens, her thighs slim and her tummy flattens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Very soon Henry&amp;#39;s looking at Jenny when she was still a teenager, bright-eyed and young, untainted by the magical war and men and marriage and magic. She&amp;#39;s so young, but so beautiful that Henry aches. This is how he remembers her. They&amp;#39;d made love for summers after that, but this is how she looked that first night, when she had been fierce and eager for him, but shy and timid as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Henry swallows hard, unable to believe she&amp;#39;s done this for him.&amp;nbsp;For both of them.&amp;nbsp;She needs this transformation as much as he does." />
