  <title>Stage Surrender - A.X. Foxx</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He made it sound so simple. All I had to do to get the role was let go. If I could surrender completely, I could have the leading role in the movie instead of the supporting role I was auditioning for.&lt;br /&gt;
I should have known it wasn&amp;#39;t going to be that easy, not when the man on the stage was the famed sex-god, Zach Davis. As an actress, I have done all sorts of things that I was uncomfortable with, including stripping on stage&amp;hellip;but I wasn&amp;#39;t just undressed, I was on my knees, hands behind my back, bound, helpless to do anything but submit.&lt;br /&gt;
This standalone short story is filled with steamy scenes that will have you writhing in pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Is this everybody?&amp;quot; a young man came into the room and looked at us with an expression of immense disappointment. He could at least pretend to be happy to see us.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, there&amp;#39;s like, a hundred more girls lining up because it&amp;#39;s so nice and cool outside,&amp;quot; Lana said, rolling her eyes. &amp;quot;Moron,&amp;quot; she said under her breath, but was loud enough for everyone to hear.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just you six then,&amp;quot; he nodded, unperturbed by her attitude. He sat on the chair and lit a cigarette. &amp;quot;Give me your documents,&amp;quot; he ordered. He was probably used to bad attitude, being in his industry and all.&lt;br /&gt;
Smoke tendrils rose from the corner of his mouth to the ceiling as he gathered our papers. His calm attitude seeped through to all of us and we found ourselves sitting down instead of continuing to fidget and stretch.&lt;br /&gt;
I squirmed uncomfortably in my seat, wondering if he was going to bring up the fact that in the question that asked the role I was auditioning for, I wrote &amp;quot;Supporting&amp;quot; instead of &amp;quot;Lead.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
He paused, looked up straight at me, then reached for the pen in his shirt pocket.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re only looking for the lead actress&amp;#39;s role today, Kendra, so I&amp;#39;m going to change this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wait. What?&amp;quot; I stood up and hurried over to him, just in time to see him draw a line over my answer and writing down &amp;#39;Lead actress&amp;#39; in messy cursive.&lt;br /&gt;
It sounded silly, but the fake smile he gave me only compounded my fears. &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t want to audition, the exit is right there,&amp;quot; he gestured towards the door. He looked as if he would be happy to see me leave.&lt;br /&gt;
I could feel everyone&amp;#39;s eyes on me, daring me to leave. Lana looked curious, but everyone else was expectant. I gulped.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think I&amp;#39;ll stay,&amp;quot; I said, my voice trembling. My legs felt weak as I sat back down, only to be told that we were all going to enter the auditorium together." />
