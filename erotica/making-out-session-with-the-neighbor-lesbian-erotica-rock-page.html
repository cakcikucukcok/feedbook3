  <title>Making Out Session With the Neighbor (Lesbian Erotica) - Rock Page</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Melissa was trying to survive the world of law and she knew that the only way she was going to do that was by working for several hours. It was taking a toll on her love life - though she didn&#39;t have any - because she wanted to go out there and find love.  And as she walked towards her neighbor&#39;s home to ask for a couple of spoons of coffee that morning, Melissa couldn&#39;t help thinking about just how incredible life would have been without having to worry about too much work and finding a girl that she fancied.  She pressed the doorbell and went back to thinking about how she had managed to choke the lie out of her personal life. But when the door was opened, what Melissa saw dropped her jaws on to the floorboards. It was just too darn incredible to discover that her neighbor, Joy, was too darn gorgeous and she was wearing nothing but a thong. Joy didn&#39;t seem shaken by the fact that Melissa had seen her almost naked.   &quot;Well don&#39;t just stand there, come on in.&quot; Joy welcomed her with a smile on her face." />
