  <title>The Perpetual Lover - Alvaro Marin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carlos is a lover of women. He loves them passionately, intensely, and deeply, and he tries to be sincere and tender. He is sensual and caring, generous in his affection and attention, and prone to fall ardently in love. &lt;br /&gt;
His sensual adventures, filled with the pursuit of beauty and every possible hedonistic pleasure, take him to three different countries. In each country, he loses his heart on the perpetual quest for the elusive love of his life. He knows that each woman he romances is ready to be loved, and its up to him to unlock the mystery of her inner heart if he desires access to more.&lt;br /&gt;
But on his lust-fueled quest, he finds an unexpected surprise in an older woman. Has he finally found the one woman he could love forever in this sophisticated and beautiful woman he meets? Is she the woman of his dreams, his fantasies, his hearts desire? Only time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;
The heart wants what the heart wants, and Carlos knows just how far he will go to see his most fervent dreams come true.&lt;/p&gt;" />
