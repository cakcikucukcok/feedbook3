  <title>Dominated By Three Frat-Boys - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Violet is at college. Shy and awkward, she has no experience of the opposite sex. But tonight, she is going to be deprived of her innocence, and it won&amp;#39;t be gentle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Three hot, alpha male fraternity boys have decided to teach her the facts of life. They are going to dominate her, all three of them at once, rough, hard and without protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My train of thought was abruptly stopped by Joe, one of Daniel&amp;#39;s friends. He wasn&amp;#39;t quite as attractive as Daniel, but definitely good-looking - he had a large, muscular frame, twinkling blue eyes, and a mop of soft brown hair that rested atop his head. He yanked me away from Daniel, causing me to let out a worried noise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed - I must&amp;#39;ve sounded pretty ridiculous. I was being pulled into the car, into the backseat. I shifted into the plush leather, trying to get comfortable. Daniel was in the driver&amp;#39;s seat - of course. His other friend, Sam, a lean blond with a snarky mouth, was sat beside him. That left me and Joe all alone in the back. My heart began to race.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The hum of the car, muffled hip-hop music, light conversation between Daniel and Sam - I tuned it all out. Joe was shifting closer and closer to me, and my legs were beginning to tremble with an odd mixture of nerves and desire. I knew what my mother would say - don&amp;#39;t spread your legs for a stranger, no matter what.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Following that all-important rule was going to be difficult tonight, especially if these men were to make advances towards me. Body hot and tingling with anticipation, I allowed Joe to wrap an arm across my shoulders, pulling me into his cologne-tinged warmth. It was certainly not a situation I&amp;#39;d expected to get myself into, but there was no way in hell that I was complaining!" />
