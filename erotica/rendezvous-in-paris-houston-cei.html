      <meta name="description" content="Tom had heard wild stories of public sex in Pigalle, France but chose not to indulge.

~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mama, when this handsome man and I were making love, I had fantasies of Papa. I felt like my very own father was making love to me. I enjoyed it so much that when I came, I almost cried out &amp;#39;Papa.&amp;#39; The problem is that I enjoyed my fantasy and even had a beautiful dream that night about Papa and I together making love. What am I to do?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m glad that we are talking,&amp;rdquo; Danielle said. &amp;ldquo;This can only be a problem if we let it be one. We&amp;#39;ve talked about my past before and I&amp;#39;m pleased that you are okay with it. After being a prostitute in France for many years, nothing about love would shock me. One of my friends came to Pigalle from Spain where incest is legal. When she was in her teens, her father presented her with a gift of very expensive perfume that he knew she had been wanting for some time. She was so happy that she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him on the cheek. He then embraced her tightly and kissed her on the lips and slid his tongue into her mouth. Well, she was no dummy and could see what was going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;From that point on, giving herself up to her father was a regular thing and it was always with a gift. After a few more times of making love to her father, she asked if she could have a little money to buy her own gift. Although they did not call it prostitution, that was basically what it was. She even set a price and he always paid it. Her mother knew what was going on but pretended ignorance. Anyway, getting paid by her father for sex gave her the idea of becoming a whore. She heard about Paris being the city of love so she went there and then to Pigalle where we met and we became friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She periodically returned to Spain to see her family but primarily to see her father. She wanted to thank him for opening the door to her prosperity. She did not charge him any more for sex. They made beautiful love and this time the mother approved. She was proud of her daughter&amp;#39;s success and of course was thrilled with the gifts she brought on each visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;ve told you a little about my being a whore and some of our johns liked me especially because I would listen to them talk about their personal lives. One kind gentleman confessed to me that he enjoyed making love to his daughter more than he did to his wife.&amp;nbsp; Of course, he couldn&amp;#39;t tell his wife that but he told me and felt good about it. So you see, my dear daughter, there is more incest going on than most people could ever imagine. I personally think it&amp;#39;s okay as long as you don&amp;#39;t make babies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;I hope my telling you these things eases your mind about your feelings for your father. Here&amp;#39;s what we can do and see how it plays out. When your father comes home this afternoon, I will tell him that I am tired and will go to bed early. He will think nothing out of the ordinary. After he has gone to sleep, you may come to the bed to take my place...&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Mama!&amp;rdquo; Dominique exclaimed in interrupting. &amp;ldquo;You can&amp;#39;t mean that.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I can, my dear daughter. &amp;ldquo;Before you interrupted, I was going to say that you may take my place beside your father. You may wait in your bedroom in anticipation of a night of love and once he is fast asleep, I will fetch you.&amp;rdquo;" />
