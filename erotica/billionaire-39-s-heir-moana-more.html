  <title>Billionaire&#39;s Heir - Moana More</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book contains Very Naughty Erotica themes of an Alpha Male Billionaire, Older Man/Younger Woman Romance.
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
I had thought we settled everything on Richard’s last, whirlwind visit, but I was wrong. Since he left, our correspondence has been less and less. I realize that he’s a billionaire businessman with all kinds of projects, businesses and ventures to manage. I also know that he travels all over the world, luckily he has a private jet, or otherwise running such an empire would be inconceivable.
I had come home once again and Mom rushed me into the kitchen and said,
“Oh darling, I have a wonderful surprise for you!”
“What?” I asked.
“We’re getting married!” She shouted.
“What!” I said in shock.
“Yes dear and I’m in heaven!” She answered.
She&#39;s in heaven, but what about me?
It was the night before the wedding, Mom’s special day.
The dress was gorgeous. Handmade, yet it fit every curve of MY body perfectly. I stood there in my own room admiring myself in the full length mirror.
Then, suddenly, at the doorway, I heard someone clearing their throat and when I turned, there stood Richard. My jaw dropped.
“Deja’ vu,” he said in that deep voice of his. “Playing dress up again I see.”
