&lt;br /&gt;
Liam Cipher is not used to being in love. Every time he closes his eyes, all he sees is her face. It is maddening, his urge to possess the one woman who would not give him the time of day. He knows he hurt her before, but he wants her back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t help my breathing from growing heavier. &amp;quot;I- I-&amp;quot; I swallowed hard. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here to say goodbye-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stop.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I did with a sharp inhale of surprise, pushing my head up so I could look him in the eye. I wish I hadn&amp;#39;t. I couldn&amp;#39;t hold myself back when he looked at me like that, like I was the only person in the world who meant anything to him, the only person who could make him feel. My stomach clenched, and my knees pressed together, hiding the burning desire there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He leaned close enough to breathe in the scent of my neck, panting from the hot, tense air. I whimpered, my lips shaking again, my fingers clenching next to his around the table&amp;#39;s edge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here to say goodbye,&amp;quot; I repeated, my eyes moist with emotion. My chest was heavy, and it was suddenly hard to breathe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; he whispered hotly, his breath burning my ear and I jerked. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m never letting you go.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And then his lips crashed onto mine so harshly that it stole the air from my lungs. I was addicted, lost in the desperate sensation of his lips on mine, sucking, teasing, tasting my mouth as if he was starved and I was a succulent feast. He wanted all of me, every inch that I was willing to part with. He pulled back and my eyes were wide as I stared at him. My lips ached, and my cheeks felt like they were on fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mr. Ciph-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He dipped down, ravaging my mouth. I could remember when he kissed me like this, taking in my scent like it was his nourishment. I gasped, surprised by the ferocity of his kiss and he took it as an invitation to deepen the kiss, darting his tongue into my mouth to taste me better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He kissed me harder, hotter, deeper, moving his tongue into my mouth heatedly, growling at my whimpers. His fingers linked with mine on the edge of the table, trapping me between his strong arms as he slanted his mouth over mine. Possessive. Aggressive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He had always been able to take what he wanted. But he already had me. He ravaged my mouth, not allowing the reprieve of oxygen. I was growing lightheaded with his kisses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he pulled back, we were both panting, gasping for air. I squeaked, suddenly weak and small, helpless in his presence. My eyes were moist, and my lips felt swollen. I shuddered under him, unable to move and break my gaze from his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mr. Cip-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Wrong again.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I gasped loudly as his kisses trailed down my lips, finding the pulse at my neck. His lips and tongue moved across the pale column and he found the sweet spot there that made me moan. I bit my lower lip, trying to keep the noises inside me. His hand released mine and tangled into my hair, pulling my head back to expose more of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why is it that when I close my eyes, all I see is your face?&amp;quot; He bit into my neck, suckling gentle to leave his mark there. I wanted to pull him closer and push him away all at once, so I settled for the latter because it was the right thing to do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He freed my other hand so he could feel the small of my back and push me to him. I remembered how good it felt to be in his arms, to have him buried between my legs, tasting me and I shook my head again." />
