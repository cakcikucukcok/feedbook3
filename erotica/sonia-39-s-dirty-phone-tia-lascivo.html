  <title>Sonia&#39;s Dirty Phone - Tia Lascivo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A chance encounter leads to a conversation with her husband. To her surprise, Jill discovers something about Luther he&#39;d kept hidden through two decades of marriage. Things happen, they role-play, with Jill making up a wild alter-ego.
As Sonia, she then begins to have some adventures, her husband tagging along.
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Rufus looked at her, turning the comment over. He examined what she’d said, then looked at Sonia, incredulity pursing his lips.
He was still in his clothes. The attire of a man who worked with his hands, his bulk and clothing incongruous in the understated opulence of the city hotel.
“You sure?” he said. “It didn’t look that way back in the bar. The way you came on to me that night…”
“It’s complicated,” said Sonia. “But you can believe me when I say I’ve never been unfaithful to my husband before.”
He was standing with his back to the door. Sonia had opened it up at his knock, then stepped back to invite him in. She was a few paces deeper into the room. About six feet in front of Rufus, the big bed behind her.
Sonia folded her arms beneath her the swell of her bosom while Rufus continued to stare, doubt creasing his brow.
“So how come you’re doing it now?” he asked. “How come you’re cheating?”" />
