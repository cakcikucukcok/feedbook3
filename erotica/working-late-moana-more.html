~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
He knew I was going to be very busy with work, and working long hours, until Thursday afternoon. It’d been 6 months since I had moved in with Nick. A lot’s changed since Grad Night. My job at Callahan and Associates was definitely a world away from college. I’d certainly come up in the world. My life with Nick had been, to that point, well, strange. He was never home, it was almost as if I was living alone in his beautiful house on the hill. He’d given me complete freedom to do as I pleased, maybe too much freedom.
Whatever. It was 9pm on a Friday and I was still at the office, the last one standing, or so I had thought. I did have a chance to do my work, put in my long hours and get a huge amount of it done. I had done the same on Wednesday. But, I was always wet. I had been thinking about him a lot and was wondering if he even noticed me.
The thing was, this man wasn’t Nick.
Now that moment had come, there he was, crouched in front of me, so that his eyes were level with mine. His deep blue, sexy eyes to staring into me. The shock must have been written across my face as he asked in a deep, gentle soothing voice, “You feel the same way, don’t you?”
I nodded, not trusting my own inner voice. I slowly became aware of just how close we were standing towards one another. I could smell his masculine scent and feel the warmth of his deep yet gentle voice above me.
I was about to melt. This gorgeous man with whom I had been working for these last 6 months. Doing his errands, making his calls, changing his appointments, ordering work to be done on his house, more like a compound, etc. There was still time to change my mind about whether I needed to turn around and walk out this door. There was still time to work things out with Nick, despite the fact we hadn’t really talked in months.
Was I about to make the biggest mistake of my life and give myself to this man?
This was not only Nick’s best and oldest friend, but he was also my boss!
