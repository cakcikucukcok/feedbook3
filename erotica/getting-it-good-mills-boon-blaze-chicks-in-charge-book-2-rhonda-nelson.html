  <title>Getting It Good! (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (Chicks in Charge, Book 2) - Rhonda Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Francesca &quot;Frankie&quot; Salvaterra is exactly where she wants to be in life. She is known as the Carnal Contessa, the resident sexpert for CHiC magazine, and her outrageous suggestions for spicing up flavorless sex have propelled her to semistardom.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when the magazine pairs her up with sexy Ross Hartford, aka The Duke of Desire, she knows where she&#39;ll end up–on her back. And she plans to enjoy it….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ross isn&#39;t happy to learn that he&#39;s been set up to give sex advice to thousands of women. There&#39;s only one woman he wants, and he&#39;d like to personally demonstrate just how much he knows. Still, this temporary partnership–in and out of bed–might be exactly what he needs to get Frankie out of his system for good. Only, the more he has her, the more he needs her. And it doesn&#39;t look as if there&#39;s anything temporary about it….&lt;/p&gt;
