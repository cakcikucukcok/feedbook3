  <title>Confessions of an Office Confidant - Samantha Fase</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam joins the workforce as an administration clerk in the heady days before the Wall Street crash of 1987. Being an extremely private person and an A-grade prude, Sam is surprised one day when a colleague asks advice on a particularly sensitive personal matter. Sam is soon the recipient of several such confessions and unwittingly becomes known as the office confidant. Follow Sam over the next decade in which despite several career changes, the confessions keep coming. Sexy, funning, moving, and sometimes sad, Confessions of an Office Confidant is a tribute to my colleagues of Generation X women who began their clerical careers back in the days of big hair and shoulder pads, when Madonna ruled the airwaves and MTV was new to our screens. We called ourselves girlfriends long before the Spice Girls gave us girl power. We knew each other at a time when the Bangles sang about manic Monday and Dolly Parton switched from singer to secretary in 9 to 5. We worked hard and played hard. We fought each other for promotions and cheered when the other girl won. We knew each others secrets but gossiped like crazy. The tales we shared were sexy, sleazy, and salacious. So come! Grab a Chardy or Sav Blanc, find your Barry White on the iPod, and join Sam in a saucy trip down memory lane." />
