  <title>The Adult Version of the Sea Wolf - Anonymous</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this adult version of “The Sea Wolf”... we have attempted to capture the style of the original story... the mood of the characters... and the period of time depicted in the story. A villainous and sadistic Captain... a degenerate crew... and an atmosphere of almost-human bestiality... aboard a ship destined for excitement. When a young man and an amorous and lovely girl are rescued by the mad Captain Wolf Larsen... they are subjected to an inhuman voyage. The reader will find that the story will make him a part of this thrilling adventure. The author has attempted to tell his story in a realistic and natural manner... maintaining the original story-line and still injecting the scenes and acts that were omitted from the original version because of the literary standards of the time. “The Sea Wolf” was a literary standard... and we feel sure that this adult version will enhance it... and bring it up to contemporary standards.
