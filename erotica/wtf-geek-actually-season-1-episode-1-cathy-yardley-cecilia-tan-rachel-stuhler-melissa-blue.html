  <title>WTF (Geek Actually Season 1 Episode 1) - Cathy Yardley, Cecilia Tan, Rachel Stuhler, Melissa Blue</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the 1st episode in the first season of &lt;i&gt;Geek Actually,&lt;/i&gt; a 13-episode serial from Serial Box Publishing. This episode written by Cathy Yardley.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meet your new best girlfriends in this sexy, genre-busting serial that&#39;s all about feminism, friendship, and fandom.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Michelle and Aditi have been friends for ages, but with Michelle as Aditi&#39;s editor for her debut fantasy novel, their relationship is under a bit of strain. Aditi needs to blow off some steam-a hot Tinder date does the trick (and then some). Meanwhile, Taneesha and Elli are both having some job trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Join this tight-knit group of lady geeks as they navigate the ups and downs of their personal and professional lives. Michelle is a hard-nosed fantasy and sci-fi editor used to things going her way. Taneesha is a talented video game programmer used to being the odd (wo)man out. Aditi is a fantasy writer on the verge of her big break. Christina is a rebel on the sidelines of Hollywood. And Elli is a fan-of anything and everything that keeps her from &quot;proper adulting.&quot; They might live far apart, but through the power of the internet and a shared love of all things geek, they are ready to face the world together." />
