  <title>Hot Tub MILF Machine - Kethandra Wilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since Jennifer began coaching her son&amp;rsquo;s swim club, neither of them can deny their mutual attraction. And his teammates keep reminding him of just how sexy their new coach is.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then a hot tub enters their life, one the previous owner swore had magic powers. Even if the tub&amp;rsquo;s magic isn&amp;rsquo;t real, it might be the excuse they need, under a rare moon on a night legendary for its own magic.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her response was a hoarse whisper. His hips wanted to push into that whisper. Instead, he pulled back, or tried before the tub&amp;rsquo;s molded seat stopped him. She felt him shift, moved with him when his hardness eased away from her. She snuggled back close, pinning him against his stomach.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Conner? Am I?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His voice was tight, close to her ear. It sounded like he was clenching his jaw, full of tension. &amp;quot;Are you what, Mom?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Am I a MILF?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Uhh!&amp;quot; She felt his body twitch, deep, involuntary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know...am I still attractive, do you think?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Um. Ah. Attractive? Mom, you&amp;#39;re beautiful.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fingers found his hands, pulled them apart. She pushed up, floating off his lap. She could almost hear his relief. &amp;quot;Thank you, baby. That&amp;#39;s nice.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She turned in the water to face him. &amp;quot;But it is not at all what I asked you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moving close, she straddled her surprised son, kneeling on the molded bench. One hand to each side of his head on the edge of the tub, she sank down, again feeling his stiff shape, this time between her legs. This time she faced him, looking down into his upturned, nervous face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His eyes widened when she moved her hips, easing back and forward on him. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay. I take it as a compliment.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You...do?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh yes.&amp;quot; She ground down on him, only two layers of soaked paper-thin nylon separating the son from the mother who bore him. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s nice you think I&amp;#39;m beautiful.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She relished the change to his face, keeping him off balance. &amp;quot;But I do want an answer.&amp;quot; Back. Forward. She saw his breath catch, his eyes drop to her chest, two small rises pushing hard against the wet black fabric, almost level with his lips. She smiled when he looked back up, knew he&amp;#39;d been caught again. Caught hard, and caught staring. &amp;quot;Do you think I&amp;#39;m attractive? Not beautiful, but attractive.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She sat down harder on him as she paused, seating his length firmly into the soft groove between her thighs. She couldn&amp;#39;t prevent the bite down into her lower lip at the growing warm pressure there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, Mom. You look - you are - very attractive.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She smiled. Wriggled her hips on him. &amp;quot;Yeah? Your mom&amp;#39;s a MILF?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Mom!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Please. We can blame the magic hot tub, and a magic night. It&amp;#39;s Halloween and the moon is full. What better time to blame a magic MILF machine hot tub?&amp;quot; She straightened her back, knowing it displayed her chest for him, then leaned down to softly peck his lips. &amp;quot;Just for tonight, just in the magic waters, once under a blue moon, tell your mom she&amp;#39;s a MILF. Please.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His hips bucked, a small almost controlled motion, almost stopped in time. But she felt it. Her lips hovered near, her eyes searched his, waiting. The lower lip, the pouter, began a slow movement outward. He crumbled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, Mom. You are a MILF.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She beamed at him, gave his lips another quick peck. &amp;quot;See, that wasn&amp;#39;t so hard.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two mouths made matched O&amp;#39;s at the unintended but too obvious pun. Her hips moved on him as she whispered, repeated. &amp;quot;So hard.&amp;quot;" />
