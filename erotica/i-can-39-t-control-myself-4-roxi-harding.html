Here&#39;s 21 hot stories for you! They&#39;re chock-full of little brats losing it for the first time! That prince of the house doesn&#39;t know when to quit!
You&#39;ll need a cold shower after this!
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
Owen breathes a sigh of boredom as he stands next to Addison, his 18-year old stepsister. They&#39;re in the laundry room together and Owen is currently sorting through colors, separating out the articles of clothing so they can be washed correctly.
Addison hums a tune as she goes about her business inside this cramped space with her stepbrother. She isn&#39;t sure how the two of them managed to convince each other to work together today -- this room is pretty tiny -- but she doesn&#39;t mind. In fact, she&#39;d take any excuse to bump up close to her stepbrother over and over again.
All Owen has been able to think about all day is Addison. It&#39;s hot out and all the blood is running down to his groin, making him hard more often than not. Besides that, Addison&#39;s just turned 18 and it&#39;s almost like this age flicked a switch on inside of her. She&#39;s become more sexual, more flirty, but more shy as well. The forbidden fruit.
&quot;Hey Owen?&quot; Addison asks. &quot;Do you might giving my shoulders a bit of a rub? They&#39;re kind of stiff.&quot;
&quot;Sure,&quot; Owen replies, and he steps up behind his little sister, massaging the muscles beside her neck.
Addison moans, closing her eyes at the wonderful feeling. Her stepbrother&#39;s hands are like magic. After a few minutes she turns around and he lets go of her. She looks up into his eyes.
&quot;That was great, thank you,&quot; she says in a sultry voice. Owen doesn&#39;t look away from her stare.
&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; he says, and Addison smiles at him.
Confusion racks Owen&#39;s brain as he thinks about his stepsister.
She just looks so hot, and she&#39;s so smart and kind…what guy wouldn&#39;t want her? But he&#39;s her stepbrother. He can&#39;t be thinking this way. It&#39;s a violation of…something. Trust or something like that. Besides, he&#39;s certain that these thoughts are all one-sided. There&#39;s no way she&#39;d even consider hooking up with a guy like him.
…Right?
&quot;Wow,&quot; Owen says. Now that he&#39;s this close up to his stepsister he can&#39;t seem to stop from getting hard.
&quot;What is it, Owen?&quot; Addison asks him.
Owen cocks his head to the side. &quot;Well,&quot; he says, &quot;it&#39;s just that having you here during the day…I&#39;ve just been thinking bad thoughts.&quot;
Addison&#39;s mouth opens a little bit as she looks at him.
&quot;Bad thoughts?&quot; she asks, and now Owen looks at her. They&#39;re locked together in each other&#39;s gaze.
&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; he says to her. &quot;Bad thoughts.&quot;" />
