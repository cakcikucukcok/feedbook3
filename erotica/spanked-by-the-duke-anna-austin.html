  <title>Spanked By The Duke - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Annabel&amp;#39;s father has gambled away her innocence, wagering her virtue on a hand of cards. Now she must make good his sinful wager and prepare herself for one night of total submission.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lucky winner is the Duke of Lighthorne, a man who likes to inflict pain as much as he revels in giving pleasure. Annabel soon finds herself on the receiving end of his firm discipline.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Annabel, I gambled again.&amp;quot; My father mumbled. This was no surprise to me - I had assumed that he&amp;#39;d done so, judging by the look on his face. &amp;quot;But this time...I owe somebody something far more precious than any heirloom we may own.&amp;quot; He spoke, his voice as tense as his faces as he finally turned to meet my gaze.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My heart skipped a beat - I knew not what he meant. Perhaps he&amp;#39;d gambled away our entire manor? My body was crumbling under the suspense, and as quietly as I could, I urged him to continue. I wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I gambled with a man of great power tonight. A Duke, as a matter of fact. I was trying my best to get as much money as I could out of him, but-&amp;quot; My father said quietly, as if stating what he&amp;#39;d done aloud made it more real somehow. &amp;quot;That man - he was one hell of a poker player. In the end, our bets were so high that I knew I couldn&amp;#39;t possibly repay him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My heart sank - perhaps we were to sell our manor after all. It was a good thing that I had been friendly to our neighbours all these years - perhaps they would grant us permission to stay with them, however long we may need it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Annabel, I-&amp;quot; came my father&amp;#39;s voice as he choked back sobs. I was horrified - I didn&amp;#39;t remember ever having seen my father cry, save for at my mother&amp;#39;s funeral. I wrapped an arm around him comfortingly, regretting my decision to let him travel into the city today. &amp;quot;Annabel, he wanted you.&amp;quot;" />
