&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She lay upon the muddy shore, her eyes twinkling like the water. Green tears dripped from her cheeks and beaded slowly into her bosom. The sight of her took Dru&amp;#39;s breath away.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her legs were long and bare, her feet untouched by the muck and mire that surrounded her. Her individual toes were topped by small, perfect toenails, unblemished and unbruised by the hard labor that discolored human skin. Her hands were buried in the mud, the green tendrils of her hair writhing over her face. Her body shook from the intensity of her sobs. Her curves jiggled. With every gasp, her large breasts rolled like jelly tarts. Her thighs rippled like the cesspool she was born in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was a young man, and she was everything he&amp;#39;d dreamed of.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His hand fell from his sword. He licked his lips, still tasted blood when he swallowed. And her slime. It was not poison, like the water of the bog, but reminiscent of pine and white water lilies. &amp;quot;Why are you crying?&amp;quot; he whispered. Her thick hair flew back from her face. Her big eyes grew bigger still. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t know...that you cried,&amp;quot; Dru said. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know anything about this place,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;About anything.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The slime girl hesitated at the water&amp;#39;s edge, her wet eyes studying him intently. Would she slither back into the swamp? Would she attack? Dru didn&amp;#39;t know. He could only stare at the beautiful thing, the naked body he craved to touch again. &amp;quot;You?&amp;quot; she said quietly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know I&amp;#39;m an idiot for coming back here,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just...are you lonely?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hand over hand, she crawled from the shore. Her knees flattened the cold mud and her toes dug ten round divots behind her. Cautiously, she climbed to her feet. Her nose was level with his chest but her hair rose higher, thicker, twisting like the tails of clear, wet snakes. Her green fingers touched his chest. Her big eyes stared up at him. &amp;quot;Are you lonely?&amp;quot; she asked.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Gods,&amp;quot; he groaned. &amp;quot;I am. I am.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am,&amp;quot; she echoed, sliding her hands through his arms. He let his fingers slide down her wet backside, to the warm and bubbly posterior. She molded around him like jam, suctioning to him. Dru grunted in surprise, and the slime went up on her toes to kiss his open mouth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That taste, he thought. Nothing at all like the foulness that surrounded them. She was life itself. He did not know if she had a mind as he did, but he could feel the yearning in her trembling form. Her lips slimed down his neck, her tongue lapping at his nervous perspiration. Yes, she hungered for his moisture. Any moisture..." />
