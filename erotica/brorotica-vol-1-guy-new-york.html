  <title>Brorotica Vol.1 - Guy New York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes being super straight is a little gay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Brorotica is a collection of five short stories about straight men who find themselves drawn to each other in unexpected ways. From a football game to the boardroom, each story explores what often goes on in typically masculine spaces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the story Brotastic a friend asks his buddy a simple question: what&amp;#39;s it like to be with a dude? Luckily it doesn&amp;#39;t take much for him to find out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Branding 101 we follow a marketing director who is frustrated with his company&amp;#39;s inability to present themselves professionally. When he gets called into his bosses office for a scolding, he turns the tables around and shows him what it really takes to succeed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Beer Pong, two young men find themselves in Hoboken with a couple of girls who know how to push their boundaries. As they try to impress their new friends, the boys get closer and closer until they pass everyone&amp;#39;s expectations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Football brings two buddies together for some afternoon fun in the park. But when they head back home for some beers, it turns out that one of them has a bit of a crush on the other&amp;#39;s wife. To complicated matters, they throw on a porn movie and discover that jealousy and desire make good bedfellows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And finally, A Letter finds our narrator writing to an old friend about an afternoon they shared years ago. A hot shower, a cold rain, and unspoken desires lead to something neither of them can forget.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each story contains explicit sex and intended for an adult audience. The book is 10,000 words long.&lt;br /&gt;
