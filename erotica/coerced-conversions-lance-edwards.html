  <title>Coerced Conversions - Lance Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lance Edwards brings us another stunning collection of Femdom short stories with Coerced Conversions. In The Snore Cure, we find a couple freshly married but the new bride is highly annoyed with her groom&#39;s snoring. She takes matters into her own hands to cure him of this nasty habit with a few tools from her best friend. Every young guys dream is to land a Cougar, but Andy has no idea what he&#39;s in for when Dana drags him to her home after picking him up in a local bar. She discovers he&#39;s a virgin &quot;in both holes&quot; and decides that she&#39;ll deflower this wimpy geek and he&#39;ll learn to love it. In Second Chances, Tad reacquaints himself with his high school crush at a reunion. In a wheelchair, Tad is stunned to discover that Donna rather likes the idea of him being helpless, and a virgin to boot. She discovers all sorts of devious ways to torture him with his medical devices once she comes to his house. Captured at the Camp is the story of two drunken best friends that are the stars of the local high school football team. Eighteen, full of testosterone and beer, Jerry and Jack make their way to a camp where the college women&#39;s soccer team is supposedly having a sinful all-girl orgy. The boys get caught and wicked things happen at the hands of the captain and her teammates. Coerced Conversions is definitely an example of what Lance Edwards does best, bringing the excruciating pain and endless excitement of Femdom to our readers" />
