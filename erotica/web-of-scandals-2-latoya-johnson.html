  <title>Web of Scandals 2 - Latoya Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Melanies mother was strict on her growing up, hoping her daughter would not follow in the footsteps of her older sister. She tried her best to raise her well, and keep her from them no good boys. Being strict on Melanie only backfired, and once she turned eighteen, her life began to spiral out of control. Melanie wasnt good at picking men, and that only caused pain, hurt, and sadness throughout her life. Every time she meets a man, hes always the one, and then he gets her into some type of trouble. How could a beautiful young woman grow up and go through so much as Melanie did. Life just wasnt fair for her.
Then enters Maceo into her life. He was different and like no other man shes ever met. Maceo instantly falls in love with the beautiful Melanie and promised to change his life for her and the kids. What he fails to realize is, that his life will never change and forever haunt him because of the family business. They both want to be perfect for each other but the past is not finish with them. They need help and that one person to help them will be risking his life to come back out of hiding. How is Malcom Jamison mixed up in Melanie and Maceos relationship?" />
