  <title>Dominated By Three Doctors - Virginia Bliss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rose thinks she is at the medical center for a routine check-up. But her doctor has decided to give her a more thorough examination, and she won&amp;#39;t be needing her clothes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The three hot alpha-male doctors have decided to give all of her cavities a good probing. They are going to dominate her, all three of them at once--rough, hard, and without protection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These bi-monthly checkups never seemed to have any purpose, seeing as I was a woman in good health. However, my insurance covered them, so there was no point in turning them down - better to take a couple of hours out of my day and make sure my insides were still working smoothly than to develop an illness and find out months later.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My mother had made that mistake - diagnosed when it was almost too late. Thankfully, her condition was starting to improve, but I would forever be haunted by that one little laziness-induced slip-up. I had a number already - 21, but it was taking forever. Patient 20 had gone into the doctor&amp;#39;s office, but had yet to come back out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;I clicked my heels against the tiled floors, wishing I were anywhere else. Really, these meetings usually lasted under ten minutes, and the fact that it always took me upwards of thirty minutes to drive here from work made the whole thing seem completely redundant. I furrowed my brows - well, I supposed I should resign myself to looking on the bright side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My doctor - who had asked me rather early on to simply refer to him as &amp;#39;Michael&amp;#39;, was unnecessarily attractive. He was perhaps the only saving grace of this boring appointments. I knew that nothing would ever develop between the two of us, but the fantasies I&amp;#39;d formed in my head were what usually got me through the sessions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was tall - I only came up to his shoulders. His hair was dark, thick, wavy - I wanted to run my hands through it more than I&amp;#39;d ever wanted anything. His eyes, in contrast to his hair, were very light - a shade of grey I&amp;#39;d never seen held within anyone else&amp;#39;s irises. He was far too handsome to be a doctor, it was almost a waste of his looks." />
