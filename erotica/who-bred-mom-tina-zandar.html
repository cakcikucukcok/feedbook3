  <title>Who Bred Mom? - Tina Zandar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Who knocked up Susan? Her husband&amp;#39;s boss who caused her to climax? The boss&amp;#39;s sweet, but expert teen son whom she felt sorry for and invited into her bed? Her own son, to whom she surrendered after his plea for just &amp;#39;one time&amp;#39; in her arms? Or her slutty daughter&amp;#39;s virgin fianc&amp;eacute; who was clueless until Susan lovingly deflowered him and changed her own life forever.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
He sheds his shorts and advances between my thighs. He&amp;#39;s erect. He&amp;#39;s ready to invade my womanhood. I&amp;#39;m moist, so it probably won&amp;#39;t be painful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My God, how can I continue to like a man who is about to degrade me?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I raise my legs. If I&amp;#39;m about to be violated I can at least make it comfortable for myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is happening?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of his prong invading my cunt, I see his head dip down out of sight and sense his lips covering my shaved pussy with kisses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I hear him making appreciative sounds. Oh, God, what is he going to do?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My pussy has never been kissed before. I think it is disgusting; so does my husband, Scott.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shit! It tickles. I want to giggle. I try to evade his lips. But to where?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
God, please save me... God, make somebody open the door and see us, interrupt this rape...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NO! I silently scream when his tongue begins to lap at my pussy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then and even louder silent scream when his tongue ventures into my crack.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I want to push him away. One of my hands comes to rest on the back of his head. I&amp;#39;m strangely powerless to shove him away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I realize what is next and every part of me -- except my hand -- recoils.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No, Susan! No matter what, you MUST stop him before he...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it is too late.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I think I emit a yelp. I think I gulp a mouthful of air. I&amp;#39;m not sure...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The reason I&amp;#39;m not sure is that the tip of his tongue has momentarily touched my clit, causing a shut-down of virtually all common sense. I&amp;#39;m paralyzed with fear that my love bud has been awakened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Until this very moment I had ignored that small nubbin of flesh buried in my pussy, assuming that Guido would by-pass it, mainly intent on plunging his stick into my unwilling cunt. What self-respecting rapist ever thinks about a sleeping clit?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would plead with God to disconnect my clit, but he or she probably has more important tasks at hand. Is there anything I can do? Not likely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Guido soon takes the decision out of my hands with a second, slower pass at my clit. I regretfully acknowledge that it is all downhill from here. All I can do is valiantly attempt to minimize the damage the Italian is about to inflict on me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;s thoughtful. He doesn&amp;#39;t rush things. That in itself is a problem. If only he&amp;#39;d get down to business and get it over with! Instead, I soon realize that he is going to humiliate me to the greatest degree a woman can be shamed, degraded. That is, make me climax while being raped.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As there is no escape, no recourse, I decide to surrender.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happens first? First I realize that my cunt is sodden. Sodden! Lubrication must be flowing out of it like rampaging river. And what does a soaking wet cunt need?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, it wouldn&amp;#39;t be wet unless it wanted, and expected, a hard cock to be inserted. Soon. So the result is a wet, aching, disappointed cunt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then there are the humiliating sound effects. Although I somehow refrain from shouting, &amp;quot;Fuck me for Christ&amp;#39;s sake&amp;#39; I can&amp;#39;t stop a plaintive cry for relief." />
