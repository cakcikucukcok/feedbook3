~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a typical Friday in September when Barbara Ann would play bridge with her friends while Melvin and Mary Lou would go out alone together. This had been going on for several months and all three of them felt that it enhanced their sexual relationship. Before parting company, Marvin read to his wife and daughter the letter from Billy Joe the other member the family. He would be coming home on furlough for 30 days from the U.S. Army. He had volunteered for Airborne and had finishing his seemingly endless and rigorous taring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll bet he felt like he was the proudest man alive,&amp;quot; Marvin said. &amp;quot;Airborne has a lot of dropouts who just can&amp;#39;t cut it. I&amp;#39;m proud of my son.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Dad, are we going to share with him our business arrangement? Mom, do you think you&amp;#39;re gonna get to do stuff with him again?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Leave it to our daughter to be the first one to bring up the subject of sex,&amp;quot; Barbara Ann said. &amp;quot;He maybe a whole new man now, different in ways we don&amp;#39;t even know yet. We&amp;#39;ll have to take it as it comes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After Barbara Ann left the house, Mary Lou and her father were sitting on the love seat. &amp;quot;Dad, I&amp;#39;m looking forward to seeing Billy Joe, but right now I&amp;#39;m just thinking about you. I love these evenings when we are alone for the whole night and will wake up together in the morning.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Likewise, I look forward to these times together alone with you, and we are so fortunate to have your mother&amp;#39;s blessing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Father and daughter each parted to separate rooms to dress for the evening. When Mary Lou emerged from her room, she found her father sitting on the love seat well attired in one of his best camel hair sports coats with a white shirt and tie, wool slacks and fashion shoes. The sexy couple always went out with flair on their special Friday nights and this was no exception. She stood before him in a tight one-piece dress that contoured her shapely body to a tee and also betrayed an exceptional amount of breast cleavage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do ya think, Dad,&amp;quot; she said in reference to herself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Baby, you are beautiful as ever.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You ain&amp;#39;t seen nothin&amp;#39; yet,&amp;quot; and then spun around to show that her dress was backless to the point of showing at least two inches of butt cleavage. After giving her father a few seconds to look, she turned to face him with a smile.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Baby, everyone is going to see part of your butt.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the way it&amp;#39;s supposed to be,&amp;quot; she said and then lifted the tiny skirt to shoo that she was not wearing panties. It was obvious to Marvin why.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shook his head with a smile and off they went. This sexy father and daughter had been out on the town many times dancing, skating and but this time it was to dinner and the theater. They enjoyed splurging at the high end dinner house they had frequented and then to see a romantic play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dinner by candlelight with a roaring minstrel playing soft melodies on the violin was about as romantic of a setting as anyone could ask for. After they were finished dining, Mary Lou took hold of her father&amp;#39;s hand to place it on her bare thigh." />
