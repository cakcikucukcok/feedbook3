  <title>Dangerous, Deceptive Webs - Steven W. Pollard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Sexually explicit and dangerously exciting, &lt;I&gt;Dangerous, Deceptive Webs&lt;/I&gt; explores the fine line of intimacy separating normal sex from abnormal sex. Three people find themselves ensnared in a love triangle of a different sort: victim, stalker, and rescuer, and each will be forced to re-examine his or her own definition of morality along the way. How far will each go in the pursuit of the fairy tale that is a happy endingand what does that even mean? Each will also be forced to confront his or her own past as it tortures their present and imperils their future. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Dr. Albertino has had two marriages ruined by sex and is determined to make his next relationship last, but will he be successful? His quest for the fairy tale is a tortured one, and his sessions with a beautiful therapist may hold more danger than safety for both. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The destructive powers of inappropriate sex, stalking, sex addiction, and incest seem to drive their lives. Can they learn how to escape the many traps in their paths? &lt;/P&gt;" />
