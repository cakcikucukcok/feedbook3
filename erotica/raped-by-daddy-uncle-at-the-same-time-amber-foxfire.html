  <title>Raped By Daddy &amp; Uncle - At The Same Time! - Amber FoxFire</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re a proper little whore. I wonder what your dad would think if he knew his good little Catholic girl was sucking off guys behind the liquor store.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Get out!&amp;rdquo; I snapped. Just as I went to rush past him to open the door and throw him out, he grabbed me by both arms and pushed me against the hallway wall. His grip was like iron, and his six-foot five frame made me feel like a dwarf by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Let me go,&amp;rdquo; I cried, twisting and wriggling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He bent down and started to lick my neck. He smelled of cheap booze and cigarettes. He was drunk.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I turned my head away from him as he tried to kiss my cherry-red lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Stop!&amp;rdquo; I shouted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just then, although secretly I wanted him to do the unthinkable, the front door opened.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Uncle John instantly let me go and straightened up. &amp;ldquo;Joe.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Dad!&amp;rdquo; I gasped, flinging myself into his arms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What the fuck&amp;rsquo;s going on here?&amp;rdquo; dad said, stroking my blonde hair as I clung to him like a small animal to a tree.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Just thought I&amp;rsquo;d start proceedings,&amp;rdquo; Uncle John said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I glanced at him over my shoulder and frowned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You were going to start without me?&amp;rdquo; dad replied." />
