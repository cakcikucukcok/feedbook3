  <title>Attempted Rapture: The Complete Series - Mitchell Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is the difference between &quot;following the heart&quot; and coercing an innocent person into a life of sin? In Bible-Belt culture, sexuality and sin are pushed so closely together that children grow up fearing sexual urges, seeing opportunity as devil-sent temptation and a teenage marriage as the only cure. But what happens when Christian youth revolts? They lunge into depravity, angry at God, disillusioned with life, and full of evil intentions. This tragic parody explores the issue as a modern-day Prodigal Son, Hal Persill, encounters incarnations of Proverbial &quot;Lady Wisdom&quot; and &quot;Madam Folly&quot; in two polar opposite sisters. Amara Stallart is a shining star of Christian loyalty who clings to her family ties. Anne McNamary is a self-professed heretic and harlot, shunned by the good old Radrick County community. This hard-edged Christian novel explores the cataclysm that results when faith interferes with human desire, and in some cases, the double lives that people live in order to reconcile their beliefs." />
