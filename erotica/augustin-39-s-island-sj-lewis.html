  <title>Augustin&#39;s Island - SJ Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jason Greer accepts an invitation from his wealthy friend Augustin to spend some time on his private island, he has no idea how much the visit will change his life. At his first island party, a stunning young woman, Alison, wearing an equally stunning dress, catches his eye, although she rebuffs him coldly. Later that evening, Augustin takes Jason to his stables - not where he houses his horses but to a smaller stable, where in a narrow stall, he&#39;s surprised to find the arrogant young woman from the party - now far more humbled than she was before. While Jason watches, Augustin casually strips her, binds her hands, and offers her to his guest for sex. Too stunned and intrigued to refuse, Jason stays the night, enjoying oral sex from the bound beauty as he becomes intoxicated by this lovely female. As his stay on the island continues, Jason acts out sexual fantasies with Alison that he&#39;s harbored for years. She&#39;s wonderfully submissive and ravenous in bed, and his desire for her grows stronger each day. He soon discovers that Augustin&#39;s Island has more secrets, and Augustin has many more women in his stables. New guests arrive for a yearly event where submissive women and dominant men revel freely in their secret fantasies. But even after viewing a kinky slave auction, Jason only has eyes for Alison. After a scene of rough sex and bondage on a remote part of the island, she offers herself exclusively to Jason during his stay, an offer he readily accepts. Leading her back to the estate bound at the end of a rope leash, he establishes his claim. While the torrid intensity of this budding relationship builds, the two realize that Jason&#39;s visit will end soon. He would like to take the young beauty home with him, but Alison has her reservations. She&#39;s returned to the island again and again because she can&#39;t find what she needs elsewhere. Can Jason be all the man she needs? Can she give up the life she know she needs? Or is Jason fated to return to the mainland alone?" />
