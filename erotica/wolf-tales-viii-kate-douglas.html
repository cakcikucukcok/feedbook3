  <title>Wolf Tales VIII - Kate Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Welcome To The Pack.  .  . &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the shadows they transform into beasts possessed of boundless sexual energy, with the strength and stamina to indulge every primal urge. Now, six new Chanku have appeared&amp;#8212;bold, brash, and very much in need of their elders&#39; wisdom. It is decided to split the young pack: three will travel to Montana to learn from Anton Cheval, and three to Colorado to be mentored by Ulrich Mason and his mate, Millie.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having weathered a series of vicious attacks, the Montana pack welcomes the distraction of breaking in the novices. But everything changes with the arrival of a mysterious stranger whose connection to Millie will bring the she-wolf, her partner, and their prot&amp;#233;g&amp;#233;s&amp;#8212;including Matt, the sensitive alpha Millie has brought to his sexual peak&amp;#8212;to Montana. The time has come for Millie to confront her past, even as the young Chanku prepare for a future of power, pride, and pure pleasure.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A searing erotic tale that will send your senses reeling.  .  .you don&#39;t want the story to end and can&#39;t wait for more.&quot; &amp;#8212;Cheyenne McCray" />
