  <title>The Elevation to Divinity - Goddess Ira, Osiris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New book explores BDSM relationship beyond the usual populist concepts of BDSM 
 The Elevation to Divinity  is a book which seeks to go beyond the usual populist concepts of BDSM
 The Elevation to Divinity is a book which seeks to go beyond the usual populist concepts of BDSM in order to explore the intense physical and physiological interactions which are created by the unquestioned submission of a slave to Goddess Ira. The relationship between Goddess Ira and Osiris describes much more than the interaction between a Top and a Bottom. It gives a unique overall insight in the customs and traditions of the BDSM community.  
The Elevation to Divinity is an adventurous and spiritual BDSM history at its best. It describes the gradual development of a BDSM relationship, the description of BDSM activities and sexual techniques. The background is historical and spiritual. The Elevation to Divinity is a BDSM-themed erotic novel infused with Egyptian mythology. 
During the quest of Goddess Ira, Osiris gives his ego to her. An ownership agreement of indefinite duration was concluded. There was no humiliation or task or punishment Osiris could not bear for her and no test went too far even if these BDSM test were extreme and bizarre." />
