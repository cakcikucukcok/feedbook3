  <title>Sweet Cinnamon and Honey - A. K. Fagan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a world where the governments have conspired to hide vampires&#39; existence from the public, it is impossible to protest oneself from the dangers of the night. Sophie Hart is no exception. When Mikhail, a powerful and dangerous vampire, takes an uncanny interest in her, Sophie is powerless to defend herself from his advances on her blood and body. Unable to retaliate or seek help, Sophie finds herself trapped in the grasp of a vampire who wants more from her than she is willing to give. Unfortunately, her trials with Mikhail have only just begun: she is his mate and tied to him for eternity. Mikhail is ruthless, cruel, and possessive, refusing to give her any freedom - not even to say goodbye to her friends. Sophie herself refuses to give in to his whims, but when she is overpowered and helpless, what can she really do? But she won&#39;t give up. So the only choice she has is to fight. And she&#39;ll fight until the bitter end." />
