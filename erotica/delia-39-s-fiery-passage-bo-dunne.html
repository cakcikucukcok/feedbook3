  <title>Delia&#39;s Fiery Passage - Bo Dunne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delia is a beautiful 19-year-old who fears she&amp;rsquo;s losing her loving, sexual relationship with her brother Greg, her hero. She lives for ways to ease Greg&amp;rsquo;s inner pain from his combat tour in Afghanistan, but he has a real girlfriend now and Delia&amp;rsquo;s afraid he doesn&amp;rsquo;t want her any more. When Greg has a flashback at work, only Delia can help&amp;mdash;while on her knees in front of him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Delia wanted to take care of Greg, yet she knew that she was just his baby sister. Kendra was a much better long-term possibility for him, if they didn&amp;rsquo;t care that Kendra had gone to college and had been an officer while he joined the Army right out of high school, had been a sergeant, and that she was four years older than Greg.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Delia was sure that Kendra would never concern herself with details of that kind. If Kendra truly loved Greg, she would never let anything like that stop her. It was one of many qualities of hers that Delia admired.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That lay in the future, though. Right now Delia just wanted to help Greg find time to adjust to being home again, even with his boring job at a carpet warehouse. Over time, she believed, a regular routine might help those horrible memories and nightmares fade a little.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once she heard Greg sleeping peacefully, she gently got out of bed. She took a quick shower and then, still nude, she padded out to the kitchen table. She sat on the seat of a cool chair and checked out her tablet. A friend named Connor had sent her email earlier that morning and she wanted to read it again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Delia and Connor had grown up together in the trailer park as well as attending the same schools. He had a full-ride scholarship to the University of Florida over in Gainesville, and Delia knew he was one of the sharpest people she knew.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They were closer than just friends. His mom, Mattie, was one of her mom&amp;rsquo;s longtime co-workers at the Grillin&amp;rsquo; Gator Bar. The two moms had often traded babysitting chores for each other, and Delia had spent many childhood hours playing with Connor. Recently, she had made a deal with him in the hope that he would be more assertive and ask out more girls when he was away at college. He was a tall, nerdy guy who needed encouragement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After all, she and Greg had an open relationship based on love, not rules. They were both free to play the field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today&amp;rsquo;s email told her that he was back at his mom&amp;rsquo;s trailer just for a weekend visit. Also, he asked if she could come over for a visit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Delia, sitting nude at the kitchen table, laughed to herself as she read between the lines. The deal she had made was that if he would ask more girls out, and record his voice and theirs on his phone to prove it, Delia would reward him with mercy sex just for trying&amp;mdash;unless, of course, the miracle day finally came when he got a regular girl of his own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No way that&amp;rsquo;s happened so soon,&amp;rdquo; Delia said aloud to herself, feeling bad for him. She figured Connor was inviting her over to hear or see the evidence proving that he had asked out a girl or two, so Delia would keep her promise. Curious to see what would happen, she sent him a text, saying she would be over as soon as she showered and dressed." />
