  <title>The Complete Humiliation Training 6-Book Bundle/Anthology - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sometimes, you have to be subdued in order to submit. The submissives in these complete short stories let go of their inhibitions and surrender everything to complete strangers in broad daylight.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The Humiliation Training of S starts with an innocent young woman who falls into the clutches of dominating alpha males who don&amp;#39;t hesitate in making her submit, no matter the circumstances. She is filled in an airplane, an office, a bar, an elevator, and many other all-too-public places.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She is blindfolded, tied up, humiliated, and dominated, her life turned upside down as she is filled with unadulterated pleasures... and pain.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
Humiliation Training begins with Nicky, whose troubles begin when she goes to a doctor for her creaming problems. Her sexy doctor no qualms helping her with his bare hands - and lips - or bringing friends in to witness her shameful problem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her new job as a personal maid is turning out to be a lot dirtier than she anticipated. Not only is she expected to wear skimpy uniforms during work hours, she has to surrender to everyone in the office. And falling in love with her boss isn&amp;#39;t helping.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This complete trilogy brings you on Nicky&amp;#39;s journey from an innocent, naive young woman to a humiliated, submissive exhibitionist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t move unless I tell you to,&amp;quot; he said simply as he grasped the thick ropes in his hand. I couldn&amp;#39;t help but wonder how he was going to tie me up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Unquestioningly, I stood still as each piece of rope was bound across me. At first, I stared at him and watched how he expertly tied the knots around my body, but my focus is soon diverted to the way the ropes felt as they were wrapped around me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could feel each fiber of the rope against my skin, every intake of breath making the rope dig in just a little deeper, then loosen as I exhaled. Instead of feeling panicked, I got calmer and breathed deeper as he wound the rope over my wrists and ankles, keeping it tightly around my body, but with loose bits that hung from it. I knew he wanted to tie me to something but didn&amp;#39;t know what exactly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He took more and more control of my body with each layer that he added, and my flesh belonged to him. It was no longer about what I was ready to give, but how much. He pushed me forward until I was leaning against something soft, my stomach pressing against the cushion. I looked down and saw a flat, thin surface in front of me, only about a palm&amp;#39;s width wide.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He tugged the rope on my left ankle to indicate I should move it. I hesitated for a second, and then complied.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Without saying a word, he bound my hands with ropes to the bars on the mechanism he had placed me onto. He bent me over and tied me legs spread apart, with a good four feet between them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The silence rang in my ears and I knew I should feel uncomfortable, but I was oddly calmed by the ropes bound around me. The lack of choice made me free unencumbered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was leaning against a long cylindrical cushion with four legs, each holding one of my limbs, trapping me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My wrists and ankles were tied firmly to the legs of the odd furniture, making me look as if I was offering myself to whomever decided to come into the room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was nothing graceful about my position, but that didn&amp;#39;t matter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The inability to move my hands and legs trapped me in the position. I was afraid that if I struggled, I would fall off the contraption completely. I couldn&amp;#39;t see him as he stepped behind me, but I could feel his warm breath against my skin." />
