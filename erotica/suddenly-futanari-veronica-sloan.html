  <title>Suddenly Futanari - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Cassie&amp;#39;s in love with her straight roommate Rebecca, but she&amp;#39;s afraid to confess her feelings. She used to hate the little ditz, but over the years their friendship has become the one constant in her busy life. Unfortunately, Becca is boy crazy, which makes a relationship impossible. Or does it? After a visit to a fortune teller, Cass discovers she now possesses Rebecca&amp;#39;s favorite male body part!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
Reluctantly, I met her amber eyes. &amp;quot;Tell me this is a nightmare,&amp;quot; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;quot; she replied. &amp;quot;It could be worse.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How?&amp;quot; I moaned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She fought hard to suppress her grin. &amp;quot;Well, I mean, it&amp;#39;s...it&amp;#39;s a really pretty penis.&amp;quot; I fought even harder to pull my fingers from her grip. She held fast, though. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry!&amp;quot; she cried. &amp;quot;Honey, I&amp;#39;m sorry. I&amp;#39;m so sorry.&amp;quot; She took my cheek in her palm and kissed my wet lips. Tears and sweat had stained them and dripped down to my chin. She kissed me again, harder, and rubbed her nose into mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know how it happened,&amp;quot; I whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve never seen it before?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Have you?&amp;quot; I intoned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; she said quickly. &amp;quot;And I&amp;#39;ve checked you out a few times.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Please be serious,&amp;quot; I sobbed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I am!&amp;quot; she shot back. &amp;quot;You have beautiful hips, and my ass will never look like that. But, uh, how do you just grow a penis overnight? Are you on steroids or something?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No!&amp;quot; I growled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rebecca bit her lip. She tried not to look at it again, but her eyes kept flitting from my teary face to my lap. &amp;quot;Does...does it hurt?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I huffed, and crossed my arms over my breasts. The shock of adrenaline was wearing off and I could finally feel how cold it was in the apartment. &amp;quot;Well, no, I guess...&amp;quot; My new appendage poked up at Rebecca like it had a question. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s hard, and uncomfortable!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She studied it with amusement. &amp;quot;Are you turned on?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I glared at her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She softly caressed my thigh and examined it more closely. It seemed that we were now in her realm of expertise. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve heard of guys getting stress boners, but... When did you first notice you had a dick?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;When I screamed.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; she said. She fit her elbow into her palm and poked her lip, in thought. &amp;quot;So it&amp;#39;s morning wood, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Please don&amp;#39;t make fun.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her doe eyes turned up to me, all innocence. &amp;quot;Cassie...I&amp;#39;m not. I want to help.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t,&amp;quot; I whispered. And as I tried to speak again, my voice broke. I couldn&amp;#39;t bear the weight of this embarrassment. I was confused, and scared, and Rebecca wouldn&amp;#39;t leave. She wouldn&amp;#39;t leave, and neither would she be deterred. She took my fingers again, and squeezed fiercely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes I can,&amp;quot; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was bewildered. &amp;quot;How?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She reached for it, and I jerked away. &amp;quot;No!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Let me,&amp;quot; she said softly. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know what the hell is going on, and you know I&amp;#39;m not a genius, but I know how to get rid of a boner. Do you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It...&amp;quot; My heart was already thumping like a broken boombox. I swallowed, and swallowed again, but I just couldn&amp;#39;t get enough air into my lungs. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;ll go down by itself,&amp;quot; I insisted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rebecca eyed my penis. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know. You&amp;#39;re...really hard.&amp;quot;" />
