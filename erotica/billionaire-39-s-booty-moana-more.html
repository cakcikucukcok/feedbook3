~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~
It’s been almost two months since I saw him. But in my mind it’s as clear as day. That last night, in his room, his bed. His strong hands taking my body for the first time. I could still even imagine his manly scent as if it had never left me.
Now, it is just me alone here at college.
All I could think about was Richard. His scent, his breath and the unforgettable way he touched me…
I couldn&#39;t handle it anymore. I needed the real thing, even if that real thing was just some boy I could use long enough to stop thinking of Richard. To stop thinking of Richard’s hands touching me, his body, his....
In that moment of frustration I thought, “It’s Friday night and the rowdiest frat was having one of its biggest parties of the season. Girls were always welcome, so, what the hell! I was too young not to have fun.”
I wasn&#39;t quite sure who he was. I had never seen him before on campus. But there was something about him, his eyes perhaps. He was quite handsome for a college boy. He had blonde hair and a clear complexion. Mmmm, I thought, he’d do. In fact, it was the first time I seemed to be attracted to someone close to my age. I wasn&#39;t sure if it was his crystal blue eyes or his build. He must have been well over 6 feet tall, and he looked like a swimmer since he had that beautiful swimmer’s physique. I found out later from one of the girls who was gawking at him that he was a senior, just 3 years older than me.
He must have noticed me glancing over at him because before I knew it he came over and started a little small talk. “Hop in, I’ll take you someplace a little more quiet and much more enticing.”
“Come on, I’ll take you for a tour,” I said.
We walked up the stairs and it was the shortest tour in the history of house tours as I led him right to my bedroom.
Then we started going at it, hot and passionate. I pulled him down to the bed and he was all over me, just what I needed, when…
“What the hell’s going on here!” I heard in a deep commanding voice.
I leapt up and pushed him off of me. Topless, I sat up and turned my head sharply towards the doorway.
“Richard! What the hell…are…you…” I startled.
