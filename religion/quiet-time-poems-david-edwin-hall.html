  <title>Quiet Time Poems - David Edwin Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every day, there are treasures to be discovered by anyone who will honestly come to hear the voice of the Savior in his Word. The Lord Jesus indicates that there is an added blessing for those who will write down the insights he gives by his instruction: Every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and old (Matthew 13:52). 
The poems in this book are the result of going to the Bible each day with an expectation that God has something very valuable to say. That expectation has NEVER been disappointed. Our risen Lord said, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hears My voice and opens the door, I will come into him and will sup with him, and he with Me (Revelation 3:20). This intimate, two-way communion with God is offered to all those who have received the Lord Jesus Christ (John 1:12) and thereby have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us by God (1 Corinthians 2:12). My prayer is that God may use this book for his glory, for the encouragement of his own children, and for the persuasion of those who may yet be awakened to their need of our Savior. Blessed is the man that heareth Me, watching daily at My gates, waiting at the post of My doors (Proverbs 8:34). Heaven is waiting. Dont miss it for the world." />
