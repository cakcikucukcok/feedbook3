  <title>A User-Friendly Universe? - Clifford Chalmers Cain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written for Christian laypersons who want to think about their faith and be given creative and relevant suggestions about what it means to attempt authentic Christian living in todays world, and for religious professionals who want or need to reflect on various topics and issues of the Christian faith journey and desire mental stimulation and spiritual inspiration regarding them. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Rev. Dr. Cliff Cain, Harrod-C.S. Lewis Professor of Religious Studies at Westminster College, provides a compelling response to the question Can God be an effective and reliant participant in a user-friendly 21st century universe?  This book is current, intellectually stimulating, and offers a multigenerational perspective to age-old questions that demand answers that enable deeper understanding.  Set aside the time to read this marvelous book! &lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Benjamin Ola. Akande, Ph.D. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President, Westminster College&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book should be required reading for any college course seeking to orient students to the issues that address meaning in their lives.  It should also be used as a valuable resource for local church adult education courses.  I know Cliff Cain to be a rare combination of scholar and pastor, and this blending allows the reader to catch his enthusiasm and passion for the Christian life.  The reader will be drawn-in to an in-depth dialogue about the Christian journey and current Christian issues.  I recommend it highly. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Reverend Erwin R. Bode, B.A., M.Div., S.T.M., D.D. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leader in Progressive Ecumenical Higher Education &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ministries for 20 years&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a fresh and engaging style, Professor Cain applies biblical values and stories in short reflections that give the reader a way to escape the daily rush and settle into the quiet of mindful reflection.  Like Jesus own story-telling style, Cain takes language and images familiar to his audience, but turns them on their heads, reinterpreting them with Gospel values, and even connections to other faiths.  A User-friendly Universe? is an enriching read for anyone connected to college as a place which celebrates the life of the mind and the cultivation of the spirit. &lt;p&gt;
