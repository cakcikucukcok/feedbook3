The study is scripture only.  Leaving the meditation you make through out to be the revelation between you, the reader and the Spirit inspired word of God.
Take time to meditate.  Review whole passages that each scripture was pulled from as the Holy Spirit leads you to do so.
The space to the right of each passage of scripture was provided for notes as the scripture speaks new revelation to your spirit.
Read slowly do not rush through the study.  We believe you will never be the same as the new revelations change you from inside out." />
