  <title>“Angel-Vision Vs Television” - Benjamin Lee Vince</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the first book in my new Goliath Awaits Series. Angel-Vision VS Television is a psychoanalysis study of neurosis relating to the progressive change in the thought pattern as well as the nature of man based upon the theory of Psychosis, a mental disorder marked by the loss of contact with reality. Neurosis is defined as impulsive mental disorders. This author will challenge these supportive titles to prove the world is suffering from this disease in one form or another, caused by the continual consumption of negative, immoral, and meaningless performances, creating compulsive changes within the heart, which has removed man from the world of reality and placed him into a would of fantasies. &lt;br&gt;
David and Goliath offer a great cast of character shadows and symbolic impersonations relating to each of our lives today. My credentials: fifty years of apostolic studies. I feel privileged to pen these intellectual objectives, transforming their shadows into reality for the era of today. Come with me now as we read aboutThe Weapon of Mass-Distraction.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
     Born in western Kentucky, Benjamin Lee Vince, not knowing it was the move of God, relocated to Pontiac, Michigan in 1952 where he began a career in 1962 in the ministry under the personal teaching ministry of the late Bishop L.A. Parent, and after acquiring a journeyman status in the tooling industry, and because of a sagging economy, in 1971 he returned to his home State. Later in life, to fulfill his calling, he created The Goliath Awaits book series of which three are now in print. This is book One. Revised &amp; edited.
