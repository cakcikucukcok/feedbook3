  <title>Miracles in Red - Cathy Hopper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Miracles in Red is our testimony of the Miracles in Red that happen in our lives, and we believe are still happening everyday!
Walter, and we will never forget the day the doctor came in my hospital room, and told us there was nothing else he could do for me except send me home, the doctor told us he was a praying man, and he would pray for me, he said my arteries were all blocked, and they couldn&#39;t do bypass surgery again. We just didn&#39;t understand why they couldn&#39;t do something else! But then we took our minds off ourselves, and began to put our eyes back on Jesus, we reminisced about years ago when the bills were due, and we didn&#39;t have the money to pay them, we would say a prayer, and write the check by faith, and it would be there just in time, and when the kids were sick, and the medicine was way too expensive, but we decided to trust in God, and He made a way. Sure there were times of many trials, and we wondered if the answer would ever come, but we stood on the word of God. We waited on the Lord know this because we have faith in God, and in the power of prayer. Romans 3-23 reads; All have sinned, and fallen short of the glory of God. and are justified by His grace, as a gift though Salvation that is in Christ Jesus received by faith. Jesus Christ the name above all names is still just as powerful as it ever was, and His grace is sufficient for us all. For everyone who have read Miracles in Red, and want to know about the birds, God is still sending the beautiful red cardinal birds everyday. We believe in miracles! We hope that our book, Miracles in Red, will really bless you, increase your faith, and that you will know just how much God really does loves you! Miracles in Red is available at Christian World in Blytheville, That Bookstore in Blytheville, at Barnes and Noble.com, Amazon.com, and many online bookstores online.

Merry Christmas everyone!
