  <title>Finding Freedom - Donna J. Stundahl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel like youre wandering in a wilderness alone? Are you searching for the same freedom the children of Israel sought, only to find oppression at every turn? Are you looking for a life filled with promise, only to be repeatedly disappointed? You are not alone. We are all on a journey, from slavery to sin to the ultimate Promised Land in Heaven, where we will be free. Everything in between is a wilderness experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moses expounded on freedom in the wilderness. He explained exactly where to find it and how to get there. He clearly spoke to the Jew and the foreigner. The question is: Does He speak to the Christian as well? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her book Finding Freedom, Dr. Stundahl will wander through the wilderness of Deuteronomy and explore the Hebraic roots of Christianity. Finding Freedom reveals the concepts of the Torah, assembled in the same format in which they were studied by the Jewish communities since the Babylonian exile. These concepts include humility, idolatry, evil speech, teaching, learning, remembering and listening. The analysis of each portion of the Torah considers its applicability to the life of a Christian. As the history of Christianity and the Jewish elements of the Gospel are discovered, the shadows of Jesus Christ are revealed.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Wherever you are in the wilderness of your life, you too can find the freedom intended just for you! Experience the reading, the writing, and the dance of the Torah.&lt;/p&gt;" />
