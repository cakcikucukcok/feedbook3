  <title>Menace Eastern-Light, the Man in the Grey Suit - Johann Heinrich Jung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Jung-Stilling was a mystic and Christian visionary, and member of the German Pietist Brethren. He personally experienced the terrors and tragedies of war after the invasion of Germany by France in 1792, and the effects of the Enlightenment and the French Revolution on religion, morality and life in his homeland. Jung believed that Jesus Christ would come in the year 1836, convinced that the events of Europe during this era were the signs of the end of the age. Jung developed a plan to evangelize and prepare Germany for the return of Jesus Christ, which he expounds in this book. Menace Eastern-Light, the Man in the Grey Suit, written 1795-1800, is a compilation of the mystical and evangelical concepts of Jung. This translation makes available to the English-reading public the valuable ideas and concepts of this unique and famous German mystic and Christian visionary.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The person of Menace Eastern-Light is the alter-ego of Jung. Menace was originally the main character in Jungs book Homesickness, and who always wore grey clothing. Even though Jung is a character in his own book, his is distinct from Menace, and Jung becomes the recorder of the thoughts and opinions of Menace. As alter-ego of Jung, Menace considers himself a demi-god, an angelic entity who descended from heaven and became incarnated; he is commissioned to rectify the corruption of the Christian religion in Germany and to prepare the people for the arrival of Christ in 1836.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The translator is Daniel H. Shubin, who has previously translated 5 books into English dealing with Christianity in Russian and Europe; and is the author of 2 books on the Bible and one on Christian pacifism.&lt;/P&gt;" />
