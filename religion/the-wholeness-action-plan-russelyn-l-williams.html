  <title>The Wholeness Action Plan - Russelyn L Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you become broken due to a situation that came into your life out of the blue that flipped your world upside down? Do you find yourself going through one trial and test after the other despite your commitment to do things the right way? Have you become confused or angry with God due to the pain of life circumstance? You are not alone.&lt;br /&gt;
Every genuine believer goes through similar places of confusion and brokenness. Sometimes the brokenness is due to our own doings, and other times, it is because God has us in process because he is promoting us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good thing is God does not abandon us to a life of brokenness. Instead, he posts himself up to us even closer to get to us the right perspectives of his heart and mind toward us that makes us whole. There is something so precious about a father who looks out for his children. This is what God has done in Russelyn&amp;#39;s life when she questioned God and was tempted to give in to settling into a life of brokenness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russelyn Williams discusses in &amp;quot;The Wholeness Action Plan&amp;quot; Biblical truths that will shift a broken person&amp;#39;s perspective into one of wholeness. This wholeness will come from the consistent reminders of who we are in Christ and God&amp;#39;s good plans for us. Many times, where and how we see ourselves in life have to do with our mindsets. If we can become whole in our thinking, we can become whole in every area of lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God is so great that he takes the hardest things of life and turns it into something for our good. There can be benefits in a broken life that is submitted to Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
