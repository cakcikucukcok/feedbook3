  <title>God&#39;s Divorce - Colin Hamer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this simple yet profound study, Colin Hamer shows the reader that the Bible is the dramatic story of two marriages and two divorces. God&amp;#39;s relationship with humanity from the Garden of Eden to the end of time mirrors a marriage relationship, and the gospel is an offer by the Bridegroom Messiah of a final reconciliation and a new marriage for all those who come to the marriage supper of the Lamb. Only once we understand these biblical references to God&amp;#39;s own marriage to his people can we understand New Testament teaching about human marriage, divorce, and remarriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;God&amp;#39;s Divorce unpacks, in easy to follow terms, the findings of Colin Hamer&amp;#39;s widely acclaimed and ground-breaking PhD, Marital Imagery in the Bible (Apostolos, 2015), which re-examined the New Testament&amp;#39;s teaching on divorce and remarriage in light of recently discovered documents from New Testament times. The result is an understanding that has eluded the church since early post-apostolic times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Commendations of Hamer&amp;#39;s work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Hamer&amp;#39;s appeal to marital imagery throughout Scripture and how it informs our understanding of the New Testament&amp;#39;s teaching on divorce and remarriage is brilliant.&amp;#39; -&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;William A.
