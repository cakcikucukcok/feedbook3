  <title>Treasure in Earthen Vessels - Evangelist Francis Boafo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you are born-again and filled with the Holy Spirit, the most important knowledge you need to have is the knowledge of your new identity in Christ. You have a spiritual relationship with God, and you are a part of the new order that Jesus has established in the worship and service to God. You are an earthen vessel filled with the power of heaven to function as an ambassador for Christ, a coworker with God to people in this world. Therefore, it is important to discover by illumination your divine status in Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You must also discover the demand your new identity places on you so you will pursue a purposeful, spirit-filled life in this world, which is becoming chaotic by evil deeds. Seek grace to orient your belief system so you will take Jesus at His Word and embrace what heaven is saying about you! God has provided all you need to help you triumph in this world and to function in the supernatural as a conqueror. The choice is yours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book clearly teaches that acknowledgment of our identity in Christ Jesus is a powerful precursor to entertaining His presence. It defines our new self, which reflects His presence daily. Each scriptural-based lesson presented is complemented with inspired yet practical elaboration. Enjoy this dynamic read.&lt;br /&gt;
