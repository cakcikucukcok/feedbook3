  <title>Especially for You - Dolly J. Rodríguez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is no coincidence that you have this book in your hands today. The Lord had it prepared especially for you, for your needs, for you to win your daily battles, and for you to take the power and authority He has given those who believe and trust in Him. It is the moment to behold the fulfillment of the promises that the Lord has for your life and to take the blessings for you and your family. Be born again, believe the Lord and confess His word and you will see great wonders which you have never imagined. After reading even the first page, your life will never be the same again. The Spirit of the Lord, especially for you, will fill you with His love, faithfulness and grace, just because He loves you and knows you.
Live this unique and personal relationship that only the Lord can give you. As He did with me, so can He do it with you. Let yourself be an instrument of the Lord. Remember that it is &quot;Especially For You.&quot; Live it and take it in your life in the name of Jesus." />
