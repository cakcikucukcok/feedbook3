  <title>Generation One - Adam Parrish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If you hang around any given church in America long enough, you will eventually hear someone say, God only calls us to be faithful! It is a quaint little saying that sounds good as it rolls off the lips. But there is a serious problem with it: it just isnt true. God calls us to be more than faithful. He calls us to be fruitful. John the Baptist put it simply, Produce fruit in keeping with repentance (Matthew 3:8), and Jesus Himself said, This is to my Fathers glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples (John 15:8). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too many have settled merely for a faithful life. They faithfully attend church, faithfully give of their finances, and faithfully try to be nice to people. Thats commendable, but do you long for something more than that? Does your heart cry out for a life that transcends faithful duty and actually bears fruitfruit that will last for eternity? Then this book was written with you in mind. Using humor, inspiration, and everyday illustrations, pastor and author Adam Parrish looks to the first generation of the Church for instruction and inspiration to help us fulfill Gods call to be fruitful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
