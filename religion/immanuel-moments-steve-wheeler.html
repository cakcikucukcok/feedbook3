  <title>Immanuel Moments - Steve Wheeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are living in dark and discouraging times. This darkness has a way of draining us of any hope that we might have for better days. When we do get a glimpse of hope, there seems to an unbeatable giant to face or a raging river to cross. Any hope we have is quickly cast down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is in those moments that God wants to show Himself mighty on our behalf. He wants to rout our enemies and put them to flight. He wants to strengthen us so we stand up and defeat the giants that seem unbeatable. He wants to part the waters so we can cross over into His land of promised blessing and prosperity. He wants to be ImmanuelGod with us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endorsements:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Immanuel Moments&lt;/i&gt; is one mans testimony of how God is with us even in our darkest hour. It reminds us that, truly, all things work together for the good of those who love the Lord and are called according to His purpose. It reminds us that we cannot escape the love of our Father even though we wonder far from home. &lt;/br&gt;
Steve Leach&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awesome book full of moments when God stepped into Steves life to send a message of encouragement, love, hope, and strength to him. This book will inspire you to seek the plans and purpose you were created for and challenge you to remember and share the Immanuel Moments in your own life. &lt;/br&gt;
