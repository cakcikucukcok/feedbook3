  <title>Peace, Be Still - Rev. Gregory L. Johnson, Rev. Marion A. Gambardella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are those to whom we naturally turn for prayer, and Greg Johnson is such a one. Called into ministry with those who carry heavy burden he never fails to find the grace that lives even within the hardest of times. Though this is a gift from God, the ability to receive it is hard-won. No human challenge goes unacknowledged, and no human person unloved, in these prayers and meditations. &lt;br /&gt;
The Rev. Dr. Barbara C. Crafton &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How can you carry on when supporting your loved one seems to demand more than you can give at times? Marion Gambardella and Gregory Johnson are two people who know the answer to that question. They have walked the path! Marion Gambardella has blessed me and my family with her love and rich spiritual insights. This book offers us the nourishment that can give us the strength to meet the caregivers demands. &lt;br /&gt;
Rev. Phillip Pierson, former co-host &lt;br /&gt;
of the The Best is Yet to Be television program &lt;br /&gt;
and vice president of Unity School of Christianity &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Peace, Be Still is a deeply religious book - in the best sense of the word. In their intensely compassionate way, Reverends Johnson and Gambardella have provided encouragement and a Divine shoulder on which to lean for those who give so much of themselves to care for loved ones. Even for those who are non-believers, this volumes meditations can focus the mind and provide inspiration for the noble task of caring for a fellow human being. The book ranges from the poetic to the practical by including an essential guide to resources for family caregiving. &lt;br /&gt;
