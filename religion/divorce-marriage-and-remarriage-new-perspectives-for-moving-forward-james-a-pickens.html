  <title>Divorce, Marriage, and Remarriage: New Perspectives for Moving Forward - James A. Pickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At last, Christians and non-Christians alike are offered fresh discoveries relating to this very controversial topic. Christ saves us for service, and only through serving Him can the believer find fulfillment in this life. While many would restrain or limit opportunities to serve in a specific position in Christs church because of divorce and/or remarriage, I discover just the opposite is true. The ability to overcome the disappointments and failures every believer experiences can be used to encourage and guide others who face similar trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many have tried to reconcile the various passages dealing with marriage, divorce, and remarriage. To my thinking, they provide unsatisfying results. It seems two very basic and pivotal questions are overlooked and have yet to be answered. At what point in time does God recognize a man and a woman have moved from courtship or engagement to marriage? And when exactly, in Gods view, is a marriage put asunder or nullified? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without becoming bogged down in a ton of technicalities and arguments, the reader is presented clear and fresh insights providing understanding and direction to boldly move ahead in service and devotion for the ultimate glory of the King of kings.&lt;/p&gt;" />
