  <title>Being Jesus in Nashville - Jim Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author and former pastor Jim Palmer should be dead. Over the course of a year that included two near-death experiences, as Palmer set out to disentangle Jesus from the religious machinery of Christianity, he discovered a profound and unexpected answer to the question on his mind: What would Jesus do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploring what it really means to be Jesus in his hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, Palmer learns that Jesus was special not because he was more divine than the rest of us, but because he was courageously more human than most. Unfortunately, this realization crystallized for him while he was hanging upside down in his overturned car, expecting to die. When Palmer was miraculously pulled from the wreckage alive, he emerged with a new courage to embrace his life as never before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Being Jesus in Nashville&lt;/i&gt;, Palmer shares his personal stories, ideas, concepts, and an innovative approach to humanity as he learns that being Jesus means&lt;/p&gt;
	seeing people as they truly are;
letting it happen, not making it happen;
	being at peace, whatever happens;
	putting no limitations on God;
	living without separation from God;
following your own path;
	living as everyones neighbor.
&lt;p&gt;With spiritual insight and refreshing theological glimpses, Palmer shares how he traded in his Christianity for Jesus and how this brought him closer to God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
