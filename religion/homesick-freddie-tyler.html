  <title>HOMESICK - Freddie Tyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homesick&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the story of the journeys these two men and two women take into the afterlife, into eternity. Donovan and Wade travel together as do Carol and Bianca. What they encounter in those journeys I hope will make you think about the journey you will one day take. At some time in your life you have probably missed home, wherever that may have been. You went overnight to a friend&amp;lsquo;s house, or to camp for a week, or maybe when you entered the military, or went off to college. It is quite possible you never had a physical place to call home to miss, and yet you still experienced&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;HOMESICK homesickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You missed not having a home and wondered what that would be like. This might be the worst homesickness of all. The thought of dying is not something people regularly think about. You may think about death when a member of your family or a friend dies. We will push the thought of it out of our minds as quickly as possible when we have been confronted by the deaths of people in a terrorist attack or a catastrophic natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth of life is that it ends in death. While not everyone has a building to call home, every man and woman have a home here on Earth called a body. This is where YOU reside. This home is also temporary. In spite of efforts to ?repair or ?remodel, this home of ours will one day die. The good news is that when death comes, every man and woman have the opportunity to ?move into? the most wonderful home imaginable when their earthly home is gone. What will your home look like? Donovan, Wade, Carol, and Bianca will give you a glimpse of what it could look like. It is my hope and prayer that everyone who reads this story will be homesick, homesick for Heaven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our body is like a house we live in here on earth. When it is destroyed, we know that God has another body for us in heaven. The new one will not be made by human hands as a house is made. This body will last forever. Right now, we cry inside ourselves because we wish we could have our new body which we will have in heaven. We will not be without a body. We will live in a new body. While we are in this body, we cry inside ourselves because things are hard for us. It is not that we want to die. Instead, we want to live in our new bodies. We want this dying body to be changed into a living body that lasts forever. It is God Who has made us ready for this change. He has given us His Spirit to show us what He has for us (2 Corinthians 5: 1-5).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EPIGRAPH ?&amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;You must think of yourself &amp;ndash; for God sent His Son into the world to save you! ?Here I insist that you must have some faith about yourself and I am almost afraid to say it because someone will send me a critical, nagging letter. ?I am not asking you to have faith in yourself &amp;ndash; I am only insisting that it is right for you to show faith about yourself, faith in Christ and in what He has promised you as an individual person. ?That is, you must believe that you are the one He meant when He said, ?Come home.&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Jesus: The Life and Ministry of God the Son&lt;br /&gt;
