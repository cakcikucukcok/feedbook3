  <title>One Foot in Heaven - Janice Reck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One Foot In Heaven is a testament to the power of prayer and how all prayers are heard and often answered. In 2009 Janice was faith-healed by Jesus Christ of diseases that were killing her and she had subsequent visions of meeting the Archangels, her relatives, Jesus, and God the Father in Heaven. It would take years for some of these memories to emerge in the form of visions. She was told she was being healed by Jesus because of her mother&#39;s prayers and her best friend Regina&#39;s prayers. She had previously been somewhat skeptical of faith-healing because of how it was projected by the media; that is until she was faith-healed herself. Jesus told Janice that her mother had been praying for her to meet someone as well. Janice&#39;s dreams and visions would include a brown haired man with blue eyes. As she got to know her husband Tom, he would validate some of the things from her dreams, and future events would also confirm that he was the one she had dreamt about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janice takes you on a journey through her life and writes about the different moments when God has saved her life, kept her safe, or altered her path, like He did prior to 9/11. She talks about how God has even answered the smallest of prayers at times.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Janice feels that this day in age, more than ever before, people need to hear and know that miracles still happen and that God is ever-present. Janice hopes this book will inspire people to pray for others, to seek God&#39;s guidance in their everyday lives, and to carry them through the difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
