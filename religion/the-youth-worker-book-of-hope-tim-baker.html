  <title>The Youth Worker Book of Hope - Tim Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You know, we&amp;rsquo;re an interesting breed. We pour our whole life into ministry&amp;mdash;giving physically, emotionally, spiritually, relationally, even financially. And, we do all of this to encourage students to live like Christ beyond youth group. Even when we struggle, fail, or find ourselves at the end of a long month feeling drained and discouraged we&amp;rsquo;re still called to show our students the love of Jesus. The Youth Worker Book of Hope offers you encouragement and hope in those moments of darkness by using experiences and advice from people who have been through the valley and learned from it. Youth workers from around the country have contributed personal stories of their own desire to quit, confrontations with parents, struggles with running the ministry, getting fired, and many more. You&amp;rsquo;ll read about how other youth workers messed up and how they found hope at the end of a seemingly hopeless road. In tough times it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost. The Youth Worker Book of Hope meets you while you&amp;rsquo;re still struggling and draws you in to the hope of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
