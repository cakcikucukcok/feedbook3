  <title>Love’S Lure: God’S Project People - John Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We were created, designed, in Gods image, but God will always be a mystery to our minds, bound as they are by time and space. By attempting to achieve atonement with God, a state of harmony and oneness, we can realize our true purposesharing in the boundless love with which God has bequeathed us and with which he provided the spark for our evolution to begin. Our evolution continues as we move into the future, and we can no longer afford to let our faith and our thinking be influenced by ancient beliefs. 
In &lt;i&gt;Loves Lure: Gods Project People: A Third Millennium Vision,&lt;/i&gt; author John Ford seeks to bridge the gap between theology and science by examining how Gods Word speaks to us in the present and transforms our modern understanding of truth, spirit, and love. With his intimate knowledge of Scripture, Ford helps us explore the nature of Godhead and Jesuss life and teachings as they contribute to the redefinition of faithtruth lies in what God says to us now, and in following his loving example. 
Every disaster and mishap should be regarded as an opportunity for the outpouring of love and represents a chance to work tirelessly for positive change. We are all engaged in Gods ongoing venture to create beings in harmony with him, but how we let his work touch our hearts is always up to us." />
