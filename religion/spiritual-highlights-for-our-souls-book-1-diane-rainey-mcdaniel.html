  <title>Spiritual Highlights for Our Souls Book 1 - Diane-Rainey McDaniel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are there some things that you wished others would discuss?
      Many times I have gone into the bookstore and have hoped that I would find a book that dealt with some of the tough things in life. I would find a few topics in a book, but many topics were not being discussed.
     One day while I was at work one of my co-workers told me that she was writing a book about poems. I got so excited for her, but at the same time God began to stir up some things within me. He reminded me about the Spiritual Highlights that He had given me. The next time I saw my co-worker I told her about the Highlights and she encouraged me to get them published.
     Spiritual Highlights for Our Souls is a book written for the unsaved and saved. It is a book that does not make you feel that you are unworthy of Gods love, but it makes you feel that His love is unconditional for you.
     The Highlights covers many topics that most people think about, but chooses not to discuss. Some of the Highlights will make you cry, some will make you laugh and all of them will inspire you to tell Satan enough is enough." />
