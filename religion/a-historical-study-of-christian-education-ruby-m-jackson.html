  <title>A Historical Study of Christian Education - Ruby M. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christian education recognizes the value of family throughout Scripture; it re-affirms the centrality of biblical revelation in the teaching process. It examines Jesus as teacher, mentor, and leader. It recognizes the role of the Holy Spirit and responds to the Great Commission in ministry and refocuses on education for spiritual growth.
In this book, I have provided biblically supportive documented views of those persons who influenced or those who were influenced by Christian educational concepts in the process of teaching and learning. The historians referenced in this book do not claim to be theologians or philosophers, but educators with expertise in the area of Christian education.
The Old and New Testaments will be used as biblical references, along with other supporting documents throughout this book to illustrate Gods Word and its implication in the teaching and learning of His people. Finally, you will have a better understanding of the true meaning of Christian education in the following areas:
	purpose 
	a historical perspective 
	instructional process 
	targeted population
	leadership
