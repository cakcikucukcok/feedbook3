  <title>Day-To-Day Writings from Jesus of Nazareth Through James Coyle Morgan - James Coyle Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My mother and stepfather, Jim, were co-ministering at the Unity Church in Fresno, California, in 1970. Jim went into his study for a while and then called to my mother, Audre, and she went in to find he was writing. He handed her a page that she started reading; it said, I am Jesus of Nazareth. I want you, Jim, to write the true facts of my life. So, he went on to write the book Jesus and Mastership. While doing so, they asked Jesus if they could ask him questions, and that is how they came up with the Day-to-Day Writing from Jesus of Nazareth manuscript, which I am now making into a book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is made up of words of wisdom, comments, and answers to questions asked by Audre and Jim. If you read the book, you will learn about praise and giving thanks; love, faith, and prayer; and spiritual strength. You will learn that love is prayer. You will find answers to questions such as: Can God speak to us? Did the incident of David and Goliath actually take place?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many more questions and comments in the book. That is what the book is aboutall the words of wisdom from Jesus. I hope the words in the book can be a blessing to you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
