THE DIRE NEED AND SHORTFALL IN CHURCHES AND MINISTRIES AROUND THE WORLD TODAY IS THE QUEST BY LEADERS TO &quot;MAKE DISCIPLES&quot;. THIS SHORTAGE HAS TO A LARGE EXTENT MADE THE CHURCHES AND MINISTRIES DO EVERYTHING ELSE BUT DISCIPLESHIP. THERE IS A LOT OF UNTAPPED POTENTIAL WASTED IN CHURCH PEWS, SITTING UNPROVOKED, UNCHALLENGED UNTRAINED AND UNEQUIPPED AS DISCIPLES, PROBABLY BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP IS LACKING ON THIS FIELD.
THIS BOOK, BY APOSTLE MARK ESSIEN EXCEL SURE IS AN ANSWER TO SUCH DEPRIVATION. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A WORKBOOK OR TEXTBOOK ON DISCIPLESHIP, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST.
