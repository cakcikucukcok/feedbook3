  <title>Shut Up, Sit Down and Listen! - Jude One</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God wants His children to wake up, stand up and grow up!  This book contains poems covering various life experiences that affect God&#39;s children.  God wants us to behave responsibly, put away selfishness and make it our urgent business to save souls.  I&#39;ve included my personal account of how I kept resisting God and finally ended up painting myself into a corner.  My aim is to encourage  others who have not yet started a relationship with Christ, to get to know Him.   When we  try to live life without Him, we will never, ever experience true peace.  In recent years I found myself thinking more deeply about God and I wanted Him to tell me what He expects from His children, so I asked Him.  Well, imagine being woken in the early hours one  Saturday morning with the poem &#39;Shut Up, Sit Down and Listen!&#39; in my head. I picked up the note pad beside my bed, I held the pencil, but I was not the writer.
&quot;Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgment.  Jude One" />
