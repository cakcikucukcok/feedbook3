  <title>Faith by Size and Type - Lennox Anthony Blaides</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith is my writing this book and seeing 1000s of people come to faith in Jesus Christ; and making Him their Savior and Lord.  My expectations are so engrafted in my spirit that no one can convince me otherwise. &lt;p&gt;
This book is my faith-seed in the life of whosoever would read it; and I am believing God for a great harvest.  It is a collection of biblical stories and events highlighting the faith of individuals and showing its efficacy in a given situation.  The faith of the Canaanite woman; The man suffering with palsy; The woman with the issue of blood; The lame man who had faith to be healed; The faith of Abraham, Noah, Moses and Elijah; About Little faith; No  faith; Great faith; and more.   &lt;p&gt;
This book has been written with you in mind to help you grow in faith and understanding of the Word of God.  Jesus said in Matthew 13:19, If you do not understand what you hear (or read), the wicked one comes and snatches away that which was sown in your heart.  Hosea 4:6 says, My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.  &lt;p&gt;
Yes, Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God; and this book helps you to understand what you hear and read from the Word of God.  
&lt;p&gt;
Use this book to plant a faith seed in someones life, and watch God produce a harvest that they are able to share with others to the glory of the Lord.&lt;p&gt;
