  <title>Welcome Home - Carol Cox Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carol Taylor meets cancer for the second time in her life. It has been a formable enemy who has returned to displace, hurt, inconvenience and to ultimately destroy her life. Realizing the true enemy to be the Evil one who does by scripture says to come, kill and destroy and that this cancer to be a weapon formed against her, she learns to lean even heavier on her true help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faith for the journey through cancer is a must for the child of God. Through faith, strength is drawn from God Himself who is willing and wants to be close every step of the way. How shallow words seem to be when said that one believes in God and once trouble comes, fall apart. Fear is something from the Evil one. Fear is an emotion everyone has. Its when fear is greater than faith, it becomes a problem for the Christian.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Carol had to walk by faith alone on this trip through her cancer. Many times she had to concentrate on that one voice that spoke to her and have faith when she felt it to be silent. Several times she had to speak the words of Job, Though you slay me, yet I will trust You.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God is faithful and when, from the desire of the heart His child prays, show yourself strong through this trial, He answers in the most amazing way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
