  <title>Neighbors and Ne&#39;er-Do-Wells - D.H. Shearer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Neighbors and Neer-Do-Wells takes you back to the days of Jesus, to a time of faith in the midst of uncertainty, of unconditional love in the face of bigotry. Join the audience as Jesus tells the parables of the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son for the first time. Youll discover that then, as now, people of faith wrestle with what it means to put love into practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighbors and Neer-Do-Wells addresses such contemporary questions as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Why are parables interpreted in so many ways? &lt;br /&gt;
 How inclusive should I be in my dealings with others? &lt;br /&gt;
 How far should I go in helping a neighbor? &lt;br /&gt;
 How can religion get in the way of Gods compassion? &lt;br /&gt;
 How can I confront my own self-righteousness? &lt;br /&gt;
 What does my personal relationship with Christ have to do with anyone else? &lt;br /&gt;
 Is it possible to drift beyond Gods love? &lt;br /&gt;
 What advice is there for a parent whose adult child has strayed from the Christian faith? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neighbors and Neer-Do-Wells includes discussion questions with each chapter, making it ideal for individual and group studies.&lt;/p&gt;" />
