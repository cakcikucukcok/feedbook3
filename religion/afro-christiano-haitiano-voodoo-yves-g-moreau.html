  <title>Afro-Christiano-Haitiano-Voodoo - Yves G. Moreau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some Library of Congress Representatives placed AFRO-CHRISTIANO-HAITIANO-Voodoo (A. C. H. V.) under the category of scientific work!
Ms. Barrett (Literary Agent) acknowledged A. C. H. V.s objectivity!
Writers Literary Agency Representatives like the concept and found it unique.
Mr. C. H. Dodd Peters said &quot;a tradition may undergo alteration or distortion in the course of long transmission by word-of-mouth. . . . When . . . written, stands substantially unaltered; . . . test and control it by a careful and critical study of the documents which caught and fixed it at the earliest accessible stage of development [1].&quot;
In order to prevent alteration or distortion, one put in writing some of the elements found in voodoo (i.e., songs, prayers, tales, etc) that initiates and non-initiates heard. In passing, I did not intend to reveal any secrets initiates kept.
We strived to come to call voodoo AFRO-CHRISTIANO-HAITIANO. This project became important to me after learning from several sources some people have been looking for anti-Christ elements to destroy them. I planned to make necessary repairs.
* * *
We intended to present some questions many voodooists posed about voodoo and to transmit objective responses through AFRO-CHRISTIANO-HAITIANO-Voodoo (A. C. H. V.). One aimed at confirming the responses with studies conducted and empirical data; honoring voodooists who did not question voodoo. One worked to sustain the faith of those persons and to perpetuate the words of God.
One aimed at proving that God exists. This specially came to be more important when I heard on the radio (U. S. A.) most &quot;baby boomers&quot; asked whether God existed or not; if they have worked on Earth in vain.
Here, one planed to honor the major and minor spirits.
My work differs from the books of DOKTOR Snake (VOODOO SPELLBOOK) and Mrs. Denise Alvarado (THE VOODOO HOODOO SPELL BOOK).  In their books, they paid attention to spells.  I paid attention to spells and other matters in my book.  Mrs. Catherine YRONWODE&#39;s work entailed herb and root virtues or their inclusion in magic. (The title of her book is HOODOO HERB AND ROOT MAGIC.)  I paid attention to magic and other matters in book.  Mr. Milo RIGAUD&#39;s SECRETS OF VOODOO dealt with secrets of voodoo. Mine did not.
I included hundreds of lyrics to voodoo songs in my work and they, at the very least, render it unique." />
