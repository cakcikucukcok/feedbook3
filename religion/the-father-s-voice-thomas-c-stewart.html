  <title>The Father’S Voice - Thomas C. Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anyone watching can see in these latter days that our world is in turmoil. People are restless, uneasy, and not sure about the future, with the failure and unresolve of many of her leaders who are not able, because of political pressure and lack of fortitude, to stand and deliberate as their position of responsibility requires with our social unrest, broken homes, infidelity in relationships, and disrespect among family, community, business, and governmental relationships.
The devil himself is doubling his forces, doing all he can to steal, kill, and destroy everything that resembles the right, the righteous, the honest, and the prudent. We can see his influence in the hatred and cruelty of terrorism and the inhumane treatment by certain sects or groups, even religious ones, upon thousands and even millions of innocent people who just want to live peaceably, having their family members maimed, tortured, and even killed, seemingly just for sport. We see armies of religious factions that are recruiting and growing enormously with the express goal to annihilate and eradicate anyone or group that doesnt agree with their particular worship or lifestyle. Add this to the extreme climate changes, tsunamis, storms, earthquakes, global warming, etc., and we can see that our lives and our future are more than uncertain.
The Bible asks the question in James 4:1: Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members? The answer to this dilemma lies within the truth of God. Jesus stated in John 8:32: You shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free. Herein is the reason for this book. Wherever you find yourself in these last days, please know it is virtually impossible to know the truth and not be free." />
