  <title>Stranger to History - Aatish Taseer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Indispensable reading for anyone who wants a wider understanding of the Islamic world, of its history and its politics.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Financial Times&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aatish Taseer&#39;s fractured upbringing left him with many questions about his own identity. Raised by his Sikh mother in Delhi, his father, a Pakistani Muslim, remained a distant figure. &lt;i&gt;Stranger to History &lt;/i&gt;is the story of the journey he made to try to understand what it means to be Muslim in the twenty-firstcentury. Starting from Istanbul, Islam&#39;s once greatest city, he travels to Mecca, its most holy, and then home through Iran and Pakistan. Ending in Lahore, at his estranged father&#39;s home, on the night Benazir Bhutto was killed, it is also the story of Taseer&#39;s divided family over the past fifty years. Recent events have added a coda to &lt;i&gt;Stranger to History&lt;/i&gt;, as his father was murdered by a political assassin. A new introduction by the author reflects on how this event changes the impact of the book, and why its message is more relevant than ever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
