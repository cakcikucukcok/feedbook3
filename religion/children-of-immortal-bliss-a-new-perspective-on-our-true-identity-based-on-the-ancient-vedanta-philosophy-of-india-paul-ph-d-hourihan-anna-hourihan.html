  <title>Children of Immortal Bliss: A New Perspective on Our True Identity Based on the Ancient Vedanta Philosophy of India - Paul Ph.D Hourihan, Anna Hourihan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PRACTICAL TEACHINGS FOR PEACE AND FULFILLMENT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this clear introduction to the Vedanta philosophy of India, you&amp;#39;ll discover a new perspective that can bring inner peace, inner strength and improve your relationships for a happier life. This spiritual book written by Paul Hourihan, an American, introduces these ancient teachings in a way that Westerners, in particular, can easily relate to and understand.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why learn about the teachings of Vedanta? &lt;br&gt;- According to Vedanta, ignorance of our real nature is the cause of our suffering and grief. The practical application of this philosophy is the means to Self-discovery, integration and inner peace for those of all faiths and those with no particular faith. &lt;br&gt;- By stressing the universal truths common to all religions, they provide a unifying basis for mutual understanding and peace in a world increasingly fragmented by opposing beliefs. &lt;br&gt;- They provide a foundation for understanding why a moral and ethical life are necessary.&lt;br&gt;- This knowledge gives us the means for realizing our true identity as Children of Immortal Bliss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Using the teachings of the Upanishads, this study covers the main principles and core concepts of Vedanta and covers important subjects such as meditation, nonattachment. It also provides an overview of the mysticism of India and a summary of the Yoga system of thought, as well as the Bhagavad Gita, another key Vedantic scripture. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last section reveals the universality of these teachings through confirmations of great mystics from other traditions including Plotinus, Lao Tzu, Meister Eckhart and the Sufis of Islam.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vedanta shows the way to inner peace, harmony among all peoples, and respect for all life." />
