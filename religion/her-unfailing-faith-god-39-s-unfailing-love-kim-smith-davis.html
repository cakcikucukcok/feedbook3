      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She was nineteen years old, just finished her first year of college, and her future was overflowing with possibilities. Thats what she thought until that tragic night, the night when her future came to a screeching halt and her car was struck by a drunk driver. Nothing could have prepared her for the turn of events that quickly followed. Excruciating pain, paralysis, emergency surgery, and then the fateful words she had to hear. Im sorry, you will never walk again.Kay Loy Avers was now a paraplegic. Despair, anguish, fear, anger. Kay Loy was experiencing all these emotions. These emotions could have overcome her. However, she had an incredible Comforter by her side, and His love was unfailing. Read and experience the miraculous true life story of Kay Loy and see how time and again God showed His extraordinary power. Journey with her and be inspired by her faith in Jesus; be overwhelmed by Gods miracles. If youre faith needs strengthened, Kay Loys story will encourage you that God hears and answers ours prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the true life story of Kay Loy Avers Smith written through the eyes of her daughter, Kim Smith Davis. Her Unfailing Faith, Gods Unfailing Love, chronicles the physical, spiritual and emotional battles and victories that Kay Loy endured throughout her life beginning with a drunk driver paralyzing her at the age of 19. Kim Smith Davis shares intimate details of Kay Loys life and how through a tragic accident, Kay Loys spiritual walk with the Lord became closer as the Lord began to perform one miracle after another and how Gods love was unfailing. Although Kay Loy faced paralysis, multiple back surgeries, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Pulmonary Embolism, Crohns Disease, and much more, her faith never failed. Kay Loy Avers Smith clung to 2 Corinthians 4:16.&lt;i&gt; Therefore we do not lose heart. Though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day.(NIV)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
