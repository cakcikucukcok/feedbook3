  <title>Winning the War Through Prayer - C. Fred Dickason Th. D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;No more general, routine, and unfocused praying. This book lays the foundation for engaging in spiritual warfare by effective, pointed, biblically based prayer. Part I presents in the first chapter a solid theological foundation, treating worldview, the reality of the spirit world, and our resources. The next chapters show the place of prayer in warfare and delineate some strategies, tactics, and cautions. Part II suggests some pattern warfare prayers for personal, church, and world needs. Believers have used some of these very effectively to see the Lord intervene and remove oppression and obstacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Winning the War through Prayer is like a bucket of cold water thrown onto a largely lukewarm Church. For those who have already experienced the power of demonic forces and the triumph of Christ, this book will give them more practical knowledge of how to confront the enemy. For those who have ignored the biblical teaching about our invisible war, such readers will be jolted in to reality. Their eyes will be open to a new level of spiritual discernment and a new way of praying that is directed against the forces that seek to destroy us (Dr. Erwin Lutzer).&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In my evaluation, this book is the best presentation of biblical warfare praying that has been written. God has use Fred to write an articulate, doctrinally sound, biblical call to warfare praying that exceeds anything yet writtenan academic and biblical study, a very useable and much needed document (Dr. Mark I. Bubeck).&lt;/p&gt;" />
