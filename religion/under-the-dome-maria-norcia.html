      <meta name="description" content="I was guided to write this book to let the world know about the incredible messages, protection, and guidance that the Archangel Michael provides to each and every one of us through the help of God and the many other archangels.
Call upon him when you need protection for you or your family, help removing the fear that you have and removing the ego from your decisions, and to feel free of spirit and have total love for yourself, the world, and everyone around you.
I hope that you will call upon him in your everyday life and you will truly feel loved and at peace. He will be your protector.
The next time you hear the name Michael or Michelle or encounter someone with that name, try to remember what happened that day ,and for one reason or another there is a message there for you to hear. And remember to always thank your angels for their help and know that you are truly loved and protected." />
