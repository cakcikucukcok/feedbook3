  <title>Dry Markings - Thurston Quinch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In author Thurston Quinchs office there are two blank dry-erase boards. He uses these boards to scribble whatever messages the Supernature (Holy Spirit) sends to him. At first only enigmatic phrasings these messages grow into essays now presented here in &lt;i&gt;Dry Markings,&lt;/i&gt; a thematic collection of writings which finds validation in Jesus&#39; promise to tell the world more when it is able to receive it.  
&lt;p&gt;After His ascension, Christ left His Spirit to instruct us until His Second Coming. Thurston Quinch, an unsuspecting existential phenomenologist, claims to have been struck by some of this lighteningthough he clarifies the Spirit insists to manifest materially to all of us, but in degrees from simple fleshly responses to theatrical experiences up to that elusive intimate internal knowing the saints have written about. Quinton&#39;s prophesy, presented chronologically, offers a radical, at times seemingly blasphemous, alternative to the way Christianity is commonly understood.
&lt;p&gt;His premise is that the Spiritwhom he began to call Supernature when he first perceived it as a mere supernatural phenomenonis calling for a gleaning of the original truth out of the clutter of original rhetoric and mythological distortions. The truth will come out! Quinch unapologetically opposes what he considers pagan corruption by even modern relativism of the one, true faith." />
