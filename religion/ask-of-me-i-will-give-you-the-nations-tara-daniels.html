  <title>Ask of Me, I Will Give You the Nations! - Tara Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;How to bless the nations through the fullness of Gods grace by prayer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As God called Esther to intercede before the king on behalf of His people, so God is calling us as His radiant bride to stand in the gap through prayer for the nations, who are in  need of Gods surpassing grace.&lt;/p&gt;
And who knows but that you have come to this royal position for such a time as this? Esther 4:14&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Do you long to experience Gods grace afresh in your own heart and see God empower the Body of Christ to rise up and respond to the brokenness in our world with His grace, healing and blessing?  Whether you want to learn how to be in accord with Gods heart in prayer for the Church and the nations, or to continue faithfully interceding and seek new inspiration, this book is for you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In Ask of Me I Will Give You the Nations!&lt;/i&gt; You will find --&lt;br&gt;
	Honey from the Rock letters to inspire and refresh your soul with truth from Gods Word.  &lt;br&gt;
	Forty short prayers to lift before Gods throne in order to seize your destiny and bless the Body of Christ and one nation after another from the fullness of Gods grace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birthed out of Taras personal prayer life, the short prayers in these pages provide insight on how to pray the truth of Gods Word over your own life, the Church and the nations. We, as the Bride of Christ have the responsibility and privilege to draw near to our King and ask Him to extend His jeweled scepter of favor to the nations as He has done to us!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the King of the universe lead you into His chambers, into the privacy of His heart. Pour your heart out like water in the presence of your Lord In His time and in His way, He will answer you. Wait expectantly. Suddenly, His glory will be revealed on behalf of His people and the nations! It is then that you will realize, you have captured the heart of your King!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God longs to give His people the nations as our inheritance. He is saying, Ask of Me I will give you the nations! So let us rise up and take our royal positions in the Kings throne room. Shall we? Seize your destiny and intercede! &lt;/p&gt;" />
