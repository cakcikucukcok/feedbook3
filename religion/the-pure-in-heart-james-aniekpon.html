  <title>The Pure in Heart - James Aniekpon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Pure in Heart are truly the chosen ones who can and will behold the face of God here on earth and hereafter in glory, as revealed by Christ in the gospel.
Do you cherish unusual hatred, bitterness, and unforgiving spirit in your heart? Or do you condemn, criticise, and judge others after the flesh and walk in sight instead of faith? Then you need a new and pure heart, cleansed and holy unto God to fellowship with His Spirit and others and enjoy His abundant blessings. 
In this book, you will discover
	that every good thing and gift comes from God alone,
	that only those who have received the Holy Spirit and are living in righteousness and holiness in obedience to Gods Word are the pure in heart who shall behold God,
	that it is when the Word of God is ministered in faith and with power that wicked hearts and devils can be exposed and expelled, and
	how you can have a pure heart." />
