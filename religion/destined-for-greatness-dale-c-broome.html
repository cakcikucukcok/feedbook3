  <title>Destined for Greatness - Dale C. Broome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Destined for Greatness, author Dale C. Broome draws from her criminal justice education and prior job experiences, her observations working in the court system, and her own struggles and shortcomings as a society-labeled single parent to minority teenage boys. She has whipped these ingredients together with Divine revelations and the God-given promises anchored in Gods Holy Word to offer some Godly tools in the form of hope and encouragement to those filled with hopelessness and despairprimarily the youth! As a voice for the voiceless, she warns parents, those in authorityincluding judges, and all those who come in contact with young people to start seeing these young people through the lenses of God, for often they are not as they appear! Stop tearing them down with venomous words; instead, use this energy to build them up. They have been made in Gods image; they are fearfully and wonderfully made. According to Philippians 4:13, they can do all things through Christ who strengthens them. There is, indeed, greatness within them!&lt;/p&gt;" />
