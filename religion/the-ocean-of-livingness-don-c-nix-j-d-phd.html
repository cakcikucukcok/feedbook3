  <title>The Ocean of Livingness - Don C. Nix J.D. PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The unfolding of the Cosmos is a single, uninterrupted creative event from the Big Bang to us. Quantum Physics is telling us these days that the universe is not a collection of separate objects floating and colliding in space, but a single web of total inter-connection. Thus, there are no boundaries of time or space to hold a localized creativity. If creativity exists anywhere in the universe, it exists everywhere. Similarly, though science is not ready to go there yet, the entire Field of the universe is alive and awake. Because the
Cosmos is an absolute singularity, there cannot be localized life or localized awareness. The entire Field must exhibit these phenomena. These new ideas of Quantum Physics track, remarkably and rather minutely,
the ancient Hindu concept of Brahman, which the ancients formulated from direct observation and pure intuition. This should be humbling to
our present-day scientists, who are inclined to dismiss all aspects of human knowledge not obtained through their preferred procedures.
The singularity of the universe means that we exist inside an Ocean of Livingnessmiraculous, alive, creative, and conscious. The 77 poems in this little book are an attempt to write from within the new consciousness.
We are living in a time when our understanding of macro-reality is shifting radically. It is an interesting time to be alive on the earth." />
