  <title>God of Solution - Bishop Abdul K. Kargbo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Humanity is seeking for solutions in different areas of life. Some are sick and need to be healed; some have spiritual problems and need deliverance. Some have serious financial issues, and others may just dont know what to do with their lives because it has been from one difficulty to another. The list goes on. This book is meant to reveal and inspire the human race that God has a permanent way of solving our problems. He is our creator and maker of all things. No producer will find it difficult to fix his product no matter how damaging it may be.
There are different sources of solution, but Gods means of solution is the best and most reliable. Man may help you with selfish motives, and even the solution may not be as dependable as Gods. God has need of us. Thats why he created us. He gave us salvation as a free gift by sacrificing his only son. Once we received this great salvation in Christ Jesus, then we may consequently be a candidate for divine solution in every other area of our life: healing, deliverance, restoration, and all-around breakthroughs.
After salvation, God wishes above all things that we prosper and be in good health (3 John 1:2). We cant receive a godly solution to the problems of life until we surrender to God. We ought to show him that we are ready to serve him, and the change we need will be possible. For with God, nothing is impossible!" />
