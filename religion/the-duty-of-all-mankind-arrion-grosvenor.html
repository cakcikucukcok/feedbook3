  <title>The Duty of All Mankind - Arrion Grosvenor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wouldnt you like to know more about what Christianity looks like?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The scriptures referenced within, working with God&#39;s Spirit alone are all you need(1 John 2:27 NIV) but God who loves us goes a step further... 
God gives the role of a teacher(Ephesians 4:11 NIV) to speed up your spiritual tutelage due to the urgency created by living souls dying without Christ. The teacher role highlights scripture which in turn sheds light on other scripture to shows how these scriptures work together.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Yes, God did that just for you!&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;God provides a way for you to become a tree(Matthew 13:32 NIV), a way for you to mature and transition from a new born babe towards being part of a radiant church(Ephesians 5:27 NIV). 
Topics discussed are for the sole purpose of edifying the body(Ephesians 4:12 KJV), and who doesn&#39;t want to be edified?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;You?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;If you love your fellow man and wish to be used to edify others, this book will engage your wish. With color illustrations and diagrams this book takes a systematic look at what the &#39;The Duty of All Mankind&#39;(Ecclesiastes 12:13 NIV) is. Progressing through fearing God unto how we are to keep His commandments. Highlighted are a number of topics which aid us in the war for our minds and souls. Topics like purpose, unity, hope and transformation are but a few of the subject areas touched. Two of the featured subsections, &#39;Before and After Time&#39; and Construct of Time highlight how time or lack thereof molds the unfolding of an event. In turn shedding light on other portions of the Word and increasing our limited understanding of God. 
With every precept presented based and referenced in the Word of God, you are guaranteed either to learn something new or add to your knowledge of God. &lt;/p&gt;" />
