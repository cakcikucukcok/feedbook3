  <title>Tales of Forever: The Unfolding Drama of God&#39;s Hidden Hand in History - W. Kent Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;EXPERIENCE FIRSTHAND a fantastic journey of discovery beyond the veil of time and space&amp;mdash;a journey that will transform both you and your understanding of God&amp;#39;s control and faithfulness...&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;To anyone who cares&amp;nbsp;to investigate such matters, the history of our world reveals evidence of a remarkable drama of God&amp;rsquo;s control and faithfulness, involving many courageous people, exotic places, and milestone events. A sweeping tapestry of the ages, it is a drama played out on the stage of world history for all to see, yet ironically, it is one that, by God&amp;rsquo;s marvelous design, is quite literally hidden in plain sight&amp;mdash;sublimely obvious to some, completely veiled to others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Tales of Forever,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;which is actually two books presented in one volume, sets out to describe this subtle yet pervasive drama, and it does do so against the backdrop of five things, five&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;sacred&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;things&amp;mdash;The Ark of the Covenant, The Spear of Destiny, The Shroud of Turin, The Great Pyramid of Giza, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Septuagint Bible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Along the way, we encounter several more things, among them, an ancient prophecy&amp;mdash;a promise of &amp;quot;days,&amp;quot; which precisely foretold the Advent of Christ and which bears a striking similarity to the messianic chronology found in the book quoted most often by the writers of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The New Testament&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, we meet the man who was commissioned to tell the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Tales of Forever&lt;/em&gt;, a man set apart from all others who was said to have talked with God, face to face, having a conversation that took place not in any earthly realm but at the very pinnacle of Heaven itself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;All these elements, then&amp;mdash;a man and his heavenly conversation, a promise of &amp;quot;days,&amp;quot; an ark, a spear, a shroud, a pyramid, and a book, that is to say, everything needed to demonstrate God&amp;rsquo;s control and faithfulness&amp;mdash;have for the first time been forged into a single storyline, to tell the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Tales of Forever: The Unfolding Drama of God&amp;rsquo;s Hidden Hand in History&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
