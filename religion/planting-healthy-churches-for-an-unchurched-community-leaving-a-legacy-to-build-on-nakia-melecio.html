  <title>Planting Healthy Churches for an Unchurched Community: Leaving a Legacy to Build On - Nakia Melecio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Planting new churches is a dedicated response and reasonable service to fulfilling God&#39;s mission. This critical church planting is not only the focus of today&#39;s Christians, but it is also the theological and practical subject of numerous Christian studies that tout scripturally based work for shoring up today&#39;s church. Nakia Melecio is answering God&#39;s call to support local churches, both old and new, and the outcry of God&#39;s people in a heartfelt attempt through conferences, workbooks, websites, and many other substantive pathways for spiritual founding and healing. Church planting is necessary, but it is no easy feat. Nakia Melecio&#39;s ministry will help struggling churches to reinvent themselves and new churches to plant firmly and deeply on solid rock. Through steadfast diligence and unwavering faith, God&#39;s mission can and will be fulfilled. Nakia Melecio shares the vision of how to build a legacy and ultimately claim the victory-methodically, effectively, spiritually, and graciously. Publisher:" />
