  <title>Insight to Heal: Co-Creating Beauty amidst Human Suffering - Mark Graves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="•	What does healing mean for Christians and others in an age of science?  •	How can a person relate scientific findings about one&#39;s body, philosophical understanding of one&#39;s mind, and theological investigations about one&#39;s spirit into a coherent and unified model of the person capable of leading one deeper into one&#39;s soul? •	How does God continue creating through nature and direct one&#39;s wandering toward becoming created co-creators capable of ministering to others?  The reality of human suffering demands that theology and science mutually inform each other in a shared understanding of nature, humanity, and paths to healing. Mark Graves draws upon systems theory, pragmatic philosophy, and biological and cognitive sciences to distinguish wounds that limit who a person may become, and uses information theory, emergence, and Christian theology to define healing as distinct from a return to a prior state of being and rather instead as creating real possibility in who the person may become." />
