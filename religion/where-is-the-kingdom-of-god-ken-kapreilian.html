  <title>Where Is the Kingdom of God ? - Ken Kapreilian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Newly revised for 2016. Where Is the Kingdom of God? This book is written with the intent to deepen and enhance the understanding of this topic. The title of this book is from the following scripture; 20 Now when He was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, He answered them and said,  &quot;The kingdom of God does not come with observation; 21 nor will they say, &#39;See here!&#39; or &#39;See there!&#39; For indeed, the kingdom of God is within you.&quot;   Comments from readers:  &quot;Where Is The Kingdom Of God?&quot;, is a fact filled account that gives the reader Biblical references to find this answer. The Kingdom of God defines what God has given us through His Son, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Sharing what he knows and expressing it in terms that others may grasp, is a gift that Ken has been given. His thoughts about God&#39;s Word allow us an opportunity to better understand the message Christ was giving His disciples over two thousand years ago, that the Kingdom of God is in the believer.
