  <title>I Am I Am - Connie V. Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For many years I abused myself trying to do all I knew how to fit in.  Whether it was a family member or a close friend, I would find myself looking and trying to act a certain way to get a certain response, even though I knew I was different within.  The many challenges and circumstances I encountered over the years have become stepping-stones for where I am today.  Looking back all that I have gone through, even now I believe I would not change anything.  The things of this life have made me into vessel usable by God.  It took years of falling down and getting up and situations after situations to make me turn left or right or even make me stand still.  I am not a swimmer; when the water level came above the neck, I would panic and take in too much water and find myself going under, and I would find myself standing knee deep in water wondering when the water level had moved, and I would find myself waiting for the next move.  All the challenges and struggles became evidence as part of the Masters plan.  I now understand God uses life to form a special relationship between him and his creation.  He takes events of life to guarantee our success and place us in position for times such as these." />
