  <title>Kingdom Mentality - Oscar Pelaez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Kingdom Mentality is a book that God put in my heart a long time ago. I knew it was the perfect will of God for me to write this book, but I was waiting for Gods perfect timing so that it could be released in the right season. 
In the times that we are living in, many people are not resting in Gods peace because they do not spend enough time in Gods presence. Financial pressure is one of the biggest things that keep us too busy to make time for God. Satan uses many weapons to attack the mind of an individual in times of crisis, such as stress, anxiety, depression, discouragement about your calling, and probably the worst one is unbelief in the promises of God. 
If this is your case, then consider this book as a divine appointment of God for your life that will renew your mind, bring about the healing of your faith, and help you to believe that God has more for you because he is a god of second chances. The Bible says that all things work together for good for those who love God and are called according to his purpose. God loves you so much that he wants to take all your failures and disappointments and use them to bless others so what the enemy has meant for evil, God is able to turn it around and use it for good. 
The fact that this book is in your hands means that Godthe god of all provision, the god that has closed so many doors to bring you to the right dooris preparing you to enter into one of the best seasons of your life and that season will begin with one simple thing; that you believe that you qualify to have more because if you do not believe it, then your faith may have been burned down. Probably you have experienced a perceived failure, and you may need to hear the prophetic words that are contained in this book to bring the necessary healing of your faith. 
Maybe you have forgotten that no matter how bad your present situation looks, God is still in control of everything in your life. Maybe the godly kingdom mentality that you used to have is long gone because you have prayed, fasted, and chased the Lord and nothing changed, or maybe you feel like you cannot continue to live the Christian life anymore, but I have good news for you! God has been working behind the scenes to prepare you to begin a better life, and the only one thing you need to understand is that God works from the inside out, not from the outside in. 
The apostle Paul said in the book of Romans chapter 12, Lets be transformed by the renewing of our minds. As a teacher that moves in the prophetic word of knowledge, I am here to tell you that the worst is over for your life and the best is yet to come!
I pray that you meditate on the words of this book in the unity of the Holy Spirit of God so the godly mentality that was stolen in the garden from Adam and Eve will be restored when you see the power of his resurrection through the cross by Jesus Christ.
I pray that this book will help you to receive the necessary healing of your faith so you will be able to press on toward your destiny even through times of difficulty. I pray that your kingdom mentality will be renewed the way God did it from your mothers womb.
Cordially,
Pastor Oscar Pelaez" />
