  <title>Prayer Woman - Lill Odhigu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Luke 1:37 says: With God, all things are possible.
All things means all things. Regardless of your situation or condition, all things are possible to them that believe. God is waiting for you to turn your impossibilities into testimonies to the glory of God. Prayer Woman seeks to stimulate the faith of girls and women and help them to believe all that is written in the Scriptures. We have been called to glory and dominion. The world we live in today has been so infested with humanism and unbelief that the believers faith seemed to have been paralyzed; some choose to believe the report of ungodly men more than Gods report in His unfailing word.
Prayer Woman is for all women and girls in the family of God who want to take back their destiny from the controlling hands of the devil. It is for women who intend to stand in the gap for their families, churches, and areas of influence. Standing in the gap implies committing to enforce Gods will in our circumstances by speaking up and praying as the spirit of God directs us. Prayer Woman stirs us to pray and to also build our prayer vocabulary. 
Author Lill Odhigu explains that we have powerful spiritual weapons available to us including the name and blood of Jesus and the Word and Love of God among many others. By using Prayer Woman to help us with our prayers, we can reclaim the spiritual world waiting for us." />
