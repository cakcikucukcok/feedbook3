  <title>Ninveh - Shoshana Zimmerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thinkers and teachers throughout the generations, and particularly in the New Age, have focused on the individuals quest for the meaning of life; justifiably recommending, that we independently define from within, the meaning of our own life. Ninveh adds a concept which invites us to understand the meaning of human existence in a comprehensive context, in which the individual can more clearly define and shape the meaning of his own personal life. The components of Experiment, Experience and Experiencing   - as the interpretation of the meaning of existence of the individual and the collective, offers the readers an extensive contribution and a unique point of view, in light of which life may be-
	 A constant experience of inner strength  which joyfully shapes growth and development through learning and remembering
	Filled constantly with the understanding of the body as a dwelling, and the importance and desirability of getting to know its higher occupant
	Abundant  in relationships, brotherhood and commitment- and compassion for all
	Blessed in serenity, enriched with moments of calm and quiet even in the heart of the clamor
	Flowing in a continuous present, charged with meaning and rich with love, beauty, harmony and creativity
	Resplendent with insight concerning most of the daily questions - big and small..
