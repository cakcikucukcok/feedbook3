  <title>I Didn’T Want to Be That Girl! - Sue A. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How many times have we pointed a finger at EveGods first created woman, who took a bite of the apple after being tempted by a serpent? Although her name is only mentioned in four verses of Scripture, she was made infamous for her greatest debacle. We tend to blame her for our own personal dramas. Eve had everything; she lived in paradise, in a carefree, pain-free, sorrow-free world. In spite of this, she was unsatisfied, and she sinned. God, however, looked beyond her sin and pursued her as part of a bigger story. Surprisingly, He doesnt focus on her sin but rather considered her His bride, the bride of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building on the story of Eve, I Didnt Want to Be That Girl! A Look into the Life of Eve presents a Bible study designed for women and exploring a variety of topics. Author Sue Allen considers Gods silence, His goodness, our humility, our struggles with sin, and our need to learn to hear Gods voice. She also examines Godly womanhood, holiness, insecurity, motivations of the heart, restoration and forgiveness, and much, much more. This devotional offers eight weeks of personal, interactive, conversational-style Bible study with daily prompts leading to confession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We, as women, must recognize our need for a Savior, Jesus Christ and realize that we are all sinners, saved by Gods grace, and His grace alone. Just like Eve, we didnt want to be that girl. And despite our flawed pasts and imperfections, we have been created to be the bride of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through keen insight and real-life vulnerability, Sue Allen unfolds the true nature of what it means to be the bride of Christ. Whether you are happily single, contemplating marriage, or long-time espoused, her fresh wisdom will beckon you to join her in preparing your heart anew for the King of Kings. The bridegroom is coming! What a joy it is to get ready for Him together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tonya Riggle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pastors Wife and Bible Study Teacher&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second Baptist Church, Houston&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing Sue and her heart to have women embrace our inheritance that we have in Christ allows me to not only put my stamp of approval on this study, but to use it in our ministry to college athletes and our staff that ministers to these athletes. Sue Allens desire for women to live the abundant life in Christ is immediately noticed within minutes of being in her presence. Thank you, Sue, for your passion to study the Word and your love affair with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
