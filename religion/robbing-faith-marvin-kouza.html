  <title>Robbing Faith - Marvin Kouza</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Main character, Murphy Wilson who lived a slow moving normal simple yet boring life gets a change of pace on a Friday afternoon as he ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time.  As he makes his way in to his financial institute for a quick cash withdrawal he ends up finding himself locked in the bathroom as the Bank gets robbed.  His faith starts rolling in as he hears the moaning and whaling of cries through the white painted walls as the robbery becomes a mass murdering horror event.  After pleading with God, he becomes the only living survivor and finds himself running and hiding not only from the robbers who are linked to the Mexican Cartel, but also the police who think he was part to the bloody massacre.  
He calls on his most trusted family attorney, Ronnie to help him escape the country thinking he would be safe.  While driving in darkness in the trunk and rears of multiple vehicles up the coast of California, they make their un-mapped travel up to Vancouver. Later on, he becomes accompanied with his family, uncles, and cousins. The question of Faith continues to arise for Murphy, asking why he was the only survivor and making himself believe it would have been better if he died with the rest, now putting his whole family in jeopardy because the robbers have tracked him down with a bribed leak from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
Murphys long tiring adventure up the west coast shows that not even the richest or powerful people on this earth can steal ones faith.  As you read Robbing Faith, you will encounter not only Murphys inner intentions and encounter with God, but also with the victims and the sinful Gangsters who later convert.  For only the Bank gets robbed in this story, but faith lives to tell." />
