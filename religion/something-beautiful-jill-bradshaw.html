  <title>Something Beautiful - Jill Bradshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;We all suffer from a deficit. Somewhere in our lives we have felt the pain of rejection, a pain that doesnt go away easily. It is kept alive by ongoing difficulties we have in relationships with others. Yet we were made to love and be loved, and there is a deep instinctual longing in the human heart for love, acceptance, and worth.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In her book &lt;i&gt;Something Beautiful: Learning to Live Loved&lt;/i&gt;, author Jill Bradshaw shares her journey to find love in her life. Bradshaw uses her personal story to show how we struggle in a world that seems to be getting harder, colder, and more self-oriented. We harden our hearts to protect them, but in doing so we shut others out. But as youll see, there is hope. You will learn about a Christianity that goes deeper than theological knowledge, belief systems, and organised religion. Discover the One who longs for a close relationship with you, the God who longs to transform each life he touches into something beautiful and meaningful.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Something Beautiful: Learning to Live Loved&lt;/i&gt; shows that whatever your experience of Godthere is more. You are worthy of love, and he will help you find it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
