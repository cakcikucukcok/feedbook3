  <title>E Mail Devotions from the Heart - Patti Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The publication of &lt;i&gt;E Mail Devotions from the Heart&lt;/i&gt; is a dream come true for first time author, Patti Campbell. In the year 2000, she sent out a daily inspirational e mail to several people. Soon the distribution list grew, and it now contains over seventy names. These devotions, inspired by Pattis life and memorable stories she had read, became an important ministry. Many of Pattis readers forward the e mail to friends and relatives. It would be diffi cult to estimate how far her devotions reach and how many people are inspired by them each day.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Here are several responses from Pattis faithful readers:&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Patti, just thought that I would pass this along. The e mail you sent today, I forwarded to my best friend. Their son has a brain tumor and needs radiation and chemo. Thank you so much for saving my sanity every day!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Patti, what a beautiful devotion today. I think all too often we get caught up in things like work and school and house work, without taking the time to stop and appreciate the small miracles all around us. Thank you, Patti&lt;/P&gt;" />
