  <title>Experiencing God - Terry O&#39;Connor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Too many people today suffer silently. They bear up under and carry the weight of hurt, shame, and guilt. Constantly remembering what happened. Always thinking the best has passed them by. Hopelessness, worry, and the struggle with self-worth consume their days. Their farthest thought is that their tomorrows could be better than their yesterdays. They can&#39;t seem to look past the mistakes to reach for success on any level.
And then there&#39;s God! A loving God that is not only able but willing. He is able to heal and restore. He is willing to touch that life and make it whole. God Himself said in Psalms 46:10, &quot;Be still and know that I am God.&quot; These words are much more than a passing comment. They are an invitation that if acted upon will leave you Experiencing God.
God wants you to experience the joy, acceptance, and love He has for you. He wants you to have a knowledge of His love for you gained through experience. There is nothing like God revealing Himself on your behalf that results in restoration, healing, increase, and fulfillment such as you have never known. Today hear Him calling you out from underneath the weights of life. It&#39;s time to Experience God!" />
