  <title>What Are You Hungry For? - Lynn Ginsburg, Mary Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Women have many secrets. But a woman&#39;s secret relationship with food and her body can overshadow other aspects of her life, filling her with obsession, shame and fear.  Many women waste countless years focusing on food and appearance, rather than spending energy on what holds deepest meaning for them in life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;What Are You Hungry For?&lt;/i&gt; authors Taylor and Ginsburg show how obsessive dieting, a distorted body image and eating disorders are often symptoms of a deep spiritual void.  They offer a revolutionary--and easy to follow--approach to resolving deep-seated food and body issues using methods adapted from Eastern mind/body practices such as yoga.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What Are You Hungry For?&lt;/i&gt; is a discovery book in the tradition of  Susie Orbach&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Fat is a Feminist Issue&lt;/i&gt; and Geneen Roth&#39;s &lt;i&gt;When Food is Love&lt;/i&gt;.  It will change the way you think about your body and the way you approach preparing and eating every single meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Finally, an insightful book that ties together food and our spiritual practice &lt;i&gt;What Are You Hungry For?&lt;/i&gt;  provides both philosophical and practical ways to understand our relationship with what we take into our bodies and to how we are following our internal voices.&quot; --Rodney Yee, yoga teacher and star of the bestselling video series &quot;Yoga Journal&#39;s Yoga with Rodney Yee&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
