  <title>Can I Really Forgive - Eunice Frimpong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nearly every soul born of a woman in this world has been hurt by the actions or words of another[s]. Perhaps you might have been physically abused as a child; been raped either by a family member, a close pal or a total stranger, someone who spread vicious and humiliating lies about you, your parents put their own needs and egos way ahead of your basic emotional needs as a child, someone might have sucked the joy out of your life through his or her negative, hypocritical, phony, lazy, selfish, and ill-tempered behaviour, or through decades of an unfaithfulness in marriage, or Perhaps your mother criticized your parenting skills when you thought it wasnt even her style or even your partner had an affair. These wounds can leave you with lasting feelings of anger, bitterness and even vengeance, but if you dont practice forgiveness, you may be the one who pays most dearly. By embracing forgiveness, you embrace peace, hope, gratitude and joy.
To forgive is not that easy, but this book will give you an idea of and the encouragement to remove out areas you cannot forgive that have kept you from enjoying the best that God has to offer you. Learn what forgiveness is and what is not, uncover physical, emotional and spiritual consequences of un-forgiveness and see why God encourages you to forgive others.
I wish you all the best on route to forgiveness. May the favour of God be upon you. Amen." />
