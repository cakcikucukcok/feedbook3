  <title>When No One Is Watching - Dennis Simonich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is in the everyday and the mundane tasks of life that we become who we arein the split-second decisions, in the moments we prove what we stand for, how we treat others, and the values we hold no matter the circumstances. It is in the shared experiences with those who have walked life in front of us that we learn the values and traits that define our actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character, by definition, is the attribute that makes up or distinguishes an individual. Often it is difficult to describe yet instantly becomes recognizable in ones attitude, feelings, actions, responses, and behavior. Character is a choice, and those who daily choose it display integrity, trust, loyalty, dependability, and leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author identifies seven character traits, or life values, that have been passed down through four generations and are currently being taught to the fifthtraits learned through hard times and positive experiences of the author and his ancestors. Through his stories of life growing up in Montana to the day-to-day experiences in his career, raising children, and his relationship between his own son and grandson, the reader sees years of inner character in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Character is measured by what one does when no one is watching. It is an outward expression of a persons inner values. These traits are not inherited or inborn; they are accepted, learned, practiced, and in time, become habit. Inner character traits are those qualities that make a person distinctive and help to shape families, friends, and societies. When our days on earth are done, the most important gift we leave to those coming after is our legacy. Will yours be a life of character?&lt;/p&gt;" />
