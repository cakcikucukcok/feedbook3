  <title>Inner Strength Quiet Resolve - Timothy D. Etson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scores of publications have examined and expounded on the African American experience. In his debut collection of essays, speeches, and poems, Tim Etson reflects on racial injustice, Christian leadership, and the power of love. His compilation of inspirational, social, and political writings celebrates African American leaders of the past while exhorting todays generation to honor its heritage and build on that foundation for the future. 
He weaves biblical themes throughout his commentaries, reminding us that with freedom comes responsibility and that the road to success involves sacrifice, courage, and sometimes resistance to the popular view. He calls on the black community to nurture its youth, set positive examples, and teach children never to give up in spite of obstacles. From slavery to Jim Crow to anti-affirmative action laws, Etson points out hypocrisies of an American society in which inequities still exist. 
In &lt;i&gt;Inner Strength, Quiet Resolve,&lt;/i&gt; Etson expresses hope in the inner strength and resilience that have brought African Americans thus far and will continue to propel people forward in the twenty-first century." />
