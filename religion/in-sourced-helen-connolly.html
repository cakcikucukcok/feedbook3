  <title>In-Sourced - Helen Connolly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As I finished reading this manuscript, I felt greatly uplifted by the high consciousness and spiritual energy embodied in it. Helens metaphors resonate on many levels. Metaphor is the language of the soul, and the soul is speaking here. As Helen states over and over again, this book was written not by her but through her. I feel honored and blessed to know Helen and to recommend this book to all her readers.&lt;br&gt;
From the Foreword by Christina Thomas-Fraser, MA,  www.innerlightinstitute.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you satisfied with your life? Have you done everything you are supposed to do in the pursuit of success and happiness, yet find yourself feeling strangely empty and disillusioned? Would you like to experience more joy in your day to day existence? Would you like to feel unconditionally loved and supported?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step is to realize that the source of all the answers you seek is found within. In a world that outsources everything, constantly seeking gratification, stimulation, and validation from an external focus to fill the gap in life, please know this: You are a self-contained unit of the divine. Outside mentors and resources like this one may point the way and inspire, yet you are the destination you seek. To discover the truth of who you are and for lasting fulfillment in life In-Source your awareness through meditation and contemplation; dont put all your eggs in the outsourcing basket. Its fragile and by itself it never fulfills for long. Every single thing in form began its existence in formlessness. Meditation is the gateway to such an infinite resource and blissful experience of your true nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is my invitation to you to be your part, to be who you truly are, to drop your illusory stories, and play with me in original innocence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
