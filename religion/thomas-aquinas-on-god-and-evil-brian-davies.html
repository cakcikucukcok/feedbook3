  <title>Thomas Aquinas on God and Evil - Brian Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brian Davies offers the first in-depth study of Saint Thomas Aquinass thoughts on God and evil, revealing that Aquinass thinking about God and evil can be traced through his metaphysical philosophy, his thoughts on God and creation, and his writings about Christian revelation and the doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation.   Davies first gives an introduction to Aquinass philosophical theology, as well as a nuanced analysis of the ways in which Aquinass writings have been considered over time. For hundreds of years scholars have argued that Aquinass views on God and evil were original and different from those of his contemporaries. Davies shows that Aquinass views were by modern standards very original, but that in their historical context they were more traditional than many scholars since have realized.  Davies also provides insight into what we can learn from Aquinass philosophy. Thomas Aquinas on God and Evil is a clear and engaging guide for anyone who struggles with the relation of God and theology to the problem of evil." />
