  <title>Bediuzzaman Said Nursi: Wonder of the Age - Ramazan Balci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In the many dimensions of his lifetime of achievement as well as in his personality and character, Bedi&amp;uuml;zzaman Said Nursi (1877&amp;ndash;1960) was and, through his continuing influence, still is an important thinker and writer in the Muslim world. At a time when science and philosophy were tools of an aggressive ideology of secularism, Nursi strove for the revival of an Islamic consciousness. Even though his nonviolent stance was clear, he was seen as a potential danger and exiled to different corners of Anatolia. During the exile, he started writing his magnum opus &amp;ldquo;Risale-i Nur&amp;rdquo; (Epistles of Light), by which he aimed to guide people to the truths of faith and make them understand the Qur&amp;rsquo;an correctly. This book provides a summary of this hard but fruitful life, spent in the way of faith.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
