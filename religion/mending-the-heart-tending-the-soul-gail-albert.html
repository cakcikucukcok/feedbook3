  <title>Mending the Heart, Tending the Soul - Gail Albert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although few of us know it, ancient tradition says that the Bibles first five books can be read as an extended parable describing the personal spiritual journey. In Mending the Heart, Tending the Soul, Gail Albert traces a universal path of psychological and spiritual growth as she takes us on this journey.  Offering interpretations, contemplative meditations, and her own experience in this clear, practical, and heartfelt guide to each section of scripture, she brings the wisdom of the spiritual path into our daily lives as she travels with us each step of the way from Genesis through Deuteronomy.
Praise for 
Mending the Heart, 
Tending the Soul
Dr. Albert has done a marvelous job in demystifying profound subjects in a way that opens gateways to hidden mysteries for readers of all backgrounds.Highly recommended for all spiritually oriented readers.
Rabbi David Cooper, 
author of God Is a Verb
Albert takes us slowly, contemplatively, through the layers of meaning these stories offer. We are brought into the mystery of scripture ever deeper.For those who enter the journey, these sacred stories take on new, and potentially life-changing, vitality.
Brian C. Taylor, 
author of Becoming Christ:
