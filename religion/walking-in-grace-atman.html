  <title>Walking in Grace - Atman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most trips are pre-planned and focus on the external  the tediousness of the plane ride, the luxury of the ocean cruise, the quiet of the countryside, the mustiness of the old cathedral. Atmans previous travels were just like that. But her backpacking journey throughout Spain was much more. First, any previous backpacking had consisted of merely carrying a backpack from bus to hotel. Second, for this trip, she made no plans. She was called to be there.
Walking in Grace is Atmans day-to-day journal of her journey within, as she backpacks the Camino de Santiago. The book is filled with questions and answers, synchronicities, lessons learned, and healings carried out. For Atman is an empath  she picks up others energies from their bodies and can sense what ails them  whether physical or emotional. It doesnt always leap at her right away, but becomes known to her quietly or occasionally, after asking the Universe she will receive a sudden revelation. She can lay her hands on someone in physical pain or suffering from a disease and by working with their energy becomes the conduit for healing, yet, she is humble about it. 
She is also humble about this book and only decided to publish it after several friends separately suggested she do so. She calls herself a pilgrim. This book is her truth." />
