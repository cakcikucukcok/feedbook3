  <title>How Satan Fights - Mark Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How Satan Fights&lt;/i&gt; offers a unique military intelligence analysis of how Satan and his demonic army will wage war against mankind, using the same unclassified intelligence process that is used by the US Armys military intelligence corps today. Author Mark Kelly is a Christian who served as a tactical intelligence officer for thirteen years; he now presents an investigation of the war from biblical times through today, providing a deeper knowledge of our enemy, Satan. He explains the combat strength of Satans demonic army, their arrangement on the battlefield, their political and military command structure, their strengths and weaknesses, and their mission on earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With analysis based on information found in the Holy Scriptures, &lt;i&gt;How Satan Fights&lt;/i&gt; considers what Satan intends to do with God if he wins the war. Kelly reveals Satans military doctrines and explores how he has used these doctrines from the time of Adam to the present day. More important, he demonstrates that Satan uses the same tactics of yesterday against the faithful Christians of today. Through this study, you can gain increased understanding of the war that Satan waged against Jesus and the apostles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This war is real, and it is being waged all around us. We must understand our enemy and his tactics if we, through the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, are to defeat him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
