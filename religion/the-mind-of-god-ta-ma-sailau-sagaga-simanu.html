  <title>The Mind of God - Ta ma Sailau Sagaga- Simanu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We live in times of renewal, refl ection and recycling. There are energies and
forces directing people in numerous ways. What is the driving force behind
our worlds projects and systems of development?
It is the hidden Sacred Mind of God present in creation. It is the mediating
voice and the micro communication device in peoples minds around the
globe and universe. It is the mind of God in Nature. It is Gods innovative
and omnipotent mind, protecting and balancing our world for continuity
and sustainability.
In this book, I am delving a little into the thoughts assortment of Gods intellectual
sanctuary, which intrigues us all contemporarily. This is partly experiencing,
viewing, seeking and imagining God through watching TV, movies, listening
to radio broadcasts, and reading newspapers, e.g. on tsunamis and climate
change conferences, the debates on God by some ecumenical preachers, etc
etc, informing us all about the awe that is permeating the atmosphere and the
environment, not just adversely, but bringing hope and attention to the state
of our world.
The main inspiration in this work, is how does God think ? Is the pool of
our mindsets, a reflection of Gods intellectual sanctuary? Does God reply
to our prayers in a similar way to our way of responding to our childrens
cries and wants?
In Part 1, a discussion is attempted about the different connections and wealth
of existing legal derivations about Gods Mind, since the beginning of time.
(viz, RSV Bible). This affi rms the common view that a super pluralistic mind
exists, belonging to God, beyond the collective of Nature and humankind.
As well, I am sharing my hypothesis on a possible composition of YHWHs mind
using the outcomes gathered from around, and evidence experienced daily.
e.g. climate change, IT interference, spyware and viruses, literature and media.
My hypothesis is simply a great pool of imagination tested daily, emerging to
provide a theoretical basis for research. I feel that anyones perception of our
universe is a legitimate entry to further discovery and research.
Part 2 exposes some innovation on how the Sacred Mind of God manifests
itself in the multi-religious isms of today. Religion indeed is only a part of Gods
wisdom and mind which we use intensively daily, to explain our experiences of
the Sacred and the Profane. What is paramount in modern times is the love of
God for all creation, especially human beings. Why does Gods love and Mind
operate so differently from human experiences?
Part 3 looks at the future, with respect to secular philosophy and human
piety, critical thinking, new discoveries, and prophecies currently affecting
us all. For example, Heaven is here with us on earth, just as much as the
Spirit God abides in humans on earth.
The fi nal opinion at the rear of the book is about the word mind  as a simple
construction currently used to describe the awesome intellectual sanctuary of
God. On its own, the word seems not pious enough to describe the power and
divinity of Gods super-brain-network. Am I trying to equate Gods Intellectual
Sanctuary with our simple human minds?. No, just using our minds as the best
resource to understand God and its Mind.
We need a better word(s), to describe the plurality but solitude of Gods
thinking realm.
I have given it the phrases, the Sacred Mind of God, or the Intellectual
Sanctuary of God.
The phrases imply defi nitive tapu boundaries which are self-explanatory.
God did put a mind into every form of creation, humans as well as other
forms of animals, fi shes, and vegetation. Creation includes the mountains, the
oceans, the seas, winds, rivers and all that we can see and perceive, even the
minutest creations like the ants, pests, germs and viruses.
The Intellectual Sanctuary of God is not the same as the human mind, and it
affi rms the notion that God exists, with a mind beyond our understanding.
