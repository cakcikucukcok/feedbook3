  <title>James in the Suburbs: A Disorderly Parable of the Epistle of James - April Love-Fordham, Stephen A. Hayner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you consume God&#39;s blessings, or do you share them? Most Christians are consumers. We are obsessed with knowing the right theology and following the right set of rules in hopes that God will bless us. Yet, no matter how much God blesses us, we are still looking for more. James says our faith is dead. But there is another type of Christian, one who craves being put to work as the servant of God to share God&#39;s blessings with others. Their faith spurs them on to become the hands and feet of Christ. James says their faith is alive.  James in the Suburbs is far more than your ordinary Bible study guide. It is also a parable--an energizing story of the lives of six men and women--that wraps itself around the Epistle of James, making its teachings immediately applicable to modern life. You will walk away with not only a thorough understanding of the epistle, but also the unforgettable story of people just like you, whose lives the Holy Spirit turned upside down.  This book can be read casually by an individual or studied within a group. The final chapter provides everything readers need for a guided twelve-week study." />
