  <title>For We Know in Part - Stephen Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Two new words for a Tolerance-hungry vocabulary.  Homosexuality is now Homonaturality.  Heterosexuality is now Heteronaturality.  Let&#39;s take the sting and abuse out of words that have become too narrow and too negative.  -  If you are a relative or friend of a gay or lesbian who has just come out to you, you may be wrestling with faith and conscience.   You may be facing a conflict between what you thought you knew about the H-word and the character of the person you&#39;ve known and loved for so long.  Read this collections of pamphlets assembled in this book, some serious, some humorous, and some facetious, and let your mind decide to go with love.  Then watch everything fall into place even if you feel your Bible and yhour church are pulling you in another direction.  Find out how those who have sought to defend inerrancy and inspiration down through the centuries have almost always been on the back-side of progress, left behind by public opinion, hurrying to catch up with the rest of the world, and yet . . . still unwilling to concede their error until surrender is absurdly too little, too late." />
