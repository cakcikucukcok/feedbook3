  <title>God’S Plan for Abundant Living - David R. Finch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a presentation of five fundamental and biblical-based principles by which God would have us live our lives. They are not original to me, only discovered by me. They came out of a nine-hour seminar that had been developed in the 1980s. It is organized by each individual principle along with several chapters which illustrate how these principles can be applied to our financial circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To illustrate these principles, they are likened to the building of a house. Each principle represents a step in the process of building a house. At the end of each principle, as well as each chapter, there is a personal application which I hope will help people apply that principle/chapter to their personal lives.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The book is organized from start to finish on the concept that we are human beings created by a God who have given us a plan by which to live our lives, a plan that goes beyond the materialistic focus of most people in the world today. It is a book for persons who are willing to discover how God can direct their financial lives to be fulfilled according to His plan, which in turn will provide them with a level of fulfillment that can only be found by following His plan.&lt;/p&gt;" />
