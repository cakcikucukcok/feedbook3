  <title>Prayers That Move the Heart of God - Mr. Calvin Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote this book as an inspiration to touch the lives of Gods greatest asset- His people- That He so dearly cares about with all of His heart. An external picture of something says a million words. An external picture opens the facts of what may be true and sincere or maybe it is a figment of our imagination. The spirit of a man or woman is what truly reveals the true nature of a person not necessarily what you view on the outside. Whatever is on the inside will surface on the outside, whether good or bad. God is concerned about the inside of a person and longs to bring life to a spirit that has been wounded by life itself- This book was written to resuscitate the spirit of that man or woman that is just existing in life and not living life to the fullest because of a broken spirit. This book will inspire one with hope, faith, love, and a new perception in life, and once you are blessed you will desire to help change that person in your life that needs a spiritual transplant. God will richly bless you as you read and apply these inspirational readings to your daily life." />
