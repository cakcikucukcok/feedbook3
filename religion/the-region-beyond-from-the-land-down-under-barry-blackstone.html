  <title>The Region Beyond: From the Land Down Under - Barry Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Have you ever wondered what it would be like to travel to a far-off and distant place to share with an unreached people group the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ? The Region Beyond is a journey with two young cousins to the remotest mission station in the world in 1972. Travel with Barry and Bob Blackstone from northern Maine to the Gibson Desert of western Australia to experience another culture and climate far beyond their imagination or expectation. Experience with them their first overseas flight across the width of the great Pacific; journey with them into the barren wilderness that is central Australia on a day-and-a-half railroad ride; fly with them through the interior of western Australia were mile after mile is nothing but flat, open wasteland; work with them on a million and a quarter acre sheep and cattle station and witness up close and personal the struggles of such a hostile land; drive with them deeper into the desert to an isolated community of Aboriginal natives and a few missionaries, three hundred miles--north, south, east, or west--from any other settlement; and share with them the ups and downs of living in a strange land for a summer.  Their spiritual adventure will include a kangaroo hunt, dust storms that blotted out the sun, teaching aboriginal children the Story of Jesus, building a laundry and shower building in the heat of a hundred degree Australian winter, catching--by running after a caboose--a train heading east at a desert junction, watching a tribal fight with spears and knives, experiencing the hospitality of fellow believers unmatched until the author visited India. Learn what it takes to be a missionary to The Region Beyond, and discover your life&#39;s calling despite the desire to return. On the fortieth anniversary of this miraculous trip, Pastor Blackstone recalls the events that made this memorable summer of &#39;72 possible, and the lasting effects of his journey into The Region Beyond!" />
