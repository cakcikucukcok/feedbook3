  <title>Medicine Wheel of My Recovery - Mickey M.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is not only for Native American Indians; its for all races, but in the Native American way. Nor is this book directed to any one particular recovering group. The disease of addiction is not a prejudice disease. neither is recovery.
Everything we do in recovery should be for self, because everything we do effects our opinion of ourselves. The results of sobriety should be used to help others in recovery. The secret of success is consistency. Thats why in recovery they keep saying, Keep coming back. To sacrifice is to gain, in giving up the past for the future. Wisdom is not what you put yourself through but what life puts you through.
Accepting recovery is accepting responsibility for ones actions. This is why we must know where the ripples will go before we cast the stone into the pond. To do so, one must take a journey within the four directions, in order to find the balance of their spiritual inner and outer self. The results should be given away to help others in recovery so that we may keep what we have learned and earned, so that we will be able to have a deeper yes and a much stronger no, and realize that the message is in silence, the deepest answer is in patience, and a clear mind will precipitate patience.
