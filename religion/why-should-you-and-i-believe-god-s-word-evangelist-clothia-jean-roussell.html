  <title>Why Should You and I Believe God’S Word? - Evangelist Clothia Jean Roussell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Evangelist Clothia Jean Roussell was called by God in July 1993, after having completed three years of study for her degree in the education field. Details of the call will be publish in her upcoming book entitled, The Lord Called Me. While glancing over her study notes for a test she was about to take, she heard the Spirit of God speak very clearly. He said, Jean, I am calling you from the education field over to My Gospel field as an Evangelist. In 1993, after hearing and accepting the call of God, she was then led by the Spirit of God to Tulsa, Oklahoma. There she attended Rhema Bible Training Center and Rhema Bible Church, under the leadership of the late Prophet Kenneth E. Hagin and Pastors of Rhema Bible Church, Kenneth W. and Lynette Hagin Jr. While there, she recall three highlights of her studies: (1) how to walk by faith (Gods Word), (2) how to hear and yield to the Spirit of God, and (3) how to walk in the God-kind of love, which she determines to exemplify in her everyday walk of life. She graduated from Rhema in 1996 after completion of her two-year study in Ministerial studies as an Evangelist. She is an active alumnus of Rhema and currently holds credentials and license as an Evangelist under ICCM (International Congress of Churches and Ministers), with Dr. Michael Chitwood as Founder/CEO. They are located in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Evangelist Roussell travels from state to state as the Spirit of God leads her, proclaiming the Good News of the Kingdom of God and the Name of Jesus, with genuine signs following in Jesus Name as the Holy Spirit wills. She also operates in the Gifts of the Spirit only as the Holy Spirit wills. She is a Visionary, Author, Psalmist, Song Writer, Motivational &amp; Inspirational Speaker, Poet, Preacher, Teacher, Fashionista and Serial Entrepreneur. She is a native of New Orleans, Louisiana, but has been residing in the state of Georgia for the past 16 years. She is happily wed to Mr. Michael A. Roussell for the past 36+ years and a proud mother of two young adults, Michael A. Roussell Jr. and Renaulda Roussell Hayes." />
