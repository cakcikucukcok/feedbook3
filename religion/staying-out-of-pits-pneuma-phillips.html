  <title>Staying out of Pits - Pneuma Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Staying Out of Pits: A Revelation of the Victory is the second of three books written by Pneuma Phillips. It is a continuation of the first book, Out of the Pit: The Work of Grace (if you have not read it, we suggest you do). We averred that though we were once in a pit of sin, God had saved us by pulling us out (Psalm 40:13, KJV; Colossians 1:1314, MSG) through the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In this book, we recognize different pits we do not need to accept: the pit of sin, self, failure, fear, hell and Hades, sicknesses and diseases, poverty and lack, curses, religion, and pit of death (Exodus 7:112:40).
God wants us to know that, by the sacrifice of Jesus, we have victory. An understanding of this victory will help us stay out and enjoy victory over every pit, such as sin (Romans 6:11, 14, NLT), self (Matthew 16:2425, ISV), failure (Thessalonians 1:11, MSG), fear (John 14:1, NLT; 2 Timothy 1:7, MSG), hell and Hades (Matthews 25:3234), sickness and diseases (Isaiah 53:45, MSG), poverty and lack (2 Corinthians 8:9, NLT), curses (Galatians 3:1314, MSG), religion (Romans 10:13, MSG), and death (1 Corinthians 15:5557, MSG).
We therefore rejoice always because we have the victory over every pit. We stay in our victory by constantly looking unto Jesus and depending on God. How? In 1 Corinthians 10:1315, Romans 6:11, and Galatians 5:16, we learn five key things. God is faithful, so God does not allow us to be tempted beyond what we can bear. He has made a way of escape so we reckon ourselves dead to sin but alive in Christ. Thereafter, we must yield to the Spirit not to gratify the desires of the flesh or experience the limitations of any pit." />
