  <title>The Abcs of God’S Infallible Grace - Jennetta Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Pastor Jennetta Harris eloquently delivers a clear illustration of Gods grace in this wonderful book and provides great insight from A to Z. It offers hope, encouragement and enlightenment to many!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Lisa Marie Hopkins, Minister of the Gospel&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To know grace is to have experienced and received unmerited forgiveness. This book definitely encapsulates the fullness of Gods grace.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Barry E. Knight, Founder, Barry E. Knight Speaks, Lead Pastor, Celebration Worship Church&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Harris has given the reader more than a mere glimpse or a cursory look at Gods grace, but a well thought out, planned and presented picture of grace personified in Jesus Christ Our Lord. Each of the 26 chapters stand independently as they also stand collectively.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;-Tommy Morrow, MA, Senior Pastor, Victory Community Church Upland, CA&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ABCs of Gods Infallible Grace is the embodiment of many lessons my mother instilled in my sister and I from a very young age. This book is both genuine and uplifting and I couldnt think of a more credible woman to share her work with the world.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-Elijah Harris, Son&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This piece is truly a milestone in not only my mothers life, but inherently in mine. Her commanding presence, endearing heart and teachable moments are now being shared with you.  Her writing on Gods grace is both fluid and inspiring and Ive watched her live in it.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;-Jennell Harris, Daughter&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;The ABCs of Gods Infallible Grace is a phenomenal book! An epic guide that provides daily direction of Gods will for us and written by an anointed, faithful and true woman of God! Praise to Pastor Jennetta Harris.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
