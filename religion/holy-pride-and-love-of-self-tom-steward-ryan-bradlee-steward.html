  <title>Holy Pride and Love of Self - Tom Steward, Ryan Bradlee Steward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover a sons true beauty and how he impacted others, and also how this young man succumbed to the powers of addiction, losing his life to an unexpected drug overdose. The story does not end there; experience how heaven invaded a situation that could have left everyone hopeless. It was here that the love and grace of God began to shine through with a penetrating light. As in his two other books, &lt;em&gt;Into Solitary PlacesOne Fathers Journey of Faith Through His Sons Struggle with Psychotic Mental Illness&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;True MindHow Truth Can Change What You Believe and How You Live&lt;/em&gt;, Tom Steward has written another revealing account of how lifes struggles do not have to defeat us or define us. We see once again how there is a way to transcend any human experience and emerge as victors. See how our affliction is eclipsed by glory, the eternal weight of glory that is far beyond comprehension. Toms ability to capture human experience, from the painful to the glorious, draws the reader into the many and varied experiences of life. He is not bashful to assert that God is always involved, no matter the circumstance, and that there is always a redemptive conclusion, although it may be difficult to see. This book will arouse the power of hope in you as you gain the courage to carry on, regardless of lifes challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
