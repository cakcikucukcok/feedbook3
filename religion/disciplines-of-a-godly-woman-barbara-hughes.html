  <title>Disciplines of a Godly Woman - Barbara Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discipline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For many of us, the word alone evokes dread. It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t want to be disciplined physically, mentally, and spiritually. The challenge seems too hard, and the motivation more about duty than desire. When it comes to our Christian walk, we don&#39;t want to be legalistic and just follow some set of rules. That&#39;s not what it&#39;s all about, right?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Barbara Hughes answers with this encouraging reality: The true heart of spiritual discipline is a relationship with God. As you grow in that relationship, embracing your heavenly Father and his ways, you discover that discipline is your lifeline to him. It is how he gives meaningful shape to all the days of your life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &quot;dread&quot; of a disciplined life will be replaced with desire and anticipation as you find that there is no greater purpose than loving Him in every moment, every activity, and every thought. Using poignant stories and faithful reminders, Barbara opens her own heart to help you find the joy of full surrender. Her honest and encouraging look at the Word of God reveals the keys to living a truly godly life. And to strengthen your walk day to day, she offers hymns and praise psalms for your devotional times, a long list of recommended books that will lift your spirits, and Bible study helps to remind you that you&#39;re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
