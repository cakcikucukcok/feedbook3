  <title>Journey to the Fatherless - Lawrence E. Bergeron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Journey will challenge you to  find the kind of life you have always wanted to discover.&lt;br /&gt;
Tom Davis, President of Children&#39;s Hope Chest and author of Fields of the Fatherless, Scared and Priceless&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The global orphan crisis is too serious to ignore, the biblical call is to plain to miss. I&#39;m thrilled to see Journey to the Fatherless!&lt;br /&gt;
Tony Merida, author of Orphanology, and Lead Pastor, Imago Dei Church and Associate Professor of Preaching, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journey will move a church from thinking to action in responding to the needs of fatherless children.&lt;br /&gt;
Jayne Schooler, author of Wounded Hearts, Healing Homes and The Whole Life Adoption Book &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Journey to the Fatherless is life-changing &lt;br /&gt;
Paparao Yeluchuri, President, Missions to the Nations, India&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOES THE CHURCH CARE FOR THE WORLDS CHILDREN? The evidence on display tells a troubling story with an ever-increasing number of orphans in the world, kids aging out of foster care, AIDS babies in Africa, and toddlers in Haiti whose hair has turned orange from severe protein deficiencies. What makes this situation especially tragic is that given our wealth, talent, and resources, the Church can be a powerful agent of changeand we have the biblical mandate to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do Christians have a responsibility to intercede for and sacrifice their resources for vulnerable children? What happens to the Church when we do? And when we dont? How do we begin? &lt;br /&gt;
The Journey to the Fatherless is written by a former agnostic, corporate executive and inventor who was chased down by the Hound of Heaven. God then took him to the fields of the fatherless so he could experience what breaks the heart of God. What he discovered in serving the least of these has been captured for the Church to use to prepare others for their journey. The Journey takes the reader beyond Fields of the Fatherless and The Hole in Our Gospel into a deeper understanding of the problem and the biblical call to action.&lt;br /&gt;
