  <title>Job’S Belief and Faithfulness Rewarded by God - Dr. Sylvia Harden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MY STORY
	I was born in Waynesboro, Georgia to the proud parents, Annie Miller and Smith Biggens. My mother had 10 children, having been married twice. My brother, sister and I were the three children born to her second husband. My paternal grandmother was named Sylvia, therefore, my father thought it was befitting to name me after one so dear to his heart. At age 16 my parents passed away. In 1946, I married Lenier Harden and out of that union I was blessed with four girls and one boy. As time passed, I came to New York and obtained a sleep-in job as a housekeeper earning wages of $37.00 per week caring for two adults and two children for approximately two years. Again, as time passed, I sent for my children who had remained in Georgia and brought them to New York to reside with me. At that time we lived in one room with no cooking facilities for six weeks. I prepared meals for my family at the job where I worked daily and sent the meals home to my children each day by taxicab. My beginnings were humble but God gave me favor and placed people in my path who were able to help me. All of my children graduated high school and one graduated college obtaining a Masters Degree in Spanish. As time continued to move on, I joined the Gethsemane Church of God In Christ where I served as a Sunday School teacher for 25 years. I also served on many other auxiliaries. I attended Anointed By God Ministries Theological Seminary, Ebenezer Baptist Church, Inc. in Brooklyn New York where I became an ordained minister. I received a Bachelors Degree and Masters Degree from His Majestys Theological Seminary in New York City. I received a Doctorate of Philosophy Degree in Bible Studies in 2003 with a 4.0 average from Hamilton University in Evanston, Wyoming. My favorite scripture comes from Philippians 4:13  I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.
