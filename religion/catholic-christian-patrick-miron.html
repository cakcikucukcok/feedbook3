      <meta name="description" content="Catechesis 
Taken in the sense of the act of teaching and the knowledge imparted by teaching, this term is synonymous with CATECHESIS and CATECHISM. Didaskalia, didache, in the Vulgate, doctrina, are often used in the New Testament, especially in the Pastoral Epistles. The word katechesis means instruction by word of mouth, especially by questioning and answering. New Advent Catholic Encyclopedia 
We cannot share what we ourselves do not have 
This quote was often shared by the founder of the Marian Catechist Lay Apostolate, Father John A Hardon S, J. one of the Twentieth Centuries foremost Theologians and Teachers of Traditional Catholicism. This profound teaching was the impetus for my years of studying our Catholic Faith. 
I ended my classroom Faith sharing with three years of RCIA; Rites of Christian Initiation  for Adults, and am very much aware of its shortcomings, due primarily, to imposed time restrictions. Personal circumstances took me out of the classroom, but led to a very active internet ministry from home. 
This is a book of Catholic Catechesis, a term meaning instruction by word of mouth, especially in questioning and answering [From the Catholic Encyclopedia]. Through an active participation with the Catholic Answers Forum, [PJM], I was made of aware of an urgent need for supplemental instruction to what RCIA programs were able to impart. So I stared a free on-line course to fill in and add to, what RCIA did not have time to cover. 
We live in very challenging times, as society, and our government seem to have an agenda to destroy Christianity. Abortions, Divorce, and most recently same sex unions that we are told to call marriage, being legalized add to the confusion and the castration of Christianity. This book contains the Lessons from my course: Building Blocks of our Catholic Faith. It is a not a novel, but a series of Lessons introducing, and then proving, most often Biblically, what we Catholics believe and practice, supported with evidence that substantiates and affirms our Catholic Faith, as the One Founded, desired and guided by both Jesus [John 17:18-19] and the Holy Spirit [Mt. 28:18-19]. 
Mt. 28: 19-20 Going therefore, teach YOU all nations; baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded YOU: and behold I am with YOU all days, even to the consummation of the world. This same command applies to me and you. Each of is called to know, practice, share and live the fullness of our Catholic Faith.
