  <title>It&#39;s All About Jesus: It Was About Him. It Is About Him. It Will Always Be About Him. - Asemokhai Yakubu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The truth about Jesus Christ is that He came to the earth to save us from sin. But what else do we know about Christ-and more importantly, what else have we been taught? Was Jesus Christ a man or deity-or both? Was Christ God incarnate, or was he God&#39;s son-a distinct individual? And what is the significance of the body of Christ-the church-and the role of baptism in water for our salvation?   It&#39;s All About Jesus provides clarity and insight into these foundational questions about Christ, the church, and salvation.  Whether it is questions or beliefs about the nature of Christ, the significance of being part of the body of Christ, or how we worship and become new individuals in Christ, believers are encouraged to test all things and hold fast to that which is true. By searching the scriptures and rightly dividing the word of truth, we can grow in our faith and have a clearer and more intimate relationship with the Lord-for everything points to him." />
