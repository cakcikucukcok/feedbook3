  <title>Thanks Be to Bono - Brent Barton, Stewart Stinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="THANKS BE TO BONO is the manifestoed memoir of Brent Barton, the so called controversial U2opian social activist and co-founder of TEMPLE, the organized religion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here, for the first time ever, Brent shares the story behind the rise of TEMPLE. From his early days of downtown street preaching, to the opening of the first wave of TEMPLE mega-plex multi-centers, and all the way through to the international advancement of the extravagantly ambitious U2opian agenda. Here Brent shares his thoughts on Africa, poverty, charity, religion, tolerance, respect, haters, extremists, reality, enlightenment, and the awesomeness of everything associated with the music of the rock&amp;#39;n roll band U2. Here Brent speaks candidly, about his aspirations and of the deep faith that gives him strength and hope. He gives readers clear guidance and helpful tips in the struggle to find balance in times of economic, political and climactic instability. Direct and to the point, Brent shoots from the hip and outlines a new direction for humanity, based on Bono and the music of U2.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are cordially invited to join the celebration of iconoclast, celebrity and activism in the global age of doom and gloom end times religious hysteria! This is not your everyday SENSATIONALIST TELL-ALL memoir of the latest TELEVANGELIST caught in a HOT SEX, DRUGS &amp; ROCK&amp;#39;N ROLL SCANDAL. Cheers." />
