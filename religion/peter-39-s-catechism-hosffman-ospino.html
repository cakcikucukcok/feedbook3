  <title>Peter&#39;s Catechism - Hosffman Ospino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;To be human is to ask questions. Some questions emerge from the context in which we live; others are lasting questions that we cannot escape because they shape our own identity. &lt;I&gt;Peter&#39;s Catechism&lt;/I&gt; is an invitation for Christians to revisit the three questions Jesus asked the apostle Peter in the Scriptures:
&lt;BR&gt;Who do you say that I am?
&lt;BR&gt;Why did you doubt?
&lt;BR&gt;Do you love me?
&lt;P&gt;All three questions are simultaneously particular and lasting: particular because they demand a personal answer from us in the here and now of our existences; lasting because they point to the heart of what it means to be Christian.
&lt;I&gt;Peter&#39;s Catechism&lt;/I&gt; is an excellent resource for adult faith formation and for Christians seeking to rekindle the passion for their faith by entering into conversation with other Christian voices and better engaging the context in which we live today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Dr. Hosffman Ospino, Director of Graduate Programs in Hispanic Ministry, is an Assistant Professor in the School of Theology and Ministry. Dr. Ospino was born in Colombia where he pursued undergraduate studies in Philosophy. He taught philosophy and religion at various academic levels and worked for the National Confederation of Catholic Education of Colombia. He holds an M.A. in Theology with concentration in Church History and a Ph.D. in Theology and Education from Boston College. Dr. Ospino’s research concentrates on the dialogue between theology and culture and the impact of this interchange upon Catholic theological education, catechesis, and ministry. He has lectured nationally and internationally on these areas. He and his wife, Guadalupe, are actively involved in Hispanic Ministry in Boston.
