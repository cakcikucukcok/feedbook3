  <title>A Long Way from Galilee - Kevin Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A  Long Way from Galilee, examines a number of the ways in which the Catholic Church has evolved during the course of its nearly 2,000 year history.
Taking the form of an open-ended letter addressed to Pope Francis, it poses the question of whether the Church may have unduly strayed from its original mandate and the underlying message and example of Jesus upon which it was based. 
The priorities for the Church today are seen as being a willingness to admit to past mistakes, a continuing commitment to expand our understanding of the incarnation of Jesus and a firm resolve  to apply the benefits of this in our pastoral response to the needs of the peoples of our own time." />
