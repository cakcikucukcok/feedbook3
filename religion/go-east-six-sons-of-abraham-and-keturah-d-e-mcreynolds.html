  <title>Go East: Six Sons of Abraham and Keturah - D.E. McReynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Go East: The Romance of Abraham and Keturah, the first book concludes with Abraham sending his six sons born to him by his third wife, Keturah, east. (See Genesis 25:12.) Wanting adventure and to explore (hypothetically) they went west where two brothers had already done in-tern ship in Sidon, one a ship-builder, the other in government administration. These two brothers talked the other four into going back to Sidon with them. Settled in, things went well, why go eastnow? Having put east on hold it took a catastrophe, (the act of the god machine) to bring them to their intended destiny and so it was with Abraham and Keturahs six sons. Though baggage comes along with the mistakes in our lives, sometimes it has a mixed blessing; for stabilizing obligations, corrections, or direction to further the destiny making it more meaningful and appreciated as it happened in the lives of Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak and Shuah,  the sons of Abraham and Keturah. Story-line is based on scripture and history along with adventure, tragedy and romance young men may be involved in." />
