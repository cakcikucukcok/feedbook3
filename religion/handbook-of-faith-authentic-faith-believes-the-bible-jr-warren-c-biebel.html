  <title>Handbook of Faith: Authentic Faith Believes the Bible - Jr. Warren C Biebel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;ABOUT THE BOOK: The original twelve followers of Christ changed the world; indeed, they changed the history of the world. So this author, a pastor with over sixty years&amp;#39; experience, poses and answers this logical question: &amp;quot;If there are so many &amp;#39;Christians&amp;#39; on this planet, why are they so relatively ineffective in serving the One they claim to follow?&amp;quot; Answer: Because, unlike Him, they do not know and trust the Scriptures, implicitly. This little volume will help you do that.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FROM THE BOOK World Leaders no longer risk predictions of what will happen a year, a month, or even a week from now. Too often in the past has history disregarded what man thought and proceeded on its way! Yet the Bible precisely foretold events that would happen hundreds, even thousands, of years prior to the events themselves. How could this be? The only reasonable answer lies in the fact that the Bible is special, as it claims to be - God&amp;#39;s revealed Word! The timetable of history continues to unfold before our very eyes today! Just as surely as human history pivoted on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, so it continues to build toward its final culmination.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;FROM THE&amp;nbsp;AUTHOR &amp;quot;Untold volumes have been written about the Bible, but for most ordinary people it is a book that is really unknown and not very well understood. Faith, belief, spiritual life - all three of these essential parts of real Christianity hinge on the question, &amp;#39;Can we trust that the Bible is really God&amp;#39;s own unique message to mankind?&amp;#39; This is a basic question that every follower of Christ should be able to answer!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
