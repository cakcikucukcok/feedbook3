  <title>The First 10,000 Days - the Silent Years of Jesus - Christopher Halls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The First 10000 days&lt;/b&gt; is a biblical and historical investigation into the &quot;hidden years&quot; of Jesus&#39; life, the 30 years before he began his ministry.  Drawing extensively upon the  Old Testament - the scriptures Jesus knew and loved - our knowledge of first century Judaism and life in Israel at the time, we can begin to put together the pieces of the puzzle - what might life for Jesus have been like? This background material is woven together with New Testament insights about his early life, and the first believers&#39; experiences of the power of the Holy Spirit.  
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the time of the early church, people have been naturally curious about the person of Jesus - his feelings and thoughts as he grew up. The &lt;b&gt;The First 10000 days&lt;/b&gt; speaks to that longing - and also takes care to caution us about what can and cannot be known. Through the incarnation, Jesus was made like us; he knows what it is like to confront difficulties and situations similar to those we face. As Christians, we must guard against the error of docetism, the view that Christ only appeared to be a human being. In the same way that he became aware of his own unique identity, message and mission, so too  can those of us in Christ discover our call and purpose in life. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The First 10000 days&lt;/b&gt; is written as a 30 day devotional guide suitable for both individual and group study. Each day concludes with questions for discussion and reflection.
