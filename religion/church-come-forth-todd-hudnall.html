  <title>Church, Come Forth - Todd Hudnall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Themajority of American churches are stalled or in decline. &lt;em&gt;Church Come Forth &lt;/em&gt;is a strategic model for renewing andrevitalizing plateaued and dying churches into prevailing and growingcongregations. Todd Hudnall combines Biblical insights, church revitalizationresearch and his experience as a turnaround pastor to provide a guidebook for transformation.It is God&#39;s desire to renew His church and most church leaders will find thisplan a Godsend in effectively revitalizing their congregations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steve Pike, Director of the Church Multiplication Network says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three words came to mind when I read &lt;em&gt;Church Come Forth&lt;/em&gt; by Todd Hudnall - Biblical, Practical, Real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biblical - A book about God&#39;s Church would be useless if not filled with wisdom from God&#39;s Book! Hudnall carefully makes the Biblical case for revitalization, unpacking scripture after scripture to lay a firm foundation for why and how a drifting church can once again join God on His mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practical - Todd Hudnall is a seasoned and successful practitioner whose walk aligns with his talk. His counsel is based on the best research and his actual experience of applying that research. As a result, Church Come Forth is loaded with great advice that is tried and true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Real - Todd&#39;s honesty about his personal growing pains is refreshing. His diverse experience in churches small and large make his counsel relatable to every pastor. He writes as a pastor friend writing to a pastor friend. Church Come Forth is a must read for every leader of a plateaued or declining church.&lt;/p&gt;" />
