      <meta name="description" content="Skepticals in religion: watch out! Do not criticize anything about any religion. It is not of good taste; it is considered lack of respect and tact. Better turn apart a political party, science, a football team or anything else; but do not touch religion, even with the petal of a rose. What kind of privilege is that? Who provided it? 
It is not the case for this book. In it, I talk about the evil they all produce. 
Its essence is to forbid thinking. Faith and revelations cannot be doubted a bit, even existing ample evidence of its falsehood. From the hundreds of religions, which is the true one? Coincidentally and curiously, the one that each person happens to follow, by pure chance,  of where he/she was born and which religion parents indoctrinated, nothing else. 
The eminent evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins comments, very appropiately: We are all atheists, but I believe in one god less than you. 
It results interesting to view the debates of the late Christopher Hitchens or Richard Dawkins versus fundamentalists who always bring faith or revelation and thus, never answer the questions asked or the mentioned commentaries. 
Homo sapiens has proved capable of great feats although his design shows carelessness, unless we believe in the evidence of evolution. 
If the damages to children were purely mental, that would be severe enough; but the vast amount of pederasts, such as Marcial Maciel, protected all his life by the pope J. P. II, who has been already canonized! Priests are much like politicians; they cover their backs, and they hardly ever get caught!" />
