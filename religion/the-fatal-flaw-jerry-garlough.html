  <title>The Fatal Flaw - Jerry Garlough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Does it not seem strange that these patrons of truth have no actual base for the truth they espouse?
Should not these champions of reason offer some plausible foundation for the rational thought they employ?
Who can but doubt these adversaries of God who cannot even account for the moral sense by which they denounce Him?
What shall we say of masters of science who would deprive science of the undergirding of truth and reason?
&lt;p&gt;These are not lords of their own domain, as they might suppose. They are squatters on a land belonging to anothermere pretenders, plagiarizers of values not their own. Like the Prodigal Son, they have taken the resources bequeathed by a loving Father and squandered them in futile meanderings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one should take these men as seriously as they take themselves. They are not reaching for the far horizon line. Rather they are trapped in their tiny, cramped valley called physicality and have chosen to ignore every other doorway to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are not men reaching for the stars. They are rather like those who wade through muck and mire, stirring up more as they go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
