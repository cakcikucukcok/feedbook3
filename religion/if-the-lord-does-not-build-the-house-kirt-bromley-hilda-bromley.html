  <title>If the Lord Does Not Build the House … - Kirt Bromley, Hilda Bromley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hilda and Kirt Bromley have set up fifty-three libraries in rural communities in Ghana, West Africa. Responding to a call from the Lord, the Bromleys trusted in Him to provide. They set up a nonprofit organization, collected books, raised funds for shipping, and then traveled to Ghana to meet with local communities to help set up their libraries. The Bromleys view the work as a mission from God to provide opportunities for people in rural areas where textbooks and educational resources are very limited. The Glory of God is the person fully alive is the motto of Books for Africa Library Project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book relates the experiences of this mission from its inception in 1996 to the present time, working with rural communities setting up libraries. There are also stories of Hildas childhood in the British colony of the Gold Coast, her youth as a national runner honored by Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana, her intercultural marriage with Kirt, and their work with AA and Al-Anon in Ghana. Their stories relate the faithfulness of God from the time when the Lord first spoke to Hilda, Go build Me a library in Kukurantumi.&lt;/p&gt;" />
