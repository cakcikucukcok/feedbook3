  <title>Turning Unwanted Situations Around - Carlos H. Lopez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carlos H. Lpez has a life-changing message to those in crisis time in Turning Unwanted Situations Around: The darkest place in your life is not representative of who you are, but of who you will become. He gives one who is desperate the handles for becoming a winner instead of a victim. This is a book for champions.  Dr. Peggy Scarborough, author of Healing through Spiritual Warfare&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My good friend Carlos Lpez has delivered such a timely message in Turning Unwanted Situations Around. Just as he wrote, Your new season may come at the darkest place of your life, I have found this to be true.  Apply these principles and get ready for your turn around. Dr. Joshua Fowler, author of Prophetic Praise  and lead minister of LegacyLife.org Orlando, Fl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are not that many words that can describe the release of a mighty jolt in your whole humanity. Hope is one of those few words. Turning Unwanted Situations Around, written by my good friend Carlos H. Lpez, is truly in synthesis a message of hope. So much needed for these days we are living in.  Those who will read it will be very grateful. Paco Garcia, coach, trainer, and speaker,  of the John Maxwell team and founder of Churches Nueva Vida&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a hope-filled yet sober manual on how to deal with life&#39;s unwanted situations, both practical and inspiring. Its content unlocks not only the power of the word of God to change the life of an individual, but it leaves a deposit that no amount of motivational speaking can accomplish. Turning Unwanted Situations Around will often be reread because of its ability to keep you anchored  and focused no matter what is going on around you. Mugove Chiviya, founder of Inspiration House&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point in our life&#39;s journey, we come to a dead-end street called &quot;Unwanted Situations.&quot; It&#39;s important to know that U-turns on this road aren&#39;t just allowed but expected. It was never God&#39;s intention for us to stay stuck on the side of life&#39;s road.  If you&#39;re stalled, halted, or lost, Turning Unwanted Situations Around can act as a catalyst, fuel, and GPS for your great turnaround.  God will turn all things&quot; around for your good (Romans 8:28)! Tito and Christina Santiago, Paul and Silas Ministries Mentoring coaches&lt;/p&gt;" />
