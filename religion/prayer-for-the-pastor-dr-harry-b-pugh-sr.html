  <title>Prayer for the Pastor - Dr. Harry B. Pugh Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prayer for the Pastor is a fifty-twoweek prayer preparation and preaching presentation devotional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This devotional is designed to encourage every pastor and preacher and even laity everywhere to help stay functionally focused while faced with the pressures of everyday pastoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We need to be ministered and motivated like the membership as we mislay ourselves as castaways in daily ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pastor is a passionate giver who personally doesnt expect anything to be given in return for comforting the bereaved, consoling the burdened, caring for the bruised, or the counseling for the broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pastor is always interested in guiding the lonely and gaining the lost and, with an unselfish attitude, eager to lend a helping hand to a seeking saint or a searching sinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A progressive pastor sometimes walks in his own personal shadow and not in his own physical self simply because his service is for humanity and not to be self-serving to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prayer for the Pastor will serve as a reminder that somebody is praying for him to stay encouraged while he endeavors to engage in exercising his God-given pastoral duties. Prayer for the Pastor will inspire the busy pastor to prepare for preaching and plan for his presentation each and every week. This inspiring devotional can be placed on the pastors study desk for him to grab, glean, and glance at twice a week, especially on Wednesdays during sermon preparation and Sundays in final planning for sermon presentation. I pray that this devotional will bountifully bless your preaching ministry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation will make for a positive presentation that will cause a punctual planning pastor to become a prudent preacher.&lt;/p&gt;" />
