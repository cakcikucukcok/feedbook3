  <title>Conversations on the Porch - Beth Lindsay Templeton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Beth Lindsay Templeton originally created her screened porch as a sanctuary for herself. With its shabby furniture, potted flowers, and tinkling wind chimes, the porch soon became a haven not only for her, but also for other women who craved a sacred refuge to nurture their spirits. It is in this way that powerful conversations with thirty women from the Bible came to Templetons pen; these women gracefully share their stories of faith so others might listen anew in their own worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As different women visit Templeton on her porch, Scriptures come alive in fresh and insightful ways. The conversations she shares with Eve, Huldah, Mary, Lydia, and others not only address issues of women and of the world in general, but also demonstrate that biblical womens stories and insights are as vital and important today as they were when their stories were first told. Conversations center on such common challenges as blame, forgiveness, grief, joy, conflict, sacrifice, trust, hope, courage, wisdom, and above all, living in the power of Gods love and grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conversations on the Porch&lt;/i&gt; shares the refreshing and courageous voices of ancient women as they encourage others to embrace life as a child of God and continue the inspiring conversations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
