  <title>Blasphemous Modernism - Steve Pinkerton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scholars have long described modernism as &quot;heretical&quot; or &quot;iconoclastic&quot; in its assaults on secular traditions of form, genre, and decorum. Yet critics have paid surprisingly little attention to the related category of blasphemy--the rhetoric of religious offense--and to the specific ways this rhetoric operates in, and as, literary modernism. United by a shared commitment to &quot;the word made flesh,&quot; writers such as James Joyce, Mina Loy, Richard Bruce Nugent, and Djuna Barnes made blasphemy a key component of their modernist practice, profaning the very scriptures and sacraments that fueled their art. In doing so they belied T. S. Eliot&#39;s verdict that the forces of secularization had rendered blasphemy obsolete in an increasingly godless century (&quot;a world in which blasphemy is impossible&quot;); their poems and fictions reveal how forcefully religion endured as a cultural force after the Death of God. More, their transgressions spotlight a politics of religion that has seldom engaged the attention of modernist studies. &lt;em&gt;Blasphemy&lt;/em&gt; respects no division of church and state, and neither do the writers who wield it to profane all manner of coercive dogmas--including ecclesiastical as well as more worldly ideologies of race, class, nation, empire, gender, and sexuality. The late-century example of Salman Rushdie&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Satanic Verses&lt;/em&gt; affords, finally, a demonstration of how modernism persists in postwar anglophone literature and of the critical role blasphemy plays in that persistence. &lt;em&gt;Blasphemous Modernism&lt;/em&gt; thus resonates with the broader cultural and ideological concerns that in recent years have enriched the scope of modernist scholarship." />
