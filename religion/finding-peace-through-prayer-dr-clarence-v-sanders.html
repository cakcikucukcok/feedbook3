  <title>Finding Peace Through Prayer - Dr. Clarence V. Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The greatest and most valuable benefit of prayer is that we can draw near to God and learn from him. In this book, it shows us that we need to reserve more time to pray and meditate. When I pray the Lords prayer, I often wonder, how is our Fathers will done in heaven? In this book, we learn no matter where we are or what we are struggling with in life, God is always with us to bless and comfort us. Our Heavenly Father is with us in every difficult time and trial. In this book, we learn how God watches over us, comforts us, and loves us with an everlasting love that never fails. 
This book helps us to hear, to receive, and to respond because it lays us open to unforeseen conclusions. True spiritual transformation can happen when we allow the word of God to address us rather than us trying to control it and its effect on us.
Do not fear, for I am with you, do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand (Isa. 41:10, NIV).
The key to understanding lifes storms is in your private meditation with the Lord. Ask him to give you understanding that you may apply it to your heart.
And this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment (Phil. 1:9). 
Put what you have into his hands, and he will make it valuable.
Prayer is intended for spiritual communication and for requesting things from God. It provides spiritual fellowship and communion. God tells us to ask him for what we need. We are encouraged to make our requests to the father in Jesuss name." />
