      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Each day we are confronted by attacks from the enemySatan. The temptations he sets before us can seem insurmountable at times. We know God will support us in our battles against Satan, but often we do not know how to ask God for help.&lt;/p&gt;

Her writing is aligned with the Word of God and inspired by the Holy Spirit. Walkers debut book is a compilation of writings God has used to bless so many across the world through social media. The author insists that daily, moment-by-moment communion with God helps us overcome the enemys attacks. She touches on the gamut of a believers daily struggles, from dealing with fleshly desires to winning the constant battles between the natural and the spirit realms.&lt;/p&gt;
