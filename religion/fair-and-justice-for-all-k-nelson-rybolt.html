  <title>Fair and Justice for All - K Nelson Rybolt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Just the sound of the words, fair, just and righteous, can prove to be exhilarating as much as they can prove to be confusing. The words sound good, however; in this world, few really believe in them for good reason. For all practical purposes they do not exist.  The words exist, however, the true meaning of the words rarely exist.  Everyone knows that life is not fair. If it were fair there would not be any hungry, much less starving people in the world. 
This world is not a just world. Take our own justice system for example. Its the best we can come up with, so I suppose it is better than nothing. Try convincing that to the families who have loved ones who are innocent yet are incarcerated and even executed, or the victims of the guilty criminals who are set free. These are not infrequent injustices. 
Righteousness is fair and just combined. It has to do with being morally upright and proper. Know anyone like that? Self-righteous and unrighteous people are far more plentiful in this world.
But what if you could imagine a world where fairness, and justice and righteousness were absolute realities?  A world where God, not man or religion, but only God was the One who defined the meaning and measure of fairness, justice and righteousness? Wow! Who wouldnt love that? That is music to our ears. Or rather it should be music to our ears. 
Its hard to imagine a place like that because we have never known a place like that. Yet, there is a place like that that does exist. Some people believe that, and some people dont, and thats okay. All I ask is that you imagine, much like imagining what you would do with all your winnings of a lottery.  Even if you do not win, those moments of imaging, what if, were still fun, and they were real at the time. 
You do not have to believe in this world to have fun imagining it is real. However; be prepared to pay the price if you do decide this world is real. By the way, the price is free." />
