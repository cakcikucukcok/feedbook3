  <title>The Olive Tree Prophecy - Michael Oldham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;John 14:12 Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that
I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my
Father.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you doing the same and even greater works that Jesus did when He was on
the Earth? If not, then there is something missing in your walk with the Lord!
Remember, Jesus is the one who said it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revelation 1:5&amp;6 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that
loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, And hath made us kings
and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and
ever. A-men.
Did you ever wonder why He called us kings and priests unto God?
Revelation 1:7 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and
they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of
him. Even so, A-men.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time is short! Its time for you to take your place as a king and as a priest!
He is coming in the clouds for you and for me!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hebrews 10:12 &amp; 13 But this man, aft er he had off ered one sacrifi ce for sins
for ever, sat down on the right hand of God; From henceforth expecting till his
enemies be made his footstool.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is our job, making His enemies His footstool!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God wants to know, When can I talk to you?&lt;/p&gt;" />
