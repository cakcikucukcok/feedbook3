  <title>The Seed and the Soil: Engaging with the Word of God - Pauline Hoggarth, Joe M. Kapolyo, David W. Smith, Samuel Escobar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Seed and the Soil explores the power of the Bible that brings about God&#39;s transforming and liberating purposes, as well as its power as an often oppressively misused text. Characterised by a wide variety of storytelling, this book is accessible to all that read it.  Electronic Kindle version available from Amazon   What People are saying about the book!  Reading Pauline Hoggarth&#39;s book, one is aware that everything she writes is deeply rooted in her own life of engagement with Scripture and in her wide experience of the Bible&#39;s impact in many different cultural contexts. She is refreshingly open about both the difficulties many people have in engaging with Scripture and the difficulties Scripture itself presents.  Richard Bauckham  Emeritus Professor of New Testament Studies, University of St Andrews  My shelves are full of books about reading the Bible, but Pauline&#39;s new book is outstanding. It is fresh and thoughtful, grounded in personal reality and clearly the fruit of a lifetime of international ministry and friendship, and deep engagement with God&#39;s Word. To those beginning with the Bible, Pauline passes on a wealth of practical insights, and more seasoned readers will be challenged to think more widely and more wisely.  Revd Jenny Petersen  Faith at QMUL  [This] is a more than worthy addition to our bulging library. However, this isn&#39;t a comfortable, intellectually stimulating book about the background to the Bible or some arcane aspect of biblical theology; it is a challenging book about engaging with Scripture . . . If someone were to ask me to recommend books to help them with reading the Bible, I would have no hesitation in suggesting How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth  for help in understanding the text of the Bible and  The Seed and the Soil: Engaging with the Word of God as a help in letting the Bible get under your skin and transform your thinking and actions.  Eddie Arthur  Kouya.net  Speaking with a depth of pastoral sensitivity and cultural insight, this immensely powerful book is grounded with an understanding of the difficulties encountered by many Christians reading the Bible today. The writer&#39;s passion to help others identify and overcome their own challenges includes questions for personal reflection.
