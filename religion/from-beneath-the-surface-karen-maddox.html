  <title>From Beneath the Surface - Karen Maddox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The third chapter of the Holy Bibles book of Ecclesiastes begins To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven . . . (KJV).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is but a mere sample of observations made during various times the author experienced or an effort to capture a state of being or mood and express it through poetryas a christian.  Being one who has made many mistakes (but acknowledging the Lord in all ways so that God can direct her path), From Beneath The Surface begins with an attempt to state the authors understanding of what Christianity is to her.  One of the first few poems admits I Dont Know with regard to where to begin as a christian witness while continuing to seek the Lords purpose for her life.  First View gives a brief glimpse of the authors humble beginnings.  All poems in between the covers (from Fear to Givin Up) attempts to convey thoughts experienced while passing through situations while outside of Gods will (He Felt That Way One Day, Romantic Fool Unleashed, etc.)having gotten off track (Reality Attack)as well as inside of Gods will.  Praying to God with Lord These People Need Help; understanding comes through Love Anyway; then a few philosophical words shared through such poems as Room For All and Grains of Sand.  The author ends with the poem Keep the Faith Alive! which confirms that no matter what lies ahead, with faith in God, the Lord will see you through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heres written proof that even a person with a messed-up life can witness for the Lord when called to do so.  Having experienced hurt, abuse, anguish, pain, heartache, deception, discrimination, rejection, etc. (just like everyone else has), after prayerfully reading the Holy Bible, the author has grown to understand that love (in a godly mannerwith patience, kindness, endurance, steadfastness, etc.) is what the christian is supposed to do as Christs representative.  Regardless of the situation or circumstance, ones belief, faith and love of God should shine through because With God, all things are possible.  Please note that although this compilation was first copyrighted in May 1990, all works were written prior to 1988 and additional material has been added reflective through current situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a goal of putting something positive back into her communitywithout stepping on or using others to do so, Karen utilizes God-given talent and ability to interpret her lifes situation.  (One could say these works touch on existentialisma philosophy centered upon the analysis of ones existence in the worldwith regard to the authors relationship with God at different times in her life.)  Hopefully, this book will be a good representation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; From Beneath  The Surface is a book written from Karens heart, with her hand and in lovebased on her lifes experiences.  As you share, please keep this in mindnothing contained herein is intended to offend any person, place or thing.  Hopefully, inspiration to learn and grow in Gods Word, the Holy Bible, will be ignited, lighting the pathway for Jesus love to come into your heart, guiding you through your lifes journey.  Read your Holy Bible today, then go out and live the Word!  God bless you! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In christian love and devotion,&lt;/p&gt;
