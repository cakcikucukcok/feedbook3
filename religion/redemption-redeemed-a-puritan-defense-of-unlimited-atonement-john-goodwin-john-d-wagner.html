  <title>Redemption Redeemed: A Puritan Defense of Unlimited Atonement - John Goodwin, John D. Wagner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Goodwin (1593-1665), the eminent Puritan Arminian divine, was a man ahead of his time who lived in a turbulent era in which many principals, both theological and governmental, were subjects of controversy.   This new edition of Redemption Redeemed (originally published in 1651), provides a major refutation of the Calvinistic limited atonement doctrine. Goodwin has written an adversarial treatise in which he, step by step, examines the overwhelming scriptural and theological evidence supporting the idea that Christ died for all mankind. He also refutes the opposing arguments of his day and argues that God, through his grace, provides the opportunity for all people to be saved.  The Methodist Quarterly Review noted: &quot;Had Redemption Redeemed been his only publication, it should have been enough in itself to perpetuate his (Goodwin&#39;s) fame. Its great learning, clear reasoning, sound judgment, and admirable spirit, render it worthy of the study of the lovers of this glorious doctrine, and the name of its author is one which all Arminians should delight to honor. A volume so ably written, and going to the bottom of the controversy, could not in that polemical age fail to create a storm.&quot;   In the contemporary period, as Christians enter the 21st Century and Calvinism with its disturbing implications is making a resurgence, Goodwin&#39;s masterful work is a welcome and much needed contribution to those seeking to understand the truths of God&#39;s word." />
