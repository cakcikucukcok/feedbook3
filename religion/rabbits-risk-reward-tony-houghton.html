  <title>Rabbits Risk &amp; Reward - Tony Houghton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Come on a journey through satellite technology, practical farming, lobbying in Brussels and Westminster, medical marketing, campaigning for NGO causes, business development into East Europe and Russia, and volunteer work in Spain. Laugh with me, empathise with my tears, then ponder the challenge of risk and reward.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rabbits Risk &amp; Reward is the latest book from author and businessman Tony Houghton. A memoir with its roots firmly in the world of business, beginning when Tony was just nine years-old, this book shows the reader how seizing opportunities and doing what you think is right may not always work out the way you want it to. Learning from your mistakes, growing as a person and taking something away from these experiences is invaluable - it is these things that make up life&#39;s rewards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tony made his name through hard work, dedication and a will to succeed. In Rabbits, Risk &amp; Reward we learn how he dragged himself out of the dark and how faith and business can be more intrinsically linked than you may initially imagine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
