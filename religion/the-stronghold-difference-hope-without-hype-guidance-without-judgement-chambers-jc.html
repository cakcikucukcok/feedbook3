  <title>The Stronghold Difference: Hope Without Hype, Guidance Without Judgement - Chambers JC</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stronghold was created in 1993 to offer Hope, the hope of real healing for those hurting in a broken world. Healing never takes place alone. Many times it is the result of deliberate, intentional, caring service from committed professionals with years of experience; professional counselors who have already helped hundreds in similar situations. This hope is the foundation of the Stronghold experience.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hope Without Hype&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Healing is never easy. There is no quick fix. It is often times painful. It does not happen overnight. But real, life-changing healing can and does happen regardless of what often may seem like a mountain of overwhelming circumstances. True, we don&amp;rsquo;t know what you&amp;rsquo;re going through. But at Stronghold, you&amp;rsquo;ll never have to face it alone.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guidance Without Judgement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Stronghold was founded on a philosophy of non-judgmental counseling. Before healing can happen, open communication must take place in a safe environment free of judgment. Stronghold provides a &amp;ldquo;judgment-free&amp;rdquo; zone where individuals and families can honestly open up, often for the first time without any fear of repercussions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
