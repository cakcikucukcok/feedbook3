  <title>Speed up Your Success in Times of Crisis - Pastor Noah I. Mushet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intimacy with God remains the age long process for accessing and gaining Gods riches.
In the bible, those who ended as generational rulers among men have been Kingdom slaves in intimate with God.
Intimates of God always end as movers of men. 
You cannot truly be intimate with God and do not impact your generation!
Keep in mind of the patriarch who reminded about God&#39;s covenant of grace with him through a dream. This expression of His love, fortunate care drew Jacob into a closer fellowship with the Heavenly Father. It was at a time when all of Jacob&#39;s plans had been frustrated and he had nothing but a stone for a pillow.
Sometimes it does happen in this life when you feel like; you have no one and nothing else except God Himself! That time is called, time of crisis.
There many touching stories which have been told of how the need of Gods intimacy could be used in the hour of crisis. For instance, William McKinley, assassinated American President, alleged to say on his deathbed, words of being nearer to God. And in 1912, as the Titanic was submerged into the arctic waters of the Atlantic sending at least 1,500 people into eternity, survivors said that the band played, the song of Nearer, My God, to Thee. 
How can a mere mortal benefit from friendship with God? What probable common ground could bring us mutually in intimacy then? 
Intimacy with God is something all should desire. The thought of human becoming friends with God boggle the mind. As small, weak creatures, what could we possibly have in common with the Almighty Creator of the universe? 
I recall Gods servant Pastor Verity M. Kotu of Reach Out For Christ Ministries who suggested that, you cant use God in emergency, for He (God) likes relationships. This is to say that, only when you have a problem, you begin to call on God. Dont be surprised if He doesnt come! Even yourself, you wouldnt like people to think of you only when they need your help! Its like they are just using you. 
God desires that we know Him intimately.	
Chapter five of the book of Genesis lists great men of the past who benefited from intimacy with God.
You can observe that ten men are listed in that chapter, beginning with Adam, continuing through Seth, and ending with Noah.
However, I would like to reveal two personalities whose case was different from the rests. These are Enoch and Noah.
Lets begin with Enoch. The Bible says Enoch was a man who walked with God. In each case the Bible says that each man lived for so many years. You need to underpin the word lived. Every man was said to live from the time he became a father to the time he was buried, with the exception of Enoch and Noah. 
In Genesis 5:18-24 the Bible accounts one of those genealogies that are so tempting to leave out or read through in a hurry. 
In Genesis 5:22 the Bible accounts that after he begot Methuselah, Enoch walked with God three hundred years, and had sons and daughters. 
In Genesis 5:24 the Bible also accounts that Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him. 
Two observations
a. The others who were mentioned in that same chapter lived out their allotted time, but Enoch and Noah walked with God. 
b. Why concerning Enoch and Noah the word Worked was used? Walked with God is a frequent expression in Eastern part of the world, indicating steady, familiar and confidential communion. With no doubt, it describes intimacy and entails a condition of nearness to God. When the Bible says that Enoch and Noah walked with God, it means they both realised God&#39;s presence and enjoyed His communion in an astonishing measure. They grew deeper in intimacy with God, not occasionally, but in a walk that covered three hundred years, and that in a godless atmosphere. 
Abraham was called God&#39;s friend
James 2:23 And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. And he was called the friend of God.
