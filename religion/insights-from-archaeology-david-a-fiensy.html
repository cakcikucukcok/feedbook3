  <title>Insights from Archaeology - David A. Fiensy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Each volume in the Insights series presents discoveries and insights into biblical texts from a particular approach or perspective in current scholarship. Accessible and appealing to today’s students, each Insight volume discusses:  how this method, approach, or strategy was first developed and how its application has changed over time;  what current questions arise from its use; what enduring insights it has produced; and what questions remain for future scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Archaeological exploration of Syria-Palestine and the ancient Near East has revolutionized our understanding of the Bible. In this volume, David A. Fiensy provides a brief survey of a discipline that was once called “biblical archaeology” and describes how the conception of the field has changed; recounts how key discoveries have opened up new understandings of Israel’s own history and religion as well as the ancient Near Eastern and later Greco-Roman environments, and the impact on biblical studies and theology; discusses how archaeological study has shaped the task of biblical interpretation, with illustrative examples; analyzes specific texts through archaeological perspectives; and provides conclusions, challenges, and considerations for the future of archaeology and biblical interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
