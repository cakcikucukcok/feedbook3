  <title>Worthy Woman - Joshua Phillips, Samantha Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My intention for this book is to heal the heart, mind, and soul; to inspire you to live your life freely and abundantly; to help you trust yourself and allow the universe to give you all that you desire; to help you live your purpose and allow love to be abundant in all areas of your life; to help you allow yourself a new starting point that will allow you to redesign, build, and mold the life you have always dreamed of; to give you unconditional love and a supporting tool in life.
My purpose and passion is to allow yourself to see that you can have it all. You are a worthy goddess, and you, your dreams, and your purpose matter. You can have it all when you allow yourself to have it all!
My intention is for you to recognize fear and live your life anyway, to not allow fear to stop you, and to do anything and everything you always have or will want to do. Your purpose is a gift to the universe, and someone is waiting for you to step up and show out! You get to break free from your ego and comfort zone and allow yourself to create. Create magic, create greatness, create success, and love unconditionally!
My purpose is to build a community for women to be a part of, so we can heal the world with love and we all can create our dreams and success. 
My purpose is to extend the #MovementOfLove to you and your family!" />
