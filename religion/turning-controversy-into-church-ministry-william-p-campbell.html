  <title>Turning Controversy into Church Ministry - William P. Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most volatile issues facing the Western Church is also one of the least discussed: homosexuality. Many pastors, church members, and congregations have become tired of the debate surrounding this topic but do not really understand the issues. Pulling away from this controversy doesn’t seem to help; it keeps cropping up.Ninety percent of pastors are aware of members or visitors to their churches who struggle with homosexual tendencies, and the same percentage of churchgoers know a relative or friend who wrestles with this concern. The media, school systems, and nearly every sector of society will challenge Christians to give a reasoned response to the escalating gay agenda. For twenty-five years W. P. Campbell has studied and debated this topic as it relates to Christ’s Church. He has come to the conclusion that it will not go away in our generation, but it can be coaxed to find its proper place in any congregation when it is tackled with a firm but loving grip. Homosexuality in the Church is a guidebook to help Christians and whole congregations do just that. It faces the heart of the controversy with the love and compassion of Christ and turns it into effective ministry.Framed by the most significant biblical passages related to homosexuality and supported by science, psychology and sociology, each of the five parts of the book unfold a unique aspect of God’s person and purpose. As our Creator, he has made us to be whole; as our King he has provided laws and guidelines to help us remain that way; as our Redeemer, his power can save us from sin; as our Guide, his light will guide us out; as our Strength, he will make our ministry effective.As a resource for the church today, this book will:      • Provide readers with a comprehensive overview of the biblical data about homosexuality      • Inform readers about current scientific, psychological, and cultural findings related to same-sex            practice      • Teach readers Christ-like responses to gay rights activists in the Church and help them to know how           to avoid extreme stances about homosexuals and the Church that result in alienating others or in           supporting sexual sin      • Offer guidelines and tools to church leaders for mobilizing a congregation to study this topic and to           engage in ministry to recovering homosexuals" />
