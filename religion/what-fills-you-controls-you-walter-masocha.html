  <title>What Fills You, Controls You - Walter Masocha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are so many things that control the character and behaviour of man. In my view, no-one ever just does things without a controlling force behind. Nothing just happens. There is a force behind everything done or said by man under the sun. That includes creatures too. 
When someone bursts out or loses it, explodes, or suddenly just goes quiet, moody, or commits suicide, what will have happened?  With various practical examples, I apply Biblical passages to analyse the impact of such things as pregnancy, alcohol and drugs, bitterness and anger, jealousy and hatred, love/charity, evil spirits, and the Holy Spirit. I know there are a lot more substances and things that fill and control mankind. I just picked a few to highlight the whole point of the book. One by one, consider the items in the above list again. Read the book, and you will know what you are full of. If you dont like what you are full of, try being born again.
Hey, these things do not care whether someone is rich or poor, educated or uneducated, king/prince(ss) or pauper, male or female, young or old, black or white, or whatever classification you may make. They have no respect for such human forms of classification. I call them levellers. Once you allow them to take up space inside of you, they immediately take over. They are in charge. They take control of the way you think, the way you speak, the way you act, and the way you behave. 
I admit there is fallacy in generalizations, but in this book allow me to generalise. Whether its man or creature, plant, animal or bird, _ I propose a ONE-LINE answer to all these scenarios _ what fills you, controls you!" />
