  <title>Bryson City Seasons - Walt Larimore, MD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Barb and I drove up into the hills just south of the main traffic light and into the parking lot of the Fryemont Inn. We strolled up the front driveway toward the main entrance—a large front porch with several occupied rockers—and stopped to gaze at the nearly endless view across town and up the Deep Creek Valley. The famous Smoky Mountain haze was setting in as the sun retreated behind the distant peaks.”Welcome to Bryson City, a small town tucked away in a fold of North Carolina’s Smoky Mountains. The scenery is breathtaking, the home cooking can’t be beat, the Maroon Devils football team is the pride of the town, and you won’t find better steelhead fishing anywhere. But the best part is the people you’re about to meet in the pages of Bryson City Seasons.In this joyous sequel to his bestselling Bryson City Tales, Dr. Walt Larimore whisks you along on a journey through the seasons of a Bryson City year. On the way, you’ll encounter crusty mountain men, warmhearted townspeople, peppery medical personalities, and the hallmarks of a simpler, more wholesome way of life. Culled from the author’s experiences as a young doctor settling into rural medical practice, these captivating stories paint a collage of small-town faces, events, customs, perspectives, and faith.Lit with love, humor, glowing faith, and the warmth of family and friendship, and tempered with the bright and dark realities of country medicine, Bryson City Seasons is a celebration of this richly textured miracle called life." />
