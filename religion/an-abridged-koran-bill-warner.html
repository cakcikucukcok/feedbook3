  <title>An Abridged Koran - Bill Warner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Now you can read and understand the Koran. A powerful method of ordering, sorting and categorizing the Koran makes it easy to read. When Mohammed&amp;#39;s life is woven back into the Koran, meaning is restored. The Abridged Koran is a powerful epic story. The Koran is very repetitive, for instance, the story of Moses and Pharaoh is told more than thirty times. &lt;em&gt;An Abridged Koran&lt;/em&gt; is abridged by removing the repetition. You learn the full meaning since only repeated material is removed. Islam is a political system, a culture and a religion based upon the Koran, Sira (life of Mohammed) and Hadith (the Traditions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Islamic Trilogy series integrates the three primary sources to give the entire Islamic political doctrine-the treatment of non-Muslims. The Trilogy is authoritative and fact-based. All statements can be confirmed by the use of reference numbers. The knowledge is integrated-all of the primary sources are used to give the complete picture of Islam&amp;#39;s political doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
