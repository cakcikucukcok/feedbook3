  <title>Come, Let Us Reason Together - J.A. Ludwig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is designed to get your group talking as you learn (or re-learn) Biblical truths in a memorable way by utilizing unique, practical lessons with personal and original story illustrations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally from the island of Grand Manan, New Brunswick, J.A. Ludwig now resides in the farming community of Sussex, New Brunswick. As a mother of three and a Bible study/youth/young adult Sunday school leader, Ludwig was never your average small town lady. But is anyone? God took a shy girl that no one noticed and used her passion for Him to share His message in a unique and personal way to touch many lives. From prayer groups to sharing in churches, her answer was always yes when she felt Gods nudge. When a former pastor was asked to say a word about Ludwig and her calling to write this book, this was what he shared:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have known J.A. Ludwig for nearly 25 years. In that time, I have watched her go through bad times and good with the help of Gods great grace. She was a tremendous encouragement to me during my ministry years on Grand Manan. She led an in-home bible study which I was privileged to be a part of. Her work was always original and came from the heart of God. She also led our youth ministry with equal passion, always caring for and concerned for the less fortunate. This book she has written will encourage you and help you find a path through the times of your life that might seem impossible to maneuver through. It has been written with the same passion and grace she has lived her life by and like always, it is her experiencenot a book lesson from someone elses material. So I encourage you to read it and be blessed.&lt;/p&gt;
