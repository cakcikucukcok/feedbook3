  <title>Quantum Christian Realism - Rocco Boni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this fascinating and revelatory new work, Independent Researcher Rocco Boni demonstrates that quantum mechanics is the key to resolving a host of issues associated with the science/faith controversy. No less than an ontological unification of physics, faith, and philosophy, this work reveals how quantum process is the glue that binds God&#39;s Two Books (the Book of Nature and the Book of Scripture) together into a seamless solitary tome; yet without ever once sacrificing the integrity of either science or Scripture.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this new contribution to the theology and science literature and written for the non-specialist, Rocco Boni argues that quantum mechanics supports classical Christianity and resolves some longstanding disparities between science and Christianity. Boni bases his argument
on the ontological claim that while the ordinary world of experience is physical and material, nature at the level of quantum phenomena is nonphysical and immaterial. He then adds to this dualist view of nature a Platonist view of the quantum wave-function. This allows Boni to claim that God, as disembodied, transcendent mind, can interact directly with nature at the immaterial, quantum level. By adopting a Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics which supports an indeterministic view of the quantum world, Boni can also claim that God acts in the world without intervening in, and violating, the laws of nature and natural processes. Readers who have followed the recent discussions of quantum mechanics and divine action will find much to consider in
Bonis provocative book.&lt;/p&gt;
