  <title>Memoirs of Father Germain - Edgar Crespo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An orphan before age five, Germain spends two years living alone on the seashore in seventeenth century France. The fishermen call him &quot;little prophet&quot; since he can always foretell impending storms. One fateful day he strays into a castle of monks-and is not allowed to leave. The monks educate him and he is proved to be an excellent student, but he suffers from their cold and unfeeling ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
As a young man, Germain eventually takes his vows becoming a priest in the Catholic Church. He settles in a poor village with his faithful dog, Sultan, and it is here that he consoles the humble and oppressed-sometimes risking his life for their sake. As his reputation as a virtuous and holy man spreads, even royalty arrive for absolution of their crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
Father Germain teaches love of the Creator and mankind with a belief that even the most hardened heart can be turned toward goodness. He exposes church hypocrisy and is persecuted by his superiors; yet he continues to teach according to his conscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Memoirs of Father Germain&lt;/I&gt; is the touching, true account of this beloved priest&#39;s life relayed to the writer Amalia Domingo Soler of Spain. These stories of intrigue, adventure, human emotion, and morality will provide you with tremendous love, inspiration, and hope." />
