  <title>Helen and Her Sister Haiti - J. Lambert St Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Helen and Her Sister Haiti
A theological reection on the social, historical,
economic, religious, political and national consciousness
with a call to conversion.
Father St. Roses collection of poems captures the rich, vibrant African and European
heritage of the Caribbean culture and landscape. Part I of the collection pays homage
to the beauty of his native St. Lucia in a praise song to Helen. e collection proceeds
to chronicle the development of the nation from the post colonial era to
independence and ends with the protest poetry genre which captures the problems
of developing Caribbean societies in the twenty-rst century. He weaves a ne
tapestry of Greek mythology, and religious imagery infused with Creole folklore and
poignant social commentary. e collection explores timeless themes of West Indian
identity, independence, neocolonialism, politics and modernization. His use of
poetic form with its strong emphasis on repetition, the cadence of the speaking voice
and the powerful protest poetry genre reect the pulsating rhythms of the society
and the poets undeniable passion for his art and the Caribbean community.
