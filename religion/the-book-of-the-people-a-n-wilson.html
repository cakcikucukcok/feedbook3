  <title>The Book Of The People - A.N. Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From renowned historian, biographer and novelist, A.N. Wilson, a deep personal, literary, and historical exploration of the Bible.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The Book of the People,&lt;/em&gt; A. N. Wilson explores how readers and thinkers have approached the Bible, and how it might be read today. Charting his own relationship with the Bible over a lifetime of writing, Wilson argues that it remains relevant even in a largely secular society, as a philosophical work, a work of literature, and a cultural touchstone that the western world has answered to for nearly two thousand years: Martin Luther King was &quot;reading the Bible&quot; when he started the Civil Rights movement, and when Michelangelo painted the fresco cycles in the Sistine Chapel, he was &quot;reading the Bible.&quot; Wilson challenges the way fundamentalists&amp;#8212;whether believers or non-believers&amp;#8212;have misused the Bible, either by neglecting and failing to recognize its cultural significance, or by using it as a weapon against those with whom they disagree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erudite, witty and accessible, The Book of the People seeks to reclaim the Good Book as our seminal work of literature, and a book for the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;" />
