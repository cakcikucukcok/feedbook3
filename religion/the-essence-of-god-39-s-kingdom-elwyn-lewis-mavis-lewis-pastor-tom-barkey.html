  <title>The Essence of God&#39;s Kingdom - Elwyn Lewis, Mavis Lewis, Pastor Tom Barkey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you locked up, locked out, and pressured by the way the governing powers are forcing their will on you? Are you fed up with where the circumstances of life are taking you? Are you feeling the pressure of the cares and uncertain security in the society in which you live? God, our heavenly Father, has a plan to rescue you from this evil world in which you live (Galatians 1:4). There is another kingdom that God has prepared for those who believe in His Son, Jesus Christ. In this kingdom, it is possible to live in peace, above the cares of life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many today are searching for answers to the weary life and present-day pressures. The purpose of Jesus coming was to give every believer a rich and satisfying life (John 10:10). Learning to live in Gods kingdom, while continuing to deal with the corruption of an evil world, is a miracle that comes only by the abundant grace of God, His divine influence being applied to ones spirit, soul, and body. Here, Dr. Lewis seeks to introduce you to Gods fundamental nature, qualities, attributes, and characteristics, and the ability of the believer, under the power of the Holy Spirit, to live by the precepts of His kingdom and overcome the works of darkness.&lt;/p&gt;" />
