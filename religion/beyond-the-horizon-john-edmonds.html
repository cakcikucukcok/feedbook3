  <title>Beyond the Horizon - John Edmonds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author John Edmonds was given something very few were given: insight on the day he died. For the twenty-five minutes when his physical body was without a heartbeat, his spiritual self soared to a great and profound epiphany. On this impossible journey, he was given a glimpse into a greater truth as he learned of his thirty-three previous incarnations on this earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among his past lives, he was an Inuit kinsman, a father, a doctor, a seafarer, an ancient pagan chieftain, and a monk. He was allowed to revisit a former life in which he and Jesus Christ, his dearest soul brother, lived in a town called Bethany. There, they shared in His love and wisdom. At night, as the blazing winter fires burned, they partook of the Divine. John and his sisters clothed Him, bathed Him, and anointed His feet. In return, He saved them in every possible way. Their hearts were torn to learn of His great suffering. He was the One, the Messiah. He was Christ Jesus, and He was Johns dearest friend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are Johns tales of a past life spent in the blessed company of Christ Jesus, his brother, his flesh, and his bloodhis very personal recollection of an extraordinary friendship and love. It chronicles an epic journey from ancient times to the present day, a journey far beyond the realm of the living. This is the story of his fascinating and compelling nonphysical experience and the instruction he received during his time on the other side. His is an astonishing tale of survival, courage, revelation, and inconceivable willpower.&lt;/p&gt;" />
