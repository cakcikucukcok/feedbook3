  <title>Hope Through the Valley - Trevor A. Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hope through the valley is a thirty-day devotional that will encourage, strengthen, and challenge you in the scriptures as you face difficulties in life. You will have the opportunity to do what the scriptures instruct. Anyone can read or hear the word and most will go about their day and forget all about it, but putting the word into action takes strength, faith, hope and purpose. James 1:22-24, But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Understand that this trial is not in your life to ruin you, its here to instruct, challenge and grow you. Romans 5:3-4, And not only that, but we also glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance; and perseverance, character; and character, hope. Now hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In reading Hope through the valley for thirty days my prayer is that you will be impacted by the love and grace of God, reignited in your faith, strengthened by the mighty hand of God, and that you will find a new perspective of your situation as you pray and do the word.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Dont stop at just thirty days of Hope Through the Valley, read it again and relive the challenges.&lt;/p&gt;" />
