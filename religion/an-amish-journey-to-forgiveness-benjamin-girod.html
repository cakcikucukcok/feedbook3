  <title>An Amish Journey to Forgiveness - Benjamin Girod</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;When Ben and Barbara Girod married in 1973, they had no idea their new life together would be one of shared burdens and blessings, lovely dreams and bitter disappointments. Both products of a strict and conservative Amish upbringing, they sought to know Jesus, and they wanted more than the form and tradition of their Amish upbringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;In &lt;em&gt;An Amish Journey to Forgiveness&lt;/em&gt;, author Ben Girod tells his remarkable and unusual story of Amish life, reflecting his painstaking social and spiritual journey over many decades. His responsibilities as a bishop and church leader were manifold as he dealt with the predominant and inherent traditions of the Old Order Amish church. A divine encounter with God brought peace and joy to their lives, but this was soon followed by misunderstanding and rejection by family, church members, and leaders, ultimately ending in excommunication from their respective district.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Devastated, confused, and unable to understand why this was happening, they turned to the Lord in search of meaning and purpose. &lt;em&gt;An Amish Journey to Forgiveness &lt;/em&gt;shares their story as they began to understand that God was allowing such persecution and suffering to draw them closer to Him. It shows how God used Girod to bring about an awareness of the need for healing and reconciliation throughout the body.&lt;/p&gt;" />
