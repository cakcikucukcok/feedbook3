  <title>The Beautiful Necessity: Essays on Architecture - Claude Bragdon, A Joan Saab, Joan Shelley Rubin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A noted American architect of the early twentieth century discusses universal principles behind the harmonious forms and proportions of ancient and modern buildings. Seven essays by Claude Bragdon offer a master class in the architectural union of art, beauty, and science. His observations and analyses encompass a tremendous variety of buildings, from Gothic cathedrals to Giotto&#39;s Campanile to the Taj Mahal, and his examples extend far beyond architecture to the natural symmetry found in the feathers of a peacock&#39;s tail, snowflakes, plants, and the human face.&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Art in all its manifestations is an expression of the cosmic life,&quot; notes the author, &quot;and its symbols constitute a language by means of which this life is published and represented. Art is at all times subject to the &#39;Beautiful Necessity&#39; of proclaiming the &#39;world order&#39;.&quot; Bragdon&#39;s theories are illuminated by his graceful black-and-white line drawings, which portray the essentials of line and proportion as expressed in many well-known buildings and paintings. &lt;BR&gt;" />
