  <title>The Prayer-Given Life - Edward S. Gleason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Not just for church and other public occasions, the Book of Common Prayer is an incredible resource for private and intimate conversations with God. It gives us rich words and phrases with which to pray, words that can slowly change our hearts and minds. Throughout his life as a priest,parent, teacher, head of school,and publisher, Ted Gleason has had thousands of conversations about prayer with children, teenagers, young adults, the middleaged, and the elderly. This book is the fruit of those conversations as well as a love song to the words and cadences of the Book of Common Prayer. Gleason shows us how his long immersion in the prayers of the eucharist and morning prayer have been pathways to a deeper understanding of the presence of God. A gifted storyteller, Gleason has also filled this book with the vivid stories of others who pray and what happens when they do.He urges us to return to the practice of the presence of God every day of our lives, of which this book is a living and vivid example." />
