&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.14in; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; widows: 2; orphans: 2&quot; align=center&gt;&lt;B&gt;Living in the Blessing&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.14in; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; widows: 2; orphans: 2&quot;&gt;Many of us get on our knees and pray each night. We ask that God bless us with this, or that. We repent of our sins and ask forgiveness. I still pray each night and from time to time Ill find myself asking for a blessing. I usually find that God has already answered it because He knew what I needed before I did. I askthat God watch over those that are not as fortunate as I am. I know that people prayed for and are praying for me, so I feel that its only right that I pray for others. I was thinking, which can be dangerous, as I was driving my new car. Gods favor must be with me because I was able tobuy itwithout a down payment, or giving a pint of blood, orlosing an arm or a leg. I realized that I had just received a blessing, or should I say another blessing.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.14in; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; widows: 2; orphans: 2&quot;&gt;I had been asking and praying for a blessing or some kind of sign from God. I had been asking for His favor and until that moment I hadnt realized that I had been &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;LIVING IN THE BLESSING&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt; all along. I was alive and alert, I have family that loves and cares for me and not to put Him last, but I had The Lord. My life is good and I am living in a continuous blessing. What a blessing it was to find myself in a blessing. Some of you know just what I mean, others will find out soon.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P style=&quot;MARGIN-BOTTOM: 0.14in; LINE-HEIGHT: 115%; widows: 2; orphans: 2&quot;&gt;God does not forget or forsake His chosen people. We are those chosen people, you and I. Hallelujah this is why I write and praise the Lord the way I do. &lt;/P&gt;
