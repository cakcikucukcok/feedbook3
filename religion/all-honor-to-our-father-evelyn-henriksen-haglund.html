  <title>All Honor to Our Father - Evelyn Henriksen Haglund</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of a boy born on the Froe Islands three weeks after the death of his father. He was raised by his older sister. His Mother had ten children and couldnt provide for all of them, so she sent some of the older children to family members. At twelve years old the boy was taken to Norway by his sister to work as a crew member on his older brothers fishing boat. He met a young lady that won his heart, then had to endure an eleven-year engagement because of the Great Depression. Through Correspondence courses and apprenticeships he became a Marine Engineer. He emigrated to America and worked on tankers along the East Coast of the United States. This man was my father who endured many heartaches and physical challenges, but never lost faith in his Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
