  <title>The Happy Place - Cheri Beth Roshon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The longer we wait to tie into a new conscious awareness, a universal source, the greater becomes the distance between the warmth of the original God connection, and the coldness of solitary human existence. This is where we lose ourselves, and our children. If only we can show our children this special connection early in life, hopefully the confusion of purpose in adolescence can be avoided. It is to them, our children, that I dedicate this book.
This book is designed to help children understand spiritual values and differences between the personalities of their peers. Tolerance comes through understanding each other.
Cheri, I have read the book and agree that this is the kind of message we need to get to children. If we want a goal, it is happiness! The great problems of the world are the anger and depression of adults who were not nurtured with happiness as children. The Happy Place is one of the most important messages both adults and children can receive
