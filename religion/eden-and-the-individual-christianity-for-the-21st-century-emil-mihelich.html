  <title>Eden and the Individual: Christianity for the 21St Century - Emil Mihelich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even more than we might realize, the Garden of Eden story has supplied the foundation for Western civilization ever since the Roman Emperor Theodosius the Great granted the orthodox version of Christianity imperial support in the fourth century AD. Faced with the scientific and economic challenges of the 21st century, however, it&#39;s time to revisit our traditional understanding of our Christian heritage. &lt;/P&gt;
St. Augustine&#39;s monumental work, &quot;The City of God,&quot; built on his original sin interpretation of the Garden of Eden story, traditionally defined the role of the responsible individual living within the resulting, orthodox structure. But what is the role of such an individual living in an era that has witnessed the waning of the power and influence of that institutional authority-the authority built on Augustine&#39;s persuasive interpretation of the events described in the Garden of Eden story? &lt;/P&gt;
Without throwing the baby out with the bath water, and by paying homage to Augustinian sacrifice and commitment to belief, &lt;I&gt;Eden and the Individual: Christianity for the 21st Century&lt;/I&gt; explores that question. In the process it offers creative conclusions directed toward enhancing the meaning, and value, of individual lives. Given a fresh sense of purpose, every individual can then work toward creating, and preserving, the order and structure that have governed collective Western life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&quot;In this awe-inspiring chronicle, indeed revelation of Christianity Misapplied, Mr. Mihelich, courageously, has given us a pearl to keep for ourselves. And we must.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;
