  <title>Song of Songs - Graeme Watson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From its recorded beginning before Christ, this biblical poem was widely, and in fact exclusively, interpreted both by Jews and Christians as a hymn of God&#39;s passionate love for his chosen people. The Song of Songs is however a mysterious book, and the more modern reading of it as a celebration of human erotic love has largely displaced this older interpretation. Here, the author presents a contemporary mystical reading, with reference to some later Christian poetry, including John Donne, George Herbert and R. S. Thomas. &#39;This imaginatively rich study draws on one of the most complex books of the Bible in order to offer clear, practical guidance for prayer. Graeme Watson also helps us to pray more honestly; the Song of Songs shows us what it is to long for a divine Lover who is experienced most often as an elusive, yet infinitely desirable, Presence.&#39; Professor Ellen F. Davis, Duke University Divinity School ? &#39;For those interested in deepening their relationship with that most mysterious of texts - the Song of Songs - this volume will come as a delight and a joy.&#39; Dr Peter Tyler, St Mary&#39;s University, London ? &#39;Invites us to express Christianity once more in the language of Love.&#39; Adrian Newman, Bishop of Stepney ? &#39;Graeme Watson offers us a treasury of reflection . . .&#39; Jonathan Clark, Bishop of Croydon" />
