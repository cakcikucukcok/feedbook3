  <title>A Real Life Christian Spiritual Journey - Richard Ferguson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;This is a very enlightening book that breaks new ground for those who wish to stretch their spiritual wings based on real life spiritual experiences. This book describes the real life, learning and experiences of those who are born on this earth.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;Part I is &quot;The Journey&quot;.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;It describes the stages of spiritual, psychological, faith and challenges we all go through from childhood to old age. Real life stories from the author&#39;s life are used to illustrate how we grow closer to God. At times this book is gritty showing real pain and anguish of certain people that we all know life can be. Part II is &quot;The Learning&quot;. This part goes way beyond religious doctrine. Here topics such as suffering, real life roadblocks to spirituality, the worlds major religions and how close they really to each other.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;At their core, science and God show an amazing unity between them. We find that the reality that we perceive is not actually there. Again real life current scientific information is used and real life stories are used to bring life to the concepts. Part III is &quot;The Hope&quot;. Here is described the hope of mankind through prayer and the different paths to God. It also tells of real life passing away stories. It centers on the people who survive their loved one&#39;s now in Heaven. It also describes real life mystical events that happen to those who are left behind. The book starts with souls before they are born and completes the human experience cycle with souls back home in Heaven and how they communicate to their loved ones still on earth. Throughout the book the emphasis is on real life stories with all its pain and joys using actual scientific information recently discovered to bring light to the human experience.&lt;/P&gt;" />
