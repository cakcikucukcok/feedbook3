  <title>Where’S the Escape Hatch? Help Me!!! I Think I’M in Hell - T. M. Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bernie is a wild nonconformist who refuses to be politically correct and says whatever pops into his head.  Bernie takes a trip of a lifetime to heaven and hell.  What he finds may surprise you.  &lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Dixie gives seminars regarding the afterlife.  She and Bernie give a blow-by-blow description of what Bernie is experiencing during the seminars.  By the end, many of the attendees will make personal choices that not only affect themselves but those closest to them.  Dixie believes that heaven and hell really do exist and backs up her belief with Scripture during the seminars.  During the seminars, Dixie gives all the true facts and asks the attendees several questions to contemplate on their way home.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe, Bill, Amanda, and Jill attend all three seminars for different reasons.  They all make their choices where they will permanently reside.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rich, Barb, and Julia are all good people, but the choices they made land them where they least expected.&lt;/p&gt;" />
