  <title>Joy Awaits - Dorothy Leeda Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many today search for paths to greater peace and fulfillment in their lives. &lt;i&gt;Joy Awaits &lt;/i&gt;offers readers a myriad of spiritual understandings and approaches to living a life of greater serenity, love, and happiness. This book shares metaphysical perspectives on who we truly are, what our lives are meant to be, and the joy that awaits us all as we awaken to these greater realities from the perspective of our Souls beckoning us on. In addition to these alternative ways of viewing our existence, author Dorothy Leeda Jones, PhD, shares many simple methods to take us into a more joyful experience of daily life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These teachings have come together for Dr. Jones as a result of her interest in pursuing the life of the Soul beginning with a transcendental experience at a period of deep despair and the grace she experienced at that time. She shares the shift in consciousness so needed today to heal our ailing world with true love, sharing, and brotherhood. In this book we are gently and practically guided into our own Soul reality and the joy that we may rest in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are all invited to join her in this adventurous journey into viewing all things, certainly ourselves, from this wondrous and exulted viewpoint of spiritual reality. Dr. Jones asks us to accompany her on this our very own form of walkabout.&lt;/p&gt;" />
