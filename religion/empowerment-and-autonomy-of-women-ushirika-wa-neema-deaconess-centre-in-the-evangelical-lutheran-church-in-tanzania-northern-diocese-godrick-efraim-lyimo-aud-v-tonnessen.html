  <title>Empowerment and Autonomy of Women: Ushirika wa Neema Deaconess Centre in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania, Northern Diocese - Godrick Efraim Lyimo, Aud V. Tonnessen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The emancipation and empowerment of women has been a worldwide phenomenon of concern to many countries and organizations within the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Although Tanzania, as a country, and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) Northern Diocese, as an institution, have embraced the idea of gender equality, most women in Tanzania have yet to experience this in full. This book is, therefore, based upon an understanding of the church as participating in God&#39;s mission, which is rooted in a context of equality and as such stands in a better position to empower women to overcome some of the patriarchal practices that have put them on the margin of attaining full humanity. Therefore, the book examines how Ushirika wa Neema Deaconess Centre contributes to the empowerment of women in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Tanzania (ELCT) Northern Diocese and fosters gender awareness in the church and the entire community. Ushirika wa Neema Deaconess Centre provides women with opportunities, such as the means for independent income, for education, for professional training, and for learning life skills. These opportunities change women&#39;s self-esteem, as well as raise their self-confidence and respect in the church and community." />
