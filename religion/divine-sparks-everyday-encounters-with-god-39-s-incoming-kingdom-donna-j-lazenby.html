  <title>Divine Sparks: Everyday Encounters with God&#39;s Incoming Kingdom - Donna J. Lazenby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;A gem of a book.&#39; &lt;b&gt;Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Many of our everyday encounters in the world are touched by the divine, if we were only aware of it. We may find it impossible to miss God in the great interruptions of human existence, but God often finds a humbler dwelling-place . . . &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Donna Lazenby was in a packed underground carriage when it was taken siege by a group of musicians ripe to start a ceilidh. The &lt;i&gt;eruption&lt;/i&gt; into dull passivity of joy seemed a herald of the Kingdom of God. And so she began to write a series of reflections, some prosaic, others more poetic in tone, that open up ways of seeing light in darkness; love in places of desolation; in-breaking life when all seems tired and old. &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;But the coming of this Kingdom is also revealed in protest, in the world&#39;s cry against a pervasive sense of alienation, while an allegedly &#39;secular&#39; culture steals and presents the claims of the Gospel as its own. And so, &lt;i&gt;Divine Sparks&lt;/i&gt; calls us to be prophets: visionaries able to discern and proclaim God&#39;s incoming Kingdom, as it arrives by day and night.  &lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Praise for the author&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Mystical Theology&lt;/i&gt; (Bloomsbury, 2014):&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;[Written] with elegance and originality&lt;BR&gt;&lt;b&gt;Catherine Pickstock, Professor of Metaphysics and Poetics, University of Cambridge&lt;/b&gt;" />
