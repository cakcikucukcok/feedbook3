  <title>Life Changing Wisdom - Sam Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John 3:16 teaches me how much God values me.  Psalm 23 teaches me that God will take care of me.  Jeremiah 29:11 reminds me that God has a purpose and plan for my life.  Those and so many other passages of scripture have shaped my life.  Of all of scripture however, no other passage has helped me make Godly decisions like Proverbs 3:5-6.  They have become my daily compass for following God.  Life changing wisdom is hard to find these  days.  Conventional wisdom isn&#39;t wisdom at  all - it&#39;s following the crowd.  Water cooler  wisdom make your friends and co-workers  sound smart, but it does little to help you  with your monumental decisions. King Solomon asked God to grant him wisdom and he became the wisest man in the world.  In the Book of Proverbs he compiled thousands of proverbs to help us live our life pleasing to God.  I hope this short study of Proverbs 3 will help you on your faith journey." />
