  <title>Mary&#39;s Bodily Assumption - Matthew Levering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Mary&#39;s Bodily Assumption, Matthew Levering presents a contemporary explanation and defense of the Catholic doctrine of Mary&#39;s bodily Assumption. He asks: How does the Church justify a doctrine that does not have explicit biblical or first-century historical evidence to support it? With the goal of exploring this question more deeply, he divides his discussion into two sections, one historical and the other systematic.      Levering&#39;s historical section aims to retrieve the rich Mariological doctrine of the mid-twentieth century. He introduces the development of Mariology in Catholic Magisterial documents, focusing on Pope Pius XII&#39;s encyclical Munificentissimus Deus of 1950, in which the bodily Assumption of Mary was dogmatically defined, and two later Magisterial documents, Vatican II&#39;s Lumen Gentium and Pope John Paul II&#39;s Redemptoris Mater. Levering addresses the work of the neo-scholastic theologians Joseph Duhr, Aloïs Janssens, and Réginald Garrigou-Lagrange before turning to the great theologians of the nouvelle théologie-Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Louis Bouyer, Joseph Ratzinger-and their emphasis on biblical typology. Using John Henry Newman as a guide, Levering organizes his systematic section by the three pillars of the doctrine on which Mary&#39;s Assumption rests: biblical typology, the Church as authoritative interpreter of divine revelation under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and the fittingness of Mary&#39;s Assumption in relation to the other mysteries of faith.        Levering&#39;s ecumenical contribution is a significant engagement with Protestant biblical scholars and theologians; it is also a reclamation of Mariology as a central topic in Catholic theology." />
