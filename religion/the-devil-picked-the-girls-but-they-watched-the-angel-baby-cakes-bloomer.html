  <title>The Devil Picked the Girls  but They Watched the Angel - Baby Cakes Bloomer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a heartbreaking yet  triumphant story about two girls growing up in the 60s and 70s in the households with street gangster fathers who present them with twisted, dark, and challenging scenarios to overcome. However, it would be one girl through her courage and unyielding faith as instilled in her from the words of her dying great grandmother who decided she would resist all the negative forces coming up against her by attaining education and standing firmly on her spiritual legacy as a means to fight the negative effects of male dominance coupled with mental illness, drugs, and sex all the while resisting but still curious about the street life. This personal journey evokes a rollercoaster of emotions from sadness to happiness and demonstrates elements of suffering and struggle along with love, friendships, resistance, patience, and perseverance. Courageously sacrificing her own safety, Kathleen, returns to her dangerous and wicked environment to help her mother and good friend escape the obstacles hindering them from living decent and happy lives. It gives a riveting account of survival when you find yourself in circumstances beyond your control. Kathleen beginning at the young age of 10 years old decided to fight, not die, and live realizing then there was nothing else to depend on except God." />
