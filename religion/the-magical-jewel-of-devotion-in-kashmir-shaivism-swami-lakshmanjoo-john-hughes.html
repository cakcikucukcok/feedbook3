  <title>The Magical Jewel of Devotion in Kashmir Shaivism - Swami Lakshmanjoo, John Hughes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Even if you are already drowned in the cycle of the ocean of repeated births and deaths, when you once find attachment (love) and devotion for Lord Shiva, then you have found that Cintamani jewel.&amp;rdquo; ~Swami Lakshmanjoo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;The Magical Jewel of Devotion in Kashmir Shaivism - Stava Cintamani&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;as revealed by Swami Lakshmanjoo,&amp;nbsp;is a sublime and unique hymn addressed to &amp;lsquo;Lord Shiva&amp;rsquo;, whom the author, Bhatta Narayana, clearly holds as the Supreme Reality. Though these hymns are both practical and deeply philosophical, the constant theme that runs like a thread through the one hundred and twenty verses&amp;nbsp;is that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;devotion&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;towards Lord Shiva is everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That Bhatta Narayana composed his hymn with the intention of introducing his audience to the richness of the path of non-dual Kashmir Shaivism is clearly visible in his unique interpretation of the ancient and highly revered Gayatri mantra:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t care to possess that effulgent light (tat savitur varenyam) of the three worlds (bhuh, bhuvah&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;svah), and I don&amp;rsquo;t need my intellect elevated to the state of universal understanding (dhiyo yo nah pracodayat); I want only for that effulgent light to direct me on the path of Shaivism &amp;ndash; that is all I long for &amp;ndash; and that is the only favor I ask of Gayatri.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book Swami Lakshmanjoo shares with us the secrets gleaned from the ancient masters of the oral tradition of Kashmir Shaivism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
