  <title>Joshua Called to Lead - Dr. Boyd O. Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Joshua Called to Lead: Pursuing Exemplary Leadership&lt;/I&gt; demonstrates how leaders faithful in their missions to follow God rest their leadership upon obedience to God and trust in His promises. By exploring how secular leadership goes awry in basing itself upon limited human knowledge, Boyd O. Gray, a retired minister with thirty years of experience, shows how such leadership ends in failure rather than in Gods peace and prosperity. Taken together, these guides to the pitfalls and possibilities a leader faces reveal how to imitate Joshuas example by pursuing exemplary and faithful paths of leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arranged as a passage-by-passage reflection on the biblical text, &lt;I&gt;Joshua Called to Lead&lt;/I&gt; draws from several translations, choosing in each instance the one illuminating the leadership-oriented message the passage contains. The commentary also connects the Old Testament account and the Christian life: Joshua may have doubted Gods intent at first, but He still went before Him in humility and repentance. In repentance, God gave him the answer he was looking for. The child of Gods can always find the will and purpose of God through repentance and prayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Joshua Called to Lead: Pursuing Exemplary Leadership&lt;/I&gt; speaks to all who desire to learn about the biblical figure of Joshua, who seek deeper understandings of his faithful leadership, or who crave a model for shaping ones own efforts to lead. If you belong to any of those groups, then &lt;I&gt;Joshua Called&lt;/I&gt; to Lead will guide your own journey to appreciate and to pursue exemplary and faithful leadership.&lt;/p&gt;" />
