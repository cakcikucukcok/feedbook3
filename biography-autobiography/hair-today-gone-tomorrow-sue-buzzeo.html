Vowing never to marry again, she met Mark during a residential training course. Despite all her reservations and her determination not to fall in love, she realised that she had found a man who loved her like no other. On the day of their house move into their new home and new life together, shefound a lump in her right breast.

It tells of her thoughts, feelings and emotions as she faced up to the prospect of losing her breast and dealing with the tough treatments that followed. Sue, like many diagnosed with cancer, did not know what to expect and so she has written this book with the hope that is will provide encouragement and inspiration for those in a similar situation. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
