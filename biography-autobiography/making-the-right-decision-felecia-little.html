  <title>Making the Right Decision - Felecia Little</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about my personalized road trip to aid in the campaign of President Barack Obama Jr. to become the forty-fourth president of the United States.  It is a book that explain how it was my childhood wish to live in the white house. Because of the color of my skin my mother told me it could not be done. My reply to her was that someday a person of color will occupy the white house along with his family. My wish came true on Nov.4, 2008 when Senator Barack Obama became the 44th president of the United States. I explains how I began my journey from my comfortable Caribbean environment to contribute to this historical day. I talk about how I used a bus pass to travel the country and living a very frugal lifestyle to encourage people to vote for President Obama. I mention in the book some of the people I met, and I share their stories with my readers. I talk about even though people were concerned about the two wars and a downhill economy, their relationships with their partners was also very important. I talk about how I was asked numerous times how my husband allowed me to be on the road for so many months by myself. I talk about how I entered a female homeless shelter. I point out that I worked two jobs to get back on the campaign trail. I talk about how my husbands love and support encouraged me as I travelled on my journey by myself. I also talk about what made our relationship so strong after taking this 18 month road trip." />
