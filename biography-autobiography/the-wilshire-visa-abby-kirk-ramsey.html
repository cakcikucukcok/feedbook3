  <title>The Wilshire Visa - Abby Kirk Ramsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What constitutes a community?
Greater Los Angeles has been known for decades for its iconic freeway gridlock, two-car families and high-rise buildings atop massive parking structures.
In 1990 the author, a single mother with a daughter at college on the East Coast, was boarding a transit bus at 4:35 AM in downtown L.A., five mornings a week. The joy of living had become only a distant memory in this darkest winter of her life, but she was always at the bus stop on time, determinedly headed for work in Santa Monica: Head down, always carrying a book (what, after all, could you do but read, sleep, or maybe knit for that hour on the bus?)
Within a month or two - and almost against her will - she had discovered a living, breathing community of people on the No. 20 westbound. Her life was changed that season - by her fellow passengers, and by a uniquely gifted driver with an understanding of The City and its people." />
