  <title>Just One Simair Story - Rich Schaffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rich Schaffer served the Lord for 20 years as a missionary pilot with the Sudan Interior Mission in Nigeria, West Africa. Harold Fuller wrote .. Great stuff, Rich. You have a very interesting writing style .. reconstructing conversation, describing vividly, building suspense. Were enjoying the chapters as you send them. I knew you were an accomplished pilot, but had no idea of your writing skills. Glad you are now using them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flying with Rich at the controls was always okay. Although my heart at times pounded as the tiny Cessna faced a threatening tropical storm. I knew this matter-of fact guy of few words had the courage and professional experience to find a hole through or around the thunderheads and bring us out safely on the other side. And Rich always acknowledged that the Lord had given him the qualities that made him a top-rate pilot for Africas uncertain weather and questionable landing strips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  In this story about SIMAIR, Rich takes the reader through many an adventure that showed Gods hand to be on the Mission aircraft and its occupants. With vivid description and homey dialogue , Rich weaves an honest account how God took a little boy from a tarpaper shack in Americas Midwest and made him part of a team who brought the Gospel to the neglected interior of West Africa .. fullfilling his boyhood dream of flying. Down to earth humor, growing pains, high adventure, finding God in dry season and rainy-season tempest .. Rich holds the readers attention from pagecone to the storys end.&lt;/p&gt;
