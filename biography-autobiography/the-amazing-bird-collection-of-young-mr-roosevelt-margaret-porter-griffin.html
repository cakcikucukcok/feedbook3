  <title>The Amazing Bird Collection of Young Mr. Roosevelt - Margaret Porter Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A historian once said of Theodore Roosevelts education
that it had been the best kind, for he was both teacher and
pupil. By the time he went to Harvard, he had preserved
several hundred birds for a collection. How did he become
an accomplished scientist at a young age? He:
was curious, always wanting to know more and find out
the why of things.
learned from playing: imitating animal sounds and habits
and making up his own games.
looked up to mentors, including his father, uncles, and a
companion of Audubons.
read deeply from fiction and nonfiction.
continually made observations, filling diaries and
notebooks with charts and essays.
sketched nature in letters and notebooks.
took risks, ready to pay the piper if he thought something
was worthwhile.
customized learning to his own needs, starting a natural
history museum at home when he was eight and inventing a
code for bird songs.
studied the real thing, with being there experiences in
the outdoors.
shared information with family and friends.
Look for more in this book, and get to know a unique boy
who still inspires others today." />
