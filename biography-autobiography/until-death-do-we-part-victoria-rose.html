  <title>Until Death Do We Part - Victoria Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author was born and raised in a small West Virginia town among the hills and mountains she so loves. Her family tree, however, has very deeply planted roots in the Carolinas of the South.
Her Great Grandmother lived to be over ninety years old, but never left the small city where she raised her family in Northern North Carolina.
Her Grandmother moved to Western West Virginia in the roaring 20s and settled down in a small town near the Kentucky border, at the point where the Big Sandy River flows into the Great Ohio River. The author was later born in the same area and remains there to this day. 
The author has been afforded the opportunity of raising three wonderful children, who all have left the area, other than one son, who remains.
The two female children have provided her with three marvelous grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. The authors eldest granddaughter and great granddaughter has returned and established their abode in the same geographical area. 
The author lives with her husband of forty-five years, and looks forward to completing their earthly lifetime together." />
