    Giving Thanks
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I wanted to take the time and thank all of you who stuck by me during my horrendous struggle. There have been so many people that I have come in contact
    with over the years, and I wanted to say Im sorry for anything I might have done that offended or hurt you. Shortly after my husband and I met, he made a
    comment to me that I didnt give much merit to until now: Dont complain about the things that you have the power to change. And I now follow that advice
    to my new everyday life! I also remember a wise person once told me, Its not what you do while youre here on earth but the legacy that you leave
    behind! This is the beginning of my legacy!
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Thank you to all my family and friends for hanging in there with me. I give my utmost apologies for anything I might have ever done to hurt you. I love you
    all very much! I am grateful to God every day for you and all that you have done for me!
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Thank you to my church family for trying to keep in touch with me, letting me know you were all still there for me! I appreciate it more than youll ever
    know! I think it would be safe to say that all your prayers for me have been answered!
    &lt;br/&gt;
    I wanted to say thank you to Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, and Jeff Dunham for giving me many laughs during my long struggle! Im sure you might think its
    silly, but those laughs helped me in more ways than you could ever imagine! I also want to say thank you to Marshall Mathers. You showed me to be proud of
    where I came from, and even though we may have been involved with some nightmarish ordeals while growing up, we are still important people in Gods eyes! I
    want to give a special thank-you to Pink for helping me realize that surviving our struggles doesnt mean that we are damaged goods, but we are pretty
    freakin incredible! For those of you who like to make mean, nasty, hurtful comments about people, please think twice before saying anything else about any
    one!
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Thank you, God, for never giving up on me even when I felt you had every right to! I have chosen you to be the first priority in my life! I love you with
    all my heart and soul for creating your son and sending him to die for me! That type of sacrifice to save the people you love is truly on a level that is
    completely mind-blowing and can never be fully appreciated as long as there are people out there who continue to deny you! People say fairy tales dont
    exist, and I guess I would have to agree but not because I dont think they exist but because what you did to save all of us, all your sinful people whom
    you created, far outweigh the happy endings in any old fairy tale! There were times when both my parents had really hurt me and let me down, but we all
    have our imperfections, and with that being said, I have completely forgiven them for everything! But you, my heavenly Father, have never let me down, and
    I know that you never will! Thank you for taking away my lifelong pain and anger, turning it into knowledge, courage, and strength! I only hope to make you
    proud and truly be that person you had created me to be!
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Thank you to everyone for reading this book. God had so many opportunities to take me out of this world, but I am praying you all realize that having the
    chance to read this book is exactly why he didnt!
