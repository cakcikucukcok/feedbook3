  <title>Robert Bryan - Robert Bryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since his boyhood days watching test pilots roar through the sky over his Long Island, NY, home, Robert Bryan was fascinated with flight. Add to that his love of a good story and his vocation as an Episcopal priest and you have the three great themes of his life. &lt;br /&gt;After his graduation from Yale Divinity School&amp;mdash;where he met Marshall Dodge and the two created the immensely popular storytelling duo &amp;ldquo;Bert and I&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Bryan became a minister to the remote settlements of Quebec&amp;rsquo;s North Shore. In the mid-20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; century, the best way to reach parishioners was by bush plane, so Robert rose to the task. He went on to spend 50 years as a bush pilot and minister, logging more than 12,000 hours at the controls. This endearing memoir traces his life and adventures during that time and weaves in his experiences performing and recording with Dodge.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
