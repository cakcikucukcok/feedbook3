  <title>The Last Two Years - Arthur Marsicano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As the writer&#39;s wife fights advanced ovarian cancer, pancreatitis and possible liver cancer, they turn to friends, family and their very different religious beliefs for strength, support and insight.&lt;/p&gt;
During a dramatic two-year period their lives intersect with others experiencing tragedy, and they draw strength, inspiration and even joy from all of them-every single one of them. Jean Marsicano&#39;s life was threatened by ovarian cancer-known to many as the silent killer-and she was joined by her husband, her &quot;Rock,&quot; as they focused on fighting the evil which had invaded her body. They counted their blessings, asked if their lives had meaning, and in the face of great adversity, they enjoyed life.&lt;/p&gt;
Jean survived &lt;I&gt;The Last Two Years&lt;/I&gt; thanks to three physicians-&quot;Pal&quot; and &quot;Mitch&quot; who supplied support and direction when they needed it most, and Dr. Goodman, a brilliant young physician who delivered Jean&#39;s medical care with skill, wisdom and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;
As &lt;I&gt;The Last Two Years&lt;/I&gt; end, they find hope in the face of continuing uncertainty and joy in friends, family and the beaches of South Carolina. And they realize &quot;God was There,&quot; and will always be there with them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
