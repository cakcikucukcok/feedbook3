  <title>The Downwind Walk - Steve Kanarian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;About the Book&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Downwind Walk lets you experience the tragic events following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11, 2001 through the eyes of an Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) paramedic who went into harms way to rescue the victims, which rapidly included many of his brothers and sisters of the New York Fire Department (NYFD) and Emergency Medical Services (EMS).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The author was a member of the EMS FDNY in the Bronx who was deployed with the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) USAR team at Ground Zero. He went downwind with the USAR team after they set up operations and donned the proper protective clothing and breathing protection. Their mission was to take a first hand look at that mass casualty incident (MCI), assess the damage and losses, and make an estimation of resources needed to mitigate the incident. The reader is invited to take the downwind walk with Steve as he recounts the events, sights, smells and vivid memories of that unforgettable September .. from eye level at Ground Zero, in his dusty boots.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this book, you will read stories about EMTs and paramedics who were at Ground Zero with the author, including some who were wounded or traumatized and others who made the ultimate sacrifice. You will also learn about NYFD EMS personnel who made a significant contribution to patient care and public service by responding to numerous 9-1-1 calls or assisting fallen coworkers that week despite extremely stressful working conditions. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;No doubt you have heard the popular stories that tell of heroism on airline flights, in the Twin Towers and at the Pentagon. It is also important for future generations of Americans to know about the sacrifice and dedication of NYFD EMS first responders. Now is the time to share their stories as the 10th Anniversary of 9/11 looms on the horizon as ominously as the smoke and dust filled the atmosphere after the collapse of the Twin Towers. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Steve wants future EMTs and paramedics to know about the individual acts of caring and dedication of the EMS first responders at Ground Zero. He also would like to share with them stories of how EMS dealt with this horrendous incident and lessons learned from the catastrophic consequences of that MCI so they may learn from their experience.&lt;/P&gt;" />
