Every day after school your father takes you to a sprawling castle filled with exotic animals, bowls of candy, and half-naked women catering to your every need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have your own room. You have new friends. You have an uncle Hef who&#39;s always there for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the world of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;Playground&lt;/em&gt;, the true story of a young girl who grew up inside the Playboy Mansion. By the time she was fourteen, she&#39;d done countless drugs, had a secret affair with Hef&#39;s girlfriend, and was already losing her grip on reality. Schoolwork, family, and &quot;ordinary people&quot; had no meaning behind the iron gates of the Mansion, where celebrities frolicked, pool parties abounded, and her own father&amp;#8212;Hugh Hefner&#39;s personal physician and best friend, the man nicknamed &quot;Dr. Feel Good&quot;&amp;#8212;typically held court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day was a party, every night was an adventure, and through it all was a young girl falling faster and faster down the rabbit hole&amp;#8212;trying desperately hard not to get lost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
