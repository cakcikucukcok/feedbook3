  <title>Extremely Pale Rosé - Jamie Ivey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a sunny day in the South of France, over a typically langorous French lunch, Jamie Ivey, his wife, Tanya, and their friend, Peter, discover the distinct pleasures of drinking a bottle of cool, pale rosé in the Mediterranean sun. Far from the plonk he&#39;s used to in England, Jamie is entranced by a blushing wine that is seen as no more than an aperitif by the French, but one that is rising in popularity all over the world. Owing to a translation mishap, Jamie finds himself challenged to the task of finding the palest bottle of rosé in France. Rising to the occasion, Jamie sets off with Tanya and Peter in tow through the vineyards of France to find the elusive bottle. They visit the main rosé producing areas, trawl through every tiny bar and sample the local bistros. Peter noses out the local specialties, as well as the best purveyors for threateningly odoriferous cheeses. &lt;i&gt;&quot;Extremely Pale Rosé&quot; &lt;/i&gt;is food and travel writing in the best tradition as Jamie and his fellow travelers eat, sip, and taste with the colorful vintners, chefs, bakers and townspeople who live in and among the vineyards. Readers will be delighted. It&#39;s the perfect book to read on a summer day while sipping a glass of icy Bandol, nibbling on a bit of baguette and dreaming of the south of France.&lt;/p&gt;" />
