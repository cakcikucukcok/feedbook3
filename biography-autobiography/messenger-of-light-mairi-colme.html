  <title>Messenger of Light - Mairi Colme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;About the life of Jesus of Nazareth. He is seen here through the eyes of the people he met, as recorded in the gospel stories, who related to him and witnessed his human presence.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The book is &quot;Christ-centered,&quot; depicting him as the central character ofthe story which leads from the joy of his birth through his healing and teaching ministry to his sorrowful death and triumphant resurrection. It is divided into eight parts, as an historical account derived from the material in all four gospels. Firmly rooted in these texts, it adds poetic imagination to the detail, providing vividness and authenticity, in order to bring Jesus alive as a living person who can be encountered.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As he moves among the common people and the Jewish elite alike, in the historical setting of first-century Galilee and Judea, he entices and challenges, he heals and liberates. We thus see his character and divine nature revealed, and the unique impact he made on the people around him at the time. These historical experiences of meeting Jesus can be just as relevant for people today, as he is for all places and all time.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Ideal for young people and new Christians, who seek to find out what Jesus may mean for them.&lt;/P&gt;" />
