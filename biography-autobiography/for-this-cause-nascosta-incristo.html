  <title>For This Cause - Nascosta InCristo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;To be a drug addict is to be a slave to a beast that constantly screams to be fed.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Its a feeling that Nascosta InCristo discovered as a teenager in Australia, where she grew up feeling ignored by her parents.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;She began skipping school and found new friends that made her feel loved. It was with them that she took her first toke of marijuana, rolling around on the grass and laughing uncontrollably after smoking it.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this candid memoir, she recalls how that first joint led her to a figurative and literal prison. More importantly, she reveals how she escaped to a brand new life full of possibilities.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Whether youre a parent, teacher or counselor seeking to help a troubled loved one, a former drug addict or someone seeking to rediscover the freedom youve lost, youll be inspired to overcome obstacles with &lt;i&gt;For This Cause&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;.
&lt;P&gt;A gripping read! The author takes us on a journey through her years as a drug addict  and her emergence into wholeness and new life. Her story will reach into the hearts of many and hopefully inspire others to pursue the path to freedom.&lt;/P&gt;
