  <title>Wayde van Niekerk - Carlos Amato</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wayde was quick off the mark from the day he was born: two months premature and weighing no more than a litre of milk, his life was in danger. But little Wayde survived and grew to become the world’s leading sprinter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wayde van Niekerk&lt;/i&gt; tells the extraordinary tale of a boy who defied the odds, time and again. He was small and skinny, but he tackled big rivals on the rugby field. And just when he was about to become a world sprinting star, Wayde suffered a series of terrible hamstring injuries. At one point, he was so depressed he almost gave up athletics for good. But his faith, courage and dedication – along with his magnificent talent – kept him going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We learn that Wayde was deeply motivated by his mother Odessa’s brilliance as a sprinter before his birth – back in the apartheid era when black athletes were unable to shine on the biggest stage. Wayde’s sense of honour also shines through in the story: how he stands up for the weak against bullies, and gives generously to those less fortunate than himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the climax of the book, Wayde flies his family to the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where his greatest moment awaits him.&lt;/p&gt;" />
