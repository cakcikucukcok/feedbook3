  <title>An Order of Chaos - The Leopard Of Shadow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am The Leopard of the Shadows. I am the essence you feel when you read the lines I have written. I stalk the souls of those who read my stories, thoughts, and poems. Enchanting them with the subliminal messages that hide amidst the lines. My spells swirl amid the words, entering through your eyes to fall upon your mind with the sorcery of a lost soul. You can not help feeling the energy and aura when you hear the howl of one who is nocturnal. Beware Reader of the wisdoms contained in that which I have written. For Wisdom is the theif who robs us of the naivette of innocence! 
There is truth to be found in even the greatest fictions. How much more in tales based upon the truth? There is more to the stories upon these pages than what I can write in them and many more written peices of these records that I have purposely left out for the next Outlaw Manuscript. I am a Pagan, a vessel spirits and creatures of other realms and dimensions use as a voice. They are calling you! It is not your adoration, nor you weath or worship that they seek. 
As you read through these memoires of confusion you will feel them tug at the energy inside of you, drawing heat from the flame which is found at the core of each temple we call our bodies. Do not be decieved by who I am or what I have done, these things were lessons meant to teach me what I need to know about the enemies of my mistress, the Night.
