  <title>You Just Had to Be There - Michael Francis Trochan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
Bobs loyalty to the Troops was at the highest level.  He went where the Troops were and if there was a war going on, Bob became more determined to see us.
&lt;p&gt;
Bob was like one of us.  He was breathing the same air that we were breathing and that mattered.
&lt;p&gt;
Bob made the Troops the stars, the audience was the Show.
&lt;p&gt;
Bobs U.S.O. Christmas Shows with the Troops had meaning and is now History.
&lt;p&gt;
The spirit and the memories of it all should live forever!
&lt;p&gt;
I wrote about my particular set of circumstances: leading up to the Show, at the Show and then after the Show.
&lt;p&gt;
THIS BOOK IS DEDICATED TO ALL THE TROOPS!  
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE.
&lt;p&gt;
I have been watching The Bob Hope United Service Organizations (U.S.O.) Christmas Shows with the Troops with my family, since I was about 4 years old.  I enjoyed watching the Troops in the audience laughing, having a good time, getting together.
&lt;p&gt;
The Troops were my Heroes, my Stars.  I thought that maybe when I grew up; that one day, I would be in the audience of one of Bobs Christmas Shows.
&lt;p&gt;
It was inspirational for me to see and hear the people singing Silent Night together at the end of the Show.
&lt;p&gt;
The Memories Are Priceless!
&lt;p&gt;
Like we still talk about Remember The Alamo, I think we should say,
Remember The Bob Hope Christmas Show, because it was important.  
It brought us together!
&lt;p&gt;
I thank my Lord, Jesus Christ, for helping me get to 
The Bob Hope Christmas Show and in writing this book.
&lt;p&gt;
At The Bob Hope Christmas Show: the sights, the sounds, living through the moment of it all was the best.
&lt;p&gt;
Bob, Thanks For The Memories!
