  <title>Unintended Consequences - Nathan E. Martin M.D. Dnb Daba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book includes the things that happened to me over ninety years of my life. It begins with my childhood, progressing through all levels of school, military service, medical career, and retirement.
Some of it is sad. Some is hilarious, and some will make you very happy. You will read about the smart things I did wellsome that were really stupid and some that I regret.
You will learn about the workings of a feed mill run by a waterwheel. The artificial insemination of cattle may be something amazing to you.
Life in Korea in the army was depressing from start to finish. I consider it the lowest point of my life. It was endless, pointless, and a constant source of irritation to all concerned. It was the first war we fought without the goal of winning. We have not won a war since.
The practice of medicine was fascinating, watching new drugs being made, new equipment introduced, and new techniques developed constantly. It was a great time of innovation, and I always looked forward to the next advancement." />
