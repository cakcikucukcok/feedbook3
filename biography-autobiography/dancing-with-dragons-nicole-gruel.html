  <title>Dancing with Dragons - Nicole Gruel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dragons are ancient mystical creatures that come bearing gifts and messages from the deepest and darkest corners of the psyche. For those who dare to dance with them, secrets from the personal and collective unconscious are revealed in the most unexpected and creative of ways. The dragons are wise and experienced guides in matters of the shadow and journeying with them can awaken the soul to greater communion with Spirit and wholeness in all dimensions of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dancing with Dragons, Nicole Gruel shares an intimate and personal account of meeting the dragons whilst experiencing total body meltdown. After years of travelling paths of love and light, she recalls how the dragons came to bring balance to what had become a lop-sided way of being. By honestly facing that which remained hidden and through integrating all that surfaced, she describes how she came into greater alignment with her most authentic Self. As she travels through the seven chakrasthe portals of psychological, somatic and spiritual knowingshe shares the complex struggles ego encounters as the being becomes whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is an invitation into the fascinating and trepidatious world of the dragons that reside within each of us. It speaks to the most primal and archetypal patterns of the soul journey, and sheds light on the many obstacles the ego faces in this earthly life. When we accept the invitation to dance, we are moved through the alchemical fires and who knowswe may even stumble across the gold that awaits.&lt;/p&gt;" />
