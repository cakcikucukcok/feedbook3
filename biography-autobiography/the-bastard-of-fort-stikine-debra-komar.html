  <title>The Bastard of Fort Stikine - Debra Komar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner, Canadian Authors Award for Canadian History, Jeanne Clarke Memorial Local History Award, and Prince Edward Island Book Award for Non-Fiction&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it possible to reach back in time and solve an unsolved murder, more than 170 years after it was committed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just after midnight on April 21, 1842, John McLoughlin, Jr. &amp;#8212;  the chief trader for the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company at Fort Stikine, in the northwest corner of the territory that would later become British Columbia &amp;#8212; was shot to death by his own men. They claimed it was an act of self-defence, their only means of stopping the violent rampage of their drunk and abusive leader. Sir George Simpson, the HBC&#39;s Overseas Governor, took the men of Stikine at their word, and the Company closed the book on the matter. The case never saw the inside of a courtroom, and no one was ever charged or punished for the crime. To this day, the killing remains the Honourable Company&#39;s dirtiest unaired laundry and one of the darkest pages in the annals of our nation&#39;s history. Now, exhaustive archival research and modern forensic science &amp;#8212; including ballistics, virtual autopsy, and crime scene reconstruction &amp;#8212; unlock the mystery of what really happened the night McLoughlin died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using her formidable talents as a writer, researcher, and forensic scientist, Debra Komar weaves a tale that could almost be fiction, with larger-than-life characters and dramatic tension. In telling the story of John McLoughlin, Jr., Komar also tells the story of Canada&#39;s north and its connection to the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company.&lt;/p&gt;" />
