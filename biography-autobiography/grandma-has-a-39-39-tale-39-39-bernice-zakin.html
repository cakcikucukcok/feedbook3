      <meta name="description" content="This is not a bushy tail, or a long tail or even a fuzzy tail,
but it is my tale. So here it ismy Long Ago.
In my long ago there was no radio, TV, computers, IPads,
air conditioning and many more nos.
There was just after the first world war and what came next,
which happens to coincide with my childhood memories.
In this regard I will endeavor to recall as many incidents as I
possibly can, and then perhaps my children, grandchildren
and great grand kids will be able to envision me in a role
other than Mom, gram, or big grandma.
Where to begin? That is indeed a problem. I think starting
with my maternal grandparents would be bestso here goes." />
