  <title>Never Sit If You Can Dance - Jo Giese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="•	“As dating and socialising have become ever more virtual, and thus distanced from basic human niceties, there are signs that millennials are hankering for crumbs of the gentler world in which their predecessors came of age.” (&lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;) 
•	According to the National Retail Federation’s annual survey, published in April 2018, 86 percent of Americans planned on celebrating Mother’s Day 2018, and they planned on spending an average of $180 per person—which means that Mother’s Day 2018 was expected to post sales of $23.1 billion. Furthermore, in 2018, 19% of consumers planned on buying books or music for their mothers on Mother’s Day, amounting to $494 million spent nationwide.
•	Memoir is one of the top-selling categories of adult nonfiction, and, as of 2017, adult nonfiction sales have continued to increase while adult fiction sales decline. (&lt;em&gt;Publisher’s Weekly&lt;/em&gt;) 
•	Book clubs favor a short read that will instantly provoke conversation. &lt;em&gt;Never Sit If You Can Dance&lt;/em&gt; is a short, engaging read." />
