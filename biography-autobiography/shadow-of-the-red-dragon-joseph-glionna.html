  <title>Shadow of the Red Dragon - Joseph Glionna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Military policeman, Sergeant Joe Armandi was only nineteen, but he was wise and experienced beyond his years. His classroom was the poor and tough neighborhood where he was born and raised. One lesson he had learned was simple but true: Evil to various degrees lives in everyone who walks on the planet, whether it is manifested by a simple hurtful word, the commission of a crime, a greedy thirst for some object, or murder. Each individual since the beginning of time has experienced this truth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to find himself after the tragic and untimely death of Joyce, his one and only love, which put an end to his lifes dream, Joe found himself in South Korea as an undercover agent, trying to discover the traitorous American soldier selling vital shipping information to hijackers the Red Dragons, the largest, most violent, and extremely successful criminals in South Korea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using his talents and experience as a superior prizefighter, Joe infiltrated the gang whose leader, Won Pak, owned an illegal fighting arena. Joe made a lot of money for Pak and thus was cautiously accepted by him. After months of investigation, Joe still hadnt exposed the American traitor, but he had some strong possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joe knew everyone dies, and since Joyce died, he was ready for anything and feared nothing. Many attempts were made to seriously damage Joes body, even torture, and assassination was also tried more than once. All that mayhem ended after Joe stole a million-dollar treasure that everyone wanted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
