  <title>The Complete Biography of Prophet Muhammad SAW Bilingual Edition English &amp; Indonesia - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Complete Biography of Prophet Muhammad SAW The Last Messenger &amp;amp; Prophet of God In Islam Faith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prophet Muhammad SAW from Mecca, unified Arabia into a single religious polity under Islam faith. Believed by Muslims to be a prophet and messenger of Allah SWT (God), Muhammad is almost universally considered by Muslims as the last prophet sent by God to mankind. While non-Muslims generally regard Muhammad as the founder of Islam, Muslims consider him to have restored the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Prophet Abraham, Prophet Moses, Prophet Jesus and other prophets.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Born approximately in 570 CE in the Arabian city of Mecca, Prophet Muhammad SAW was orphaned at an early age; he was raised under the care of his paternal uncle Abu Talib. After his childhood Muhammad primarily worked as a merchant. Occasionally he would retreat to a cave in the mountains for several nights of seclusion and prayer; later, at age 40, he reported at this spot,that he was visited by Angel Gabriel and received his first revelation from Allah SWT (God). Three years after this event Prophet Muhammad SAW started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that &amp;quot;God is One&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prophet Muhammad SAW, may the mercy and blessings of God be upon him, is the man beloved by more than 1.5 billion Muslims. He is the man who taught us patience in the face of adversity, and taught us to live in this world but seek eternal life in the hereafter. It was to Prophet Muhammad SAW that God revealed the Quran. Along with this Book of guidance God sent Prophet Muhammad SAW, whose behavior and high moral standards are an example to us all. Prophet Muhammad&amp;rsquo;s life was the Quran. He understood it, he loved it and he lived his life based on its standards. He taught us to recite the Holy Quran, to live by its principles and to love it. When Muslims declare their faith in One God, they also declare their belief that Muhammad is the slave and final messenger of God.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prophet Muhammad SAW taught us to love God and to obey Him. He taught us to be kind to each other, to respect our elders, and care for our children. He taught us that it was better to give than to receive and that each human life is worthy of respect and dignity. He taught us to love for our brothers and sisters what we love for ourselves. Prophet Muhammad SAW taught us that families and communities are essential, and he pointed out that individual rights although important are not more important than a stable, moral society. Prophet Muhammad SAW taught us that men and women are equal in the sight of God and that no one person is better then another except in respect to his or her piety and devotion to God.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ketika cahaya tauhid padam di muka bumi, maka kegelapan yang tebal hampir saja menyelimuti akal. Di sana tidak tersisa orang-orang yang bertauhid kecuali sedikit dari orang-orang yang masih mempertahankan nilai-nilai ajaran tauhid. Maka Allah SWT berkehendak dengan rahmat-Nya yang mulia untuk mengutus seorang rasul yang membawa ajaran langit untuk mengakhiri penderitaan di tengah-tengah kehidupan. Dan ketika malam mencekam, datanglah matahari para nabi. Kedatangan Nabi tersebut sebagai bukti terkabulnya doa Nabi Ibrahim as kekasih Allah SWT, dan sebagai bukti kebenaran berita gembira yang disampaikan oleh Nabi Isa as.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Allah SWT menyampaikan salawatnya kepada Nabi itu, sebagai bentuk rahmat dan keberkahan. Para malaikat pun menyampaikan salawat kepadanya sebagai bentuk pujian dan permintaan ampunan, sedangkan orang-orang mukmin bersalawat kepadanya sebagai bentuk penghormatan." />
