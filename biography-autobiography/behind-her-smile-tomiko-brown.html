  <title>Behind Her Smile - Tomiko Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lisa was only a young little girl who was raised without her biological parents and lived her fear behind her smile. From molestation and staying with different family members to wanting to be loved, it all developed into a mental shutdown. Searching for love in the wrong places, she finally grows and accepts her past and learns that what she had been through will not define who she has become as an adult. Lisa learns that her past life has made her stronger and wiser and begins to put all that love, time, and her past pain into her intelligent son, who brings her back to reality from giving up on her own sanity.
No one would have ever known and believed the things Lisa was faced as a child from her hiding behind her smile." />
