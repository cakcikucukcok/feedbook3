  <title>Alexander the Great - Norman F. Cantor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Alexander&#39;s behavior was conditioned along certain lines -- heroism, courage, strength, superstition, bisexuality, intoxication, cruelty. He bestrode Europe and Asia like a supernatural figure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this succinct portrait of Alexander the Great, distinguished scholar and historian Norman Cantor illuminates the personal life and military conquests of this most legendary of men. Cantor draws from the major writings of Alexander&#39;s contemporaries combined with the most recent psychological and cultural studies to show Alexander as he was -- a great figure in the ancient world whose puzzling personality greatly fueled his military accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He describes Alexander&#39;s ambiguous relationship with his father, Philip II of Macedon; his oedipal involvement with his mother, the Albanian princess Olympias; and his bisexuality. He traces Alexander&#39;s attempts to bridge the East and West, the Greek and Persian worlds, using Achilles, hero of the Trojan War, as his model. Finally, Cantor explores Alexander&#39;s view of himself in relation to the pagan gods of Greece and Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than a biography, Norman Cantor&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Alexander the Great&lt;/em&gt; is a psychological rendering of a man of his time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
