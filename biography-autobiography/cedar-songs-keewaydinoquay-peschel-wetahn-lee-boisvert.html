  <title>Cedar Songs - Keewaydinoquay Peschel, Wetahn Lee Boisvert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the 1900s, most Indian children in the United States and Canada were involuntarily taken from their families by state and federal governments and placed in Indian boarding schools. Keewaydinoquay Peschel was able to escape this fate. This book offers a rare glimpse into what one little girl did with this incredible gift she had been given. She was a child of mixed cultures and religions with an insatiable curiosity about how and why things work. This often got her into trouble, but also provided some of her best stories.
 Keewaydinoquay grew up to become a world-renowned herbalist, teacher, medicine helper, writer, and storyteller. She spent her life helping all other beings, not just human beings.
 All these stories, as told in her own words, are from Keewaydinoquay for all of us. She lived these lessons and now shares them in hopes that we humans are ready to take seriously the responsibilities that are incurred by the honor of having our place among the families of creation." />
