  <title>Abby’S Magic Mirror - Doris Asche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After her mother buys her a very special mirror at a garage sale, Abby Benton is anxious to hang it in her room. She loves to dream about whom it used to belong to and what kind of life they lived. Then one day, something very strange happens: Abby begins to see into the past!&lt;p&gt;
Abby watches as the lives of the Allen family unfold in a small, suburban house during the 1940s. The family fixes up the modest home, and the two girls, six-year-old Nancy and four-year-old Darla, make friends in the neighborhood. When World War II begins, Abby
sees the family put up blackout curtains, listen to air-raid sirens, and plant victory gardens.&lt;p&gt;
As the years pass, Abby continues to watch the Allen family grow and change, learning exciting and interesting details of life during the 1940s and 1950s. From the introduction of television to seeing the girls go on double-dates at the drive-in movie theater, Abbys interest in history increases. Abby asks her grandmother questions about her childhood during the same time period, and develops a deeper relationship with the past.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Abbys Magic Mirror&lt;/i&gt; offers an intriguing, detailed glimpse into days gone by. Come gaze into the mirror with Abby and discover
what life was like!" />
