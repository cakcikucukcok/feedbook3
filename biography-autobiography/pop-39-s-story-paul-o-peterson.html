  <title>Pop&#39;s Story - Paul O. Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paul O. Peterson, Pop, grew up in the Great Depression and has been a lifelong Chicago Cubs fan. You might wonder how such a man could have a wonderful and meaningful life. In grammar and high school he was, as his teachers described, a dreamer. What changed him in college into a man who found joy in study and learning? How did he discover what was important in life after suffering the loss of his wife and later his job, when he was given early retirement? What guided him through those times to a new life of love and service? 
Pops Story provides the answers to these and many other questions that will bring a greater understanding of who he is to all who read his heartwarming story. He and his wife, Carolyn, raised three sons who have been a source of great pride. He found that it is more rewarding to give than to receive. That a lasting legacy is given by pouring love and experience into people and not through money and material things. He learned that by giving you get greater reward, return, and joy in your life." />
