  <title>How to Do Mission Action Planning - Sue Mayfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;How to do Mission Action Planning&lt;/i&gt; (SPCK, 2009) was the first book to appear on the subject. At the time, the MAP process was beginning to have a significant impact in helping churches to listen to God, focus on mission, and be effective in making new disciples. Since then the authors have been amazed by the growth of MAP, and encouraged by the responses of those who found their book useful and have asked them to write again. Aware of the need for more critical evaluation and theological reflection, they draw - in this fully revised and expanded edition - on the experiences of people who have been using the MAP process in different contexts than their own: Fr Damian Feeney, parish priest and Catholic Missioner of Lichfield diocese Canon David Banbury, Leader of the Parish Mission Support Department, Blackburn diocese The Rt Revd Dr Alan Smith, Bishop of St Albans Dr Stephen Hance, Canon Missioner of Southwark diocese Linda Rayner, the United Reformed Church Co-ordinator for Fresh Expressions The result is a hugely engaging volume which argues convincingly that MAP is all about spirituality (not just a management tool), and a continuing process (rather than something you write, put on the wall, and glance at occasionally!) Praise for the first edition: ‘The book is very hands on, providing clear guidance about how MAP can help parishes and dioceses envisage their future . . . Along the way the authors provide a number of insights that give much pause for thought . . .’ &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Theology&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Both of the authors are extremely well qualified in using MAP . . . Anyone already involved in MAP would benefit from reading it. It will become, I hope, the starting point for the many parishes that have not yet begun to explore this kind of tool. &lt;b&gt;Dr Steven Croft, &lt;i&gt;Church Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
