&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Story about how French man found his father, his American family after 28 years of searching&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PARIS, France  In How I Found My Dad in Texas (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.xlibris.com/&quot;&gt;published by Xlibris&lt;/a&gt;), author John W. Nelson Jr. shares a very personal story of how he found out about his birth father and his American family after 28 years of searching. Using his real name, Nordine Mohamedi, he details in the book how he was lucky enough to meet his cousins and his aunt in Texas for the very first time in March, 2017. The story tells how he found them all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story is the one of Mohamedi, who was born in France to a North African mother and an unknown American father. Mohamedi spent more than half his life looking for his father whose name was the only thing he knew of him. In 2016, at the age of 50, he eventually found the truth. His father had been dead for a long time, but Mohamedi, from France, was able to get in touch with his Texan family, whom he was eventually lucky enough to meet in person later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a story about perseverance and love. It took time to find the truth about someone that the main character missed for his whole life. When he discovered his American family, it was such a miracle, says Nelson on what he thinks is his books appeal to readers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nelson invites readers to get to know his story and find out how hope and perseverance paved the way in finding the truth about his father who he has not known since birth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
