  <title>Overcoming Obstacles in My Life - Linda M. Green</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I came out of a very bad marriage and divorce.  So many times I wanted to scream and run away and even give up.  But inside of me was strength to go on. I did not know what it was but I find myself encouraging people as if nothing was going on.  I could not believe what was happening to me.  As I was giving of myself, I was getting back the encouragement and help I really needed.  I gave and it was given unto me.  Raising four children and working full time job every day was a full time job alone. It takes more than man to accomplish these tasks.  I had many positive supports to help alone the way.  You are not alone.  I call on my God  for help each and every day.
This is for all those who are reaching out for help and needing help to get out of very difficult circumstances and situations.  Sometimes you may think there is no way out of your difficulties and circumstances, but there is a way.  Everyone has different paths to walk in life.  But it does not have to end prematurely.  This is book will help everyone that is reaching out and continue their life journey in fullness of life and to be thankful  that you can go to the other side and be a survivor.  This book will heal many hearts that are hurting and discouraged.  Help them go on the next mile.  It will give them vision and an everlasting hope.  Did you know that you are a very precious individual and you were born for greatness and a divine purpose?  Just believe that you are.  There is much opposition in life, but there are many victories.  You can make the choice and run with it.   As you make the choice, you will not only see the victories, but bring others that need your guidance.  For example, your children, mother, father, grandparents, uncles, aunts, husband, wife, grandchildren.  People lead by examples.  Which example you will be? When you make the right choices, you will have the right results.  REMEMBER  YOU CAN DO IT.  I CAN DO ALL THING THROUGH CHRIST WHICH STRENGTHEN ME" />
