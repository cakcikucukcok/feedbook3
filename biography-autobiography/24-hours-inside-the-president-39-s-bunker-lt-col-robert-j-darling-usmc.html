  <title>24 Hours Inside the President&#39;s Bunker - Lt. Col. Robert J. Darling Usmc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After Maj. Robert J. Darling organizes President Bushs trip to Florida on Sept. 10, 2001, he believes the next couple of days will be quiet. He has no idea that a war is about to begin.
The next day, after terrorists crash airliners into the World Trade Center towers and the Pentagon, Maj. Darling rushes to the presidents underground chamber at the White House.  There, he takes on the task of liaison between the vice president, national security advisor and the Pentagon. He works directly with the National Command Authority, and hes in the room when Vice President Cheney orders two fighter jets to get airborne in order to shoot down United Flight 93.
Throughout the attacks, Maj. Darling witnesses the unprecedented actions that leaders are taking to defend America. As Vice President Cheney, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and others make decisions at a lightning pace with little or no deliberation, hes there to lend his support.
Follow Darlings story as he becomes a Marine Corps aviator and rises through the ranks to play an incredible role in responding to a crisis that changed the world in &lt;i&gt;9-11-01: The White House: 24 Hours Inside the Presidents Bunker.&lt;/i&gt;" />
