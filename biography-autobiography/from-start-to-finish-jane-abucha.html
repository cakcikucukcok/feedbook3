  <title>From Start to Finish - Jane Abucha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This memoir was written to help tell the story of Dr. Jane Abucha, DNP, as a mother, professional nurse, and human being with ambitions and big dreams. For Jane, a dream is a dream, and it doesnt matter how long it takes you. Just be focused and remain persistent on it until you reach your goal. The book also tells the untold stories of many others who live under these same conditions as refugees in South Sudan and who also go through the challenges of life in the United States of America (USA). It further outlines office politics that working parents face in the nursing profession, which can hinder the ability of one to provide for their children and care for them. 
This memoir highlights many of the experiences of Jane in her life in more than three countries. Some of these experiences are good, and some are bad. Though there are two sides to a coin and most other things such as two hands, legs, eyes, and nostrils, the best can be made possible out of life. Dr. Jane Abucha chose to live her life with the best and never to forget about the others who are unfortunate. She also chose to write about them to help others understand that, with all the challenges and problems in life, life is still possible, and you can still prevail. Aulogo kumba ulu lelegasi is the saying in Madi language." />
