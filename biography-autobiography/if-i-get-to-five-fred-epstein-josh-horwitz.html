  <title>If I Get to Five - Fred Epstein, Josh Horwitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon shares the lessons of courage, compassion, and resilience that he&#39;s learned from his exceptional young patients&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I Get to Five&lt;/i&gt; is a one-of-a-kind book by a one-of-a-kind human being. The medical world knows him as Fred Epstein, M.D., the neurosurgeon who pioneered life-saving procedures for previously inoperable tumors in children. His patients and their families know him simply as Dr. Fred, the &quot;miracle man&quot; who has extended them both a healing hand and an open heart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I simply can&#39;t accept the idea of kids dying,&quot; is how Epstein explains his commitment to saving patients. As a child, he had to overcome severe learning disabilities to realize his dream of becoming a doctor. Later, as the world&#39;s leading pediatric neurosurgeon, he did whatever it took to rescue children that other doctors had given up on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein credits his young patients as his most important teachers. &quot;We tend to think of children as fragile, little people,&quot; he writes. &quot;To me, they&#39;re giants.&quot; &lt;i&gt;If I Get to Five&lt;/i&gt; relates the unforgettable experiences he&#39;s shared with children-lessons in courage, compassion, love, and hope-that we can all draw on to overcome adversity at any stage of life. In &lt;i&gt;If I Get to Five&lt;/i&gt;, Epstein meditates on these lessons at a time when they parallel his own experiences, as he recovers from a near-fatal head injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If I Get to Five&lt;/i&gt; is a riveting profile of courage and compassion. No one who reads this remarkable book will ever look at children-or adversity-in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
