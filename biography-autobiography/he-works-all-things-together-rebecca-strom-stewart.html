  <title>He Works All Things Together... - Rebecca Strom-Stewart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the true story of how one woman survived a tragedy that occurred when she was an innocent child. It left her not only suddenly blind, but also severely brain injured. It is the account of how her faith in God and her refusal to give up finally brought her true redemption. 
She was twelve years old when it happened, the unthinkable, she was suddenly struck blind. It was so horrible; she could hardly utter the words...Im blind. 
Her mother tried to right the situation the only way she could think of: she sued the doctor. When the lawsuit was over, her daughter was still blind; but at least she was rich. 
Things went very wrong for this young woman when her parents took matters into their hands and attempted to protect her from herself. The greed of some and the misguided good intentions of others culminated into a miscarriage of justice for this young woman that has stolen the best years of her life. 
This is the account of what happened to Ms. Stewart and her family when a guardianship was allowed to run amuck, trying to destroy the very person it was supposed to protect. 
Among other issues, in this story Ms. Stewart tells how she and her family finally managed to climb out from under a broken legal system and what they had to go through in order to achieve their escape." />
