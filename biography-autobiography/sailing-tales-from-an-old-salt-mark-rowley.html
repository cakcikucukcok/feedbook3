  <title>Sailing Tales from an Old Salt - Mark Rowley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a seafaring story with multiple aspects.  Information gleamed by the author is from 20+ years of sea-logs, is a narrative or comments by the captain of an off coming watch on an ocean vessel whereas the author was a member.  By multiple aspects, I refer to facts, that while the story is based on facts, especially the strange events, the remainder I have taken the privilege of a fictional book to deviate from the &quot;rume line&quot;.  I have inserted my sense of humor whenever possible, also from events that have occurred.  I have been told my sense of humor is dry but Im positive you will have a laugh or two!  As a disclaimer; I end the yarn by sailing through the horizon oil spill in the northern Gulf of Mexico.  I was there for the event but on a power vessel with log entries and pictures to document my participation in the failed off-shore clean-up of the mess left to us by an old ally from Europe.
What is not in the book is that I contracted a lung disease from this experience.  Many local good men and women did also.  Furthermore, some have passed, but my rendition in the book is accurate as to the conditions at sea with as much as possible, emotions withheld.  I believe that both sailor and non will enjoy this yarn and possibly learn a few things about our precious water world." />
