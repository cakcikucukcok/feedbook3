  <title>Mar-a-Lago - Laurence Leamer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where Trump Learned to Rule&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To know Donald J. Trump it is best to start in his natural habitat: Palm Beach, Florida. It is here he learned the techniques that took him all the way to the White House. Painstakingly, over decades, he has created a world in this exclusive tropical enclave and favorite haunt of billionaires where he is not just president but a king. The vehicle for his triumph is Mar-A-Lago, one of the greatest mansions ever built in the United States. The inside story of how he became King of Palm Beach--and how Palm Beach continues to be his spiritual home even as president--is rollicking, troubling, and told with unrivaled access and understanding by Laurence Leamer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mar-A-Lago&lt;/i&gt;, the reader will learn:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* How Donald Trump bought a property now valued by some at as much as $500,000,000 for less than three thousand dollars of his own money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Why Trump was blackballed by the WASP grandees of the island and how he got his revenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* How Trump joined forces with the &lt;i&gt;National Enquirer&lt;/i&gt;, which was headquartered nearby, and engineered his own divorce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* How by turning Mar-A-Lago into a private club, Trump was the unlikely man to integrate Palm Beach&#39;s restricted country club scene, and what his real motives were.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* What transpires behind the gates of today&#39;s Mar-A-Lago during &quot;the season,&quot; when President Trump and assorted D.C. power players fly down each weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to copious interviews and reporting from inside Mar-A-Lago, Laurence Leamer brings an acute and unparalleled understanding of the society of Palm Beach, where he has lived for twenty-five years. He has written an essential book for understanding Donald Trump&#39;s inner character.&lt;/p&gt;" />
