  <title>Spiritual Trilogy - Stephen W. Hiemstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This trilogy combines three books published previously: A Christian Guide to Spirituality, Life in Tension, and Called Along the Way. Together they chronicle a spiritual journey during the period from 2013 through 2017. The first two books focus on the question&amp;mdash;who is God?&amp;mdash;while the third book focuses on the question&amp;mdash;who are we? The call to faith and ministry is personal but it is also corporal, being informed by the community of faith at one time and in one place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The original books have been reproduced as published. Offering them together makes them available more economically and draws attention to their common purpose. Because spirituality is lived belief, it is important to reflect on what we say we believe and what we actually practice. This reflective process is inherently stressful but it is a normal part of our Christian journey as we prepare in this life for the next.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hear the words; walk the steps; experience the joy!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Author Stephen W. Hiemstra (MDiv, PhD) is a slave of Christ, husband, father, tentmaker, writer, and speaker. He lives with Maryam, his wife of 30+ years, in Centreville, VA and they have three grown children.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Key words for this book include: Beatitudes, Christianity, spirituality, memoir, Christian memoir, Jesus, Bible, devotion, spiritual growth, and faith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;What people are saying...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stephen provides a helpful, accessible guide using the classic catechetical structure of the Apostles&amp;#39; Creed, &amp;nbsp;the Lord&amp;#39;s Prayer, and the Ten Commandments.&lt;br /&gt;
- &lt;b&gt;David A. Currie&lt;/b&gt;, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (In reference to A Christian Guide to Spirituality)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
We live in a fallen world. It leads to life in tension, and sometimes a life full of stress. Stephen Hiemstra takes us on a needed tour of the kind of character it takes to face such a life.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp; &lt;b&gt;Darrell L. Bock&lt;/b&gt;, Dallas Theological Seminary&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; (In reference to Life in Tension)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Have you ever wondered if the church in America is mortally wounded? Is God really dead as the infamous 1966 Time magazine cover reported? This memoir offers evidence to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;
