  <title>GUTS - Janet Buttenwieser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At age 24, Janet Buttenwieser moved to Seattle with a r&amp;eacute;sum&amp;eacute; devoted to public service and fantasies of single-handedly ending poverty. But within a year she&amp;rsquo;d developed an intestinal illness so rare she wound up in a medical journal. Janet navigated misdiagnosis, multiple surgeries, and life with a permanent colostomy. Like many female patients her concerns were glossed over by doctors. She was young and insecure, major liabilities in her life as a patient. How would she advocate for low-income people when she couldn&amp;rsquo;t even advocate for herself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Janet&amp;rsquo;s model for assertiveness was her friend Beth. She was the kind of friend who&amp;rsquo;d accompany you to the doctor when you got dysentery in Ecuador, nonchalantly translating the graphic details of your symptoms into Spanish. Throughout Janet&amp;rsquo;s illness Beth took care of her; then she developed brain cancer and their roles reversed. Eventually Janet recovered, but Beth&amp;rsquo;s condition worsened. At the age of 38, Beth died. To cope, Janet competed in endurance events, becoming a triathlete with a colostomy pouch.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
With themes that echo Susannah Cahalan&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Brain on Fire&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Gail Caldwell&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s Take the Long Way Home&lt;/em&gt;, GUTS is a story of resilience for the millions of Americans who manage to thrive while living with a chronic condition, as well as the many who&amp;rsquo;ve lost a loved one at a young age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
