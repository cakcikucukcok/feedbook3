  <title>The Reign of Tiberius - Tacitus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kings were the original Magistrates of Rome: Lucius Brutus founded Liberty and the Consulship: Dictators were chosen occasionally, and used only in pressing exigencies. Little more than two years prevailed the supreme power of the Decemvirate, and the consular jurisdiction of the military Tribunes not very many. The domination of Cinna was but short, that of Sylla not long. The authority of Pompey and Crassus was quickly swallowed up in Caesar; that of Lepidus and Anthony in Augustus. The Commonwealth, then long distressed and exhausted by the rage of her civil dissensions, fell easily into his hands, and over her he assumed a sovereign dominion; yet softened with a venerable name, that of Prince or Chief of the Senate. But the several revolutions in the ancient free state of Rome, and all her happy or disastrous events, are already recorded by writers of signal renown. Nor even in the reign of Augustus were there wanting authors of distinction and genius to have composed his story; till by the prevailing spirit of fear, flattery, and abasement they were checked. As to the succeeding Princes, Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, and Nero; the dread of their tyranny, whilst they yet reigned, falsified their history; and after their fall, the fresh detestation of their cruelties inflamed their Historians. Hence my own design of recounting briefly certain incidents in the reign of Augustus, chiefly towards his latter end, and of entering afterwards more fully into that of Tiberius and the other three; unbiassed as I am in this undertaking by any resentment, or any affection; all the influences of these personal passions being far from me..." />

The reign of Tiberius is nearly perfect, though the fall of Sejanus is missing out of it.<br /><b><i>THE REIGN OF TIBERIUS, OUT OF THE FIRST SIX ANNALS OF TACITUS</i></b> | Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (ca. AD 56 ca. AD 117) was a senator and a historian of the Roman Empire.

Out of the First Six Annals of Tacitus</i></b> | In this uncompromising historical study on the reigns of Tiberius, Claudius and Nero, Tacitus presents us `a series of cruel orders, endless accusations, faithless friendships, and calamities befalling innocent people' in `those times so corrupt and contaminated with sycophancy.'<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Reign of Tiberius - Tacitus</a> </h3></p><hr/>
