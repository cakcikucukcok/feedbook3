  <title>The Final Call of the Traveling Soldier - Betty Cooper, Thomas Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Final Call Of The Traveling Soldier&quot; is a novel
based on stories my father told me from his life and
the lives of his ancestors. Not only did I get the story
from my father, but also many elderly people that
lived at this time. Due to the content this book was
particularly hard for me to write. So with the blessing
of my father I enlisted the help of a good friend of
mine, Mr. Thomas Cook. I remember my father&#39;s sister,
Donnie Mae Campbell, loved to talk about the early
years. She talked many times about Pastor Daniel and
his life. I remember going to church one day and she
saw a field of cotton. She had me turn around just so
she could go pick some cotton. She kept feeling the
cotton and saying, &quot;This is what we had to do.&quot;
I hope and pray that this book is worthy of the faith
placed in me by Willie (Pete) Jenkins by entrusting
me with his story.
