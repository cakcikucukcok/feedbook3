Its usually older folks with the balance of their lives behind them and an investment portfolio in dire need of attention.

Then Donald OBrien walks into his office, gradually opens up about his story and pulls the young advisor into another world. Yes, hes an honorable World War II veteran, and Clark loves hearing those stories and helping heroes in their closing years, but OBrien was something more. After heroically flying night missions and battling the Nazis, he came home to begin a more startling occupation: master jewel thief. The doddering old man revealed a remarkable transition from ace pilot to the top of the FBIs most wanted jewel thieves list. Little did Clark realize hed soon have to make his own transition as hes inextricably woven into the dangerous world of accomplices, treasure, violence, and regret." />
