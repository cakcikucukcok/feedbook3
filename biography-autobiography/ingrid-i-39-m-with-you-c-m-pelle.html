  <title>Ingrid, I&#39;m With You! - C.M. Pelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The term Gaslighting, refers to a form of psychological abuse.  It is a topic, many clinicians and people are starting to discuss.  There has never been a written memoir, until now...  After Caterina lost her sister to drug addiction, she changed her major from liberal arts to psychology.  Caterina, eagerly studied and sought to understand the dynamics of her dysfunctional family.  Being in the classroom, made her feel like she was a member of the illuminati, and given the key to a secret door.  Then, she met him.  He was older, and not like the other boys her age.  He liked to have intellectual conversations about history, music, and art.  He was handsome, charming, and charismatic.  The pull was instant, and she was his.  Then one night, high and sedated by the drugs he gave her, she began to notice things.  She began to recall what she learned in class, in Abnormal Psychology.  She realized, he was Dorian Gray, in the flesh.  His mask was beautiful, but underneath, he was manipulative and cruel." />
