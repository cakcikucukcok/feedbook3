  <title>The Truth Will Out - Brenda James, William Rubinstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Motivated by scholarship and driven by curiosity, Shakespeare historian Brenda James applied a sixteenth-century code-breaking technique to the dedication of Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets. What she uncovered led her to the truth behind literature&#39;s greatest mystery.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more than 150 years, academics have questioned how William Shakespeare of Stratford, a man who left school at age thirteen and apparently never traveled abroad, could have written such a broad and deep body of work, one that is said to draw on the largest vocabulary of any writer in the English language. Now, in &lt;em&gt;The Truth Will Out&lt;/em&gt; James and history professor William D. Rubinstein explore the facts behind James&#39;s important findings, detailing how her work on the dedication led to the name Sir Henry Neville, a prominent Elizabethan diplomat whose life unlocked the secrets of the Shakespeare Authorship Question once and for all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Examining the true nature of Shakespeare of Stratford&#39;s involvement with the plays, the authors reveal the London actor to be a mere pawn, while Neville, the Oxford-educated ambassador to France and a member of Parliament for twenty-eight years, was actually the Bard. Disguising his authorship to avoid bringing scandal and shame to his family name, Neville spent a great deal of time abroad in Europe, entering a realm of aristocratic intrigue and mystery that provided the foundation for some of his greatest plays. With insightful explanations of never-before-studied documents, James and Rubinstein demonstrate that not only did the refined and worldly Neville know the landscape of Shakespeare&#39;s plays firsthand but that these works represent a total convergence of the events in Neville&#39;s life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the evidence proving Neville&#39;s authorship is not merely circumstantial.  Comparing mysterious signatures and Neville&#39;s richly woven family lineage, the authors paint a portrait of a man whose claim moves beyond the speculative. An experienced politician, who was well-versed in the intrigues of the Court, Neville was locked away in the Tower of London for his part in the unsuccessful Essex Rebellion against Queen Elizabeth. Using a collection of Neville&#39;s writings from his imprisonment, James and Rubinstein provide an exhaustive cross section of the intrigue surrounding Neville&#39;s life, exposing the events that led to his hidden writings and the cloaking of their true origin.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Captivating and elucidating, &lt;em&gt;The Truth Will Out&lt;/em&gt; is a revelatory exploration of two men and their times that will forever change the landscape of Shakespearean scholarship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
