  <title>Thalassemia - Jude Kamal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book Summary:
Jude, a normal girl until the age of three, was diagnosed with Beta Thalassemia Major that taught her to live life with passion and to be grateful for all her blessings. During the same year of Judes diagnosis, her sister Sarah was diagnosed with the same genetic blood disorder, leaving both their parents heartbroken.
Although Jude hated Thalassemia at times, blamed herself for all the struggles she faced, she made herself believe that enduring pain will make her stronger. Both sisters have kept Thalassemia a secret from their closest friends in order for them not to be treated differently. They were there for each other no matter what challenge they had facing them. 
It is a heartfelt and touching journey that unravels the unbroken sisterly bond, inner strength and the constant struggle that never seems to end." />
