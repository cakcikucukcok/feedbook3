  <title>Reaching for Answers to Crohn’S Disease - Martha B. Kalichman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Researchers have attempted to unveil the mystery of Crohns Disease and ulcerative colitis for years. The intricate complexities of these diseases still are not fully understood, and scientists persistently search for the missing puzzle pieces. While studies have been done on the effects of a restricted sugar diet and also the effects of probiotics, research combining the two approaches is lacking. However, preliminary scientific evidence has revealed clues to the credibility of the treatment that Dr. J. Rainer Poley recommends. His approach of suggesting a sucrose-restricted diet and taking a reliable probiotic, such as the one containing Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG (ATC53103), has initiated the continued remission of Crohns disease for the authors daughter and others.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. Rainer Poley, MD, a pediatric gastroenterologist, retired in 2011 after being in practice for 50 years. He graduated from the Medical University of Innsbruck, Austria, and completed his pediatric and gastroenterology residency at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. He is the author and coauthor of many published medical articles. Currently, he is writing several medical papers about gastrointestinal topics.&lt;p&gt;" />
