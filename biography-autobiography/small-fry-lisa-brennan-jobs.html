  <title>Small Fry - Lisa Brennan-Jobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;Small Fry is a firsthand account of Lisa Brennan Job’s difficult relationship with her father—Apple founder Steve Jobs, who initially denied paternity of Lisa—and her life split between two parents moving in different worlds
&lt;li&gt;A brilliant innovator known for his complicated personality, Small Fry offers the only account of the mogul by his eldest child, who was born one year before the creation and launch of the first Apple computer (named “Lisa”—though for most of her life Jobs denied that he named it after her). It is a deeply personal story that unveils another side of Jobs from one of the people who knew him best. Walter Isaacson’s 2011 biography has sold almost 2 million copies 
&lt;li&gt;Aaron Sorkin, who wrote the screenplay for the 2015 feature film Steve Jobs, told Business Insider “Lisa didn’t speak to Walter Isaacson when Walter was writing the book [Steve Jobs] because her father was alive at the time. But she was willing to speak to me. She was able to tell stories about her father that weren’t necessarily flattering stories, but she would tell the story and then show me how you could see he really did love her.”
&lt;li&gt;Not just an account of a difficult, distant father and his rocky relationship with his daughter, Small Fry also gives a vivid portrait of  Palo Alto and the Bay Area during the first tech boom 
&lt;li&gt;Will appeal to fans of memoirs like &lt;i&gt;The Glass Castle&lt;/i&gt; by Jeannette Walls, &lt;i&gt;This Boy’s Life&lt;/i&gt; by Tobias Wolff, &lt;i&gt;Why Be Happy When You Could Be Normal&lt;/i&gt; by Jeanette Winterson and &lt;i&gt;Wild&lt;/i&gt; by Cheryl Strayed
&lt;li&gt;Lisa Brennan-Jobs has been the focus of media attention and profiles already—from Jobs’ denial of paternity, to her mother’s exposing tell all of their early relationship, to the numerous films and accounts of Jobs’ life. We expect a lot of attention for &lt;i&gt;Small Fry&lt;/i&gt; 
&lt;li&gt;Lisa’s aunt is bestselling author Mona Simpson, Steve’s sister
&lt;li&gt;She has written for Vogue, O, The Oprah Magazine The Southwest Review, The Massachusetts Review, and The Harvard Advocate" />
