  <title>FREUD IN THE CITY - David Freud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The ebook edition of David Freud&amp;rsquo;s universally acclaimed 2006 autobiographical account of his accidental career in the City and how, after a bruising 20 years, he emerged as one of the most successful investment bankers of his generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the inside story of some of the most interesting and controversial mega-deals of the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Freud stayed at the sharp end of the business through his 20-year stint &amp;ndash; conducting transactions in no fewer than 19 countries. Written with pace, humour and insight David Freud&amp;#39;s now classic account of his work and life reveals the tensions, the rivalries, the cock-ups, and the break-neck pace of life in the City during this period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the reality of life in the City and it is far from the anonymous shuffling of money between faceless institutions. David&amp;rsquo;s career proved to be a battle-ground of individualism, dominated by powerful characters accustomed to taking tough decisions in a pressurised, gossip-fuelled environment.&amp;nbsp; And as the global revolution advanced, a sense of desperation ignited extreme levels of competition, with too many financial institutions jockeying for position in a diminishing marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Freud was at the centre of it all. He played a pivotal role&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In the flotation of Eurotunnel, (&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;I later discovered I had sold the market a pup&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;) against the backdrop of Black Monday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;His Warburg Euro Disney team launched the first truly pan-European flotation, raising &amp;pound;600m &amp;ndash; only to be faced with potential disaster when the price went into tail-spin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The highs and lows of financing the Channel Tunnel Railway Link and admitting to Deputy Prime Minister, John Prescott, that they&amp;rsquo;d got their sums massively &amp;ndash; by &amp;pound;1.2bn &amp;ndash; wrong.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was part of the Warburg Group&amp;rsquo;s break-neck expansion which ended in humiliation and collapse. Then he played a key role in its renaissance as UBS when its new Swiss owners rebuilt the bank&amp;rsquo;s position - for a time at least - in the financial markets of London and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
