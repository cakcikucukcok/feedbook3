  <title>He Leadeth Me - William Beckford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this gripping and yet captivating account of a compelling true life story, William Beckford enthralls his audience with a story that will live with you - forever. He will transport you into his life and travel with him from his innocent childhood, the discovery of his nonexistent relationship with his siblings, through his depression and attempted suicide. The emotional abuse and neglect cycle started when he was a child, and continued through his teenage years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pages turn on their own as this compelling story exposes a tale of a black sheep, the mindset of the victim, the actions of the people he thought would love him the most, the betrayal of family and friends, and the walk towards conversion, healing and restoration. Your nights will be short as you stay awake, reading each page as quickly as possible so you may know what happened next. Intense does not begin to describe &quot;He Leadeth Me.&quot; Williams true story reads like a best-selling thriller - but it&#39;s not fiction. His story begins as a childhood nightmare and ends with Gods miraculous and victorious deliverance and restoration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of this book are real issues that we all face: learning to grow through pain, making decisions that will help us move forward, overcoming adversity, and trust in the power of God for healing. Centered on the people that were close to him, he brings his own cast alive with crisp dialogue and action - oftentimes breathtaking with brutal honesty. At an early age, he learned how to cope with adversity and loneliness. He found love, in other peoples homes. Never has a story been told of how a child had to fend off forces of evil and powers of the dark world. With no hope of escape from the flood of witchcraft and sorcery, he learned to trust God even at an early age.&lt;/p&gt;" />
