  <title>Dead Now Alive - Hermes Yanes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ephesians 2:1-5 As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins, in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient. All of us also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our flesh and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature deserving of wrath. But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressionsit is by grace you have been saved.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Find out how Hermes Yanes was once dead in his sins blindly not knowing he was obeying the devil who is now at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God. In Hermes own very nature he was subject to Gods anger. Discover how Hermes shows the love, mercy and grace of God that made him alive with Christ today. Learn how Hermes went from fear to fearless, from hopeless to hope, from a dream gone wrong to having a brand new vision, from being blinded spiritually to finally seeing it through. Do not throw in the towel! Its not what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;" />
