  <title>Alot - Tom Parham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My friend the late Hilton Yow and I talked often, mostly about sports, his beloved daughters, his really bad hip, and religion. Hilton was a strong born again. My dad was a Southern Baptist Minister.
Hilton got my attention on TV. While channel-hopping, I spied him, next in line to be healed. The would-be healer called Hilton up. He put it like this: Come on up, sir, and tell us what is wrong.
Im thinking hip all the way. But just as Hilton started to speak, the healer admonished my friend, No, dont say anything. Ill tell you where it is!
My initial thought was that that was a little risky, even for a healer.
Without a word from Hilton, the reverend began to trace with his forefinger parts of Hiltons lower face, his neck, and his upper shoulders.
He looked confidently at Hilton and suggested, Im getting it, arent I?
Hilton looked chagrined yet still hopeful, adding this, his only comment: Well, no. But go ahead and get all of it while you are in there!
My first attempt at writing a book (Play Is Where Life Is [2007]) included a variation of this true story.
But I didnt get it all.
Allthis time includes parts of Play Is Where Life Is that bear repeating. And large portions of a blog (www.tomparham.wordpress.com), which has nearly one hundred articles on a variety of subjects.
With the help of Johnnie Bonehead Dennis, I produced Nearly Fifty in 2013. A coffee-tablestyled book, I tried to portray almost fifty years of friendship among a group of buddies who held the first of these gatherings with a Super Bowl party, the first Super Bowl. We havent missed a year, Classic Americana and friendship. Included is a history in text and photos.
I have to apologize for the blog guide. I tried to set it up myself, and that didnt work too well. The best I can offer is that all of the articles can eventually be found on the blog. In this book, I put the blog articles used in the text in the text order they are used. Additional blog articles that seemed appropriate for this book then appear as a group at the end of the text.
That confuses even the author. Now to piss you off.
There are two parts (A and B) that are new. Part A deals with serious stuff, while Part B is much lighter and hopefully fun stuff.
The old coach in me couldn&#39;t resist several new tennis thoughts. As well as considerable classic information some may not have seen.
Getting it all is tough work. Some are serious as a heart attack. Some are trivial. No one will get it all. Or like it all, but you may not like all my music, but stay with me. Ill find you (Ray Charles)." />
