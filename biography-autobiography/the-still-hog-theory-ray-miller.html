  <title>The Still Hog Theory - Ray Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Still Hog Theory captures the life and times of Ray Miller who grew up in the rural South.  He was born at the end of the Great Depression and the start of World War II.  His vivid memory of events of early childhood allows him to portray what these events meant to real people.  
He tells of the many adventures of growing up far removed from modern conveniences.  His childhood was spent around a mill complex consisting of a corn mill, cotton gin, lumber mill and country store.  He shares the many hilarious events that accompanied these years.  He was an avid swimmer but never owned a swim suit until he joined the Army.  He was a good student in a two-room country school and shares the adventures of the many characters who attended.  He later attended a consolidated county high school where he played in the band that could have been the inspiration for the Music Man.  The ones who could think did use the think method.  He shares the strategy of running for and being elected Student Body President.
He attended college at Georgia Tech and for the first time in his life had the feelings and emotions of one being in a situation completely over ones head.  He was an average college student but received the education he needed working a part-time job in the data processing department at Georgia Tech.  He was graduated from Georgia Tech in 1961.  He entered the computer field as a salesman for a large manufacturer and writes of the rapid growth and changes in that industry.  
He recounts the history of his family which has been in this country since 1622.  His family has been in his home county for almost 200 years and the adventures of his extended family are captured in his many stories. 
The last twenty five years of his career he served as President/CEO of a data processing company.  He attributes the success of the company to the lessons he learned from watching three hogs during slopping time.
The Still Hog Theory is a lesson of the satisfaction and success that can be enjoyed by keeping it simple." />
