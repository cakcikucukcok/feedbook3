  <title>The Desert Column - Ion Idriess</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One hundred years after the charge of the 4th Light Horse Brigade at Beersheba in October 1917...&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&#39;The Desert Column is based on the diaries that he kept through out the war. Published in 1932, it is one of Idriess&#39; earliest works. Harry Chauvel noted in the foreword that it was the only book of the campaign that to his knowledge was &amp;quot;viewed entirely from the private soldier&#39;s point of view&amp;quot;... Idriess served as a sniper with the 5th Australian Light Horse. Enlisting in 1914, he began his diary &amp;quot;as we crowded the decks off Gallipoli&amp;quot; and he continued writing until returning to Australia... The diaries cover his experience of some of the war&#39;s major events from life in the trenches at Gallipoli to the battles at Romani and Beersheba. One of Idriess&#39; strengths as a writer is his ability to place the reader at the scene of the action... The diaries reveal a keenness of observation and a descriptive and pacey style that Idriess would develop further in The Desert Column.&#39; - The Australian War Memorial" />
