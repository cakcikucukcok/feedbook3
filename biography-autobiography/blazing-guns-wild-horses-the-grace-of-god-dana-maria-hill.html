  <title>Blazing Guns, Wild Horses, &amp; the Grace of God - Dana Maria Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is the story of one man&#39;s amazing journey, his destination and the intervention of an almighty God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tragic event of May 17, 1951 would change the lives of many families forever.  Numerous newspaper articles have been written about that night and what took place but this story is different from anything that was ever printed.  This is the event as it happened through the eyes of a 16 year old boy watching as his father was gunned down and died in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James Kilpatrick escaped the hand of death as he dodged bullets standing strong and brave to protect his family. The enemy sought to destroy him but God sent angels to camp around him and protect him.  That night began a long, hard journey to places unknown and dangers unseen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come walk with me through these pages as we pull back the curtain and view the life and testimony of James David Kilpatrick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Some names have been withheld to protect the innocent victims and their families.)&lt;/p&gt;" />
