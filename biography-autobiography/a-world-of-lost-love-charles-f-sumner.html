  <title>A World of Lost Love - Charles F. Sumner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A few minutes before my wife died, I found myself wishing for time to resolve our two issues, which we hadnt talked about. Falling in the bathroom and breaking her hip was one. She felt I should have run into the bathroom and saved her. I was not prepared to save her psychologically and didnt have time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other issue was a rape eighteen months before at the city swimming pool in the dressing room. My lady was a young seventy-six years old with Hepatitis C and blind. She had no strength to defend herself from a large and muscular woman, assaulting her because of a failed friendship. I might have hurried to save her from falling, and I did not take her trauma from her with love and through Jesus Christ. I was inhibited and failed her in her fall. I would have no freedom to live on if we hadnt been saved by Christ by the understanding I carried in my face. I sat down near her and prayed for Jesus Christ to come into my sorrow in my face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My lady opened her blind eyes and saw my feelings with Christ of sorrow and smiled instantly, twice, with a huge happiness that Id never seen in her for over forty-five years of marriage. It was a smile of goodness and happiness, that she gave me an image of my wife ten years earlier, when she hadnt experienced rape. I thank my lady and Jesus for giving us this wonderful ending to her life and the resolution of our conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
