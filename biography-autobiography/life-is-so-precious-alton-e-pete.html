  <title>Life Is so Precious - Alton E. Pete</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this incredible book, Alton E. Pete raises awareness to a number of imperative topics people are facing today. Pete shares personal tips and advice on how to deal with family issues, adversities and more. Petes purpose for writing this book is to encourage individuals to get back on track, to believe in the values of life itself and the importance of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the fast pace of todays world and its technological advances, many are overwhelmed and functioning under high levels of stress. However, life gives back what we put into it. Just about everyone gets stuck between lifes shifts and curves at one time or another, which happens to change our style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pete expounds upon a period in which he overcame several adversities that had him asking God, why me?.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through such trials he came to the realization that when God has a plan for your life, you can try to run but you cant hide. Ultimately, God desires to get glory from and through your life. So, when you are feeling weak, repeat to yourself that you are strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We dont always have to wait until the holiday seasons are here. We can express so many forms of love every single day to as many as we can. Lose the fear. Its ok to be aware, just dont let your love for one another slip or fade away. Instead, let the brotherly love and the sisterly love continue; we are helpers of one another. Lets demonstrate and show the compassion of Gods love everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this journey, when your direction in life leaves you feeling a little weary or vulnerable. Remember, there is hope for the hopeless. God is still a father to the fatherless, hes God enough to be a mother to the motherless. Hes also a Perfect friend to the friendless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;" />
