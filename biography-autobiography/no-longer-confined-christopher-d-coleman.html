  <title>No Longer Confined - Christopher D. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At birth, he was not breathing and was therefore pronounced dead. Fifteen minutes later he filled the room with wailing, declaring himself ready to take on the world. He was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, and doctors told his mother he would never walk, never read, and never even know he was himself. Christopher, however, had other plans for his life.
No Longer Confined is the story of one mans fight for freedom. It began with physical and emotional imprisonment. From his wheelchair, Christopher shares his story of pursuing an unconfined life. His is a tale filled with joy and pain, victory and defeat, and yet he models for us how a life of adversities can be transformed into a journey toward freedom.
Christophers life story makes it clear that even if you have to start out crawling, you can live a life above the circumstances to which you were born. Success is born of transcending the expectations of others and growing into your God-given potential.
