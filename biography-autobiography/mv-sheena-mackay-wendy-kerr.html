  <title>Mv Sheena Mackay - Wendy Kerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For five years the River Medway was a second home, cruising right up to the top reaches of the river in an 18ft motor boat, but soon bigger things beckoned. Robin fell in love with a very sad looking Sheena Mackay, originally built in 1932 but now neglected and really in need of loads of tender loving care, not to mention a money tree in the back garden.
But after quite a few years, Sheena Mackay was ready for the water, and the start of all the adventures. Even though I was one hundred percent behind Robins dreams of sailing away, I was positively scared to death of actually doing it. So it was with great trepidation that we were now ready to do all the short trips in anticipation of saying farewell to home for a year or two.
MV SHEENA MACKAY is my book about our adventures and how I slowly overcame my sheer terror. Well, maybe not totally, but I am a lot better! All the places that we have seen, from the south east coast, along the west coast to sailing around Lands End. Then up the west coast of Britain to Scotland, with all the delights of some of the Islands, passing along the Crinan and Caledonian Canals before heading down the east coast, absolutely amazing. We received several lovely comments about the way Robin had lovingly renovated Sheena Mackay and it thrilled us when she was recognised as a Zulu Scottish Trawler. My confidence in myself has grown and I am doing things that I would never have dreamt, which includes writing this book." />
