  <title>Let&#39;s Go Get &#39;Em - Tom Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dan Colt was a big man. Standing six foot, four inches and weighing nearly three hundred pounds. Dan has a full black beard with traces of gray .He is a handsome man in his mid fortys. He is a bounty hunter and one of the best. This man has no fear of anyone, anytime, anything, anywhere, and he is the nicest person you have ever met, but some people make the mistake of riling him. Dan has the temper of a grizzly bear, but he has a soft spot for women and children. His horse Buck is fourteen hundred pound buckskin and has no problem packing Dan around. His dog Sammi, a female German Sheppard, now five years old and weighing well over one hundred pounds. He bought Sammi when she was four weeks old, and Dan spent many, many hours training her to his commands. If anyone did harm to Sammi, Dan would cut their throat, in one second. If anyone would does harm to Dan, Sammi would go for their throat in a second. She travels with Dan everywhere he goes. Dan carries a.45 Colt on one hip and a 14 inch Bowie knife big and sharp, on the other hip. An old timer that knows Dan said that Dan was chasing an outlaw and when he caught him the outlaw fought back. Dan cut his head off with one swipe of his knife. He reached down and unbuckled the outlaws gun and holster and hung it over the saddle home of the outlaws horse. He didnt take the rest of his body. He left that for the coyotes.
Dan said the outlaws guns saddle and his horse was his bonus. Then he put the outlaws head in a sack and turned it in for the bounty. When Dan came across a beautiful woman named Maggie. She was wearing a beautiful long green gown. She took Dans breathe away. Dan also came across a 12 year old orphan boy named Billy. He was pretty much like most boys that age. Kinda skinny. He had blonde hair with a cow lick on the back of his head. He always had a half dozen blonde hairs sticking straight up. He was growing faster than his pants. They were usually two inches too short. Billy was a pretty tough kid and he will prove it. Dan teamed up with a bounty hunter named Joe Cobb. Joe proved too many rowdy cowboys and outlaws that it was a bad idea to try their luck at challenging Joe to a fight. Joe was a big man about the same size as Dan. They also came across a very beautiful tall slender young lady that can damn well take care of herself. Her name is Abby. A little girl named Little Milly was rescued after a wagon train got lost." />
