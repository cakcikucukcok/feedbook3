  <title>Billy B. Burke:  Man of Many Hats - Billy B. Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, I have covered a wonderful, challenging, exciting life in these few chapters. God has blessed me and saved my life time and again as only He can do. So many exciting and satisfactory accomplishments still come to my mind that I have not recorded.  The sincere effort to help people in need as I traveled through a most interesting life, studded with excitement, challenge and the satisfaction of helping others who were not able to accomplish things they needed done has been rewarding.
 One thing for sure God has given me is a wonderful wife and family. He has guided me down lifes treacherous paths through the briers and brambles, across treacherous streams to a wonderful ending and He has given me the satisfaction of helping others that were in need along the way." />
