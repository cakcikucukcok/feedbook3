  <title>My Summer Vacation - R.M. (Dick) Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Summer Vacation is an autobiographical short story about nine wild and wonderful days on a camping trip with the author, his best friend Don, his Dad, Mr. Hall, and their family dog Sarge in 1949. The transportation was a 1928 Model A Ford, 2dr that had a top speed of maybe 45 miles per hour. The trip started in Rawlins, Wyoming and covered more than 400 miles all the way to Yellowstone National Park and back home to Rawlins. It turned out to be one of the greatest adventures of a young boys life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excerpt: Be Careful When You Play With Firecrackers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Hall occasionally would have a little fun by throwing a fire cracker out on his side when a fancy car went by. He was kind of intimidated by fancy cars. I think it was because he had to drive the Model A which even then was more than twenty years old. It was fun watching them slow down to check their tires and stuff. Don and I also had become very good at laying them down just right as we called it and we were getting a little cocky. Don spotted a flashy 49 Buick coming at us and he said Lets get this guy! Don took a couple puffs on the cigarette to get it real hot and I waited with the firecracker in my left hand for just her right moment.Now! Don said, and I touched the fuse to the cigarette and immediately flung it right past Mr. Halls nose out the drivers side window!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly everything seemed to start happening in slow motion!....................&lt;/p&gt;
