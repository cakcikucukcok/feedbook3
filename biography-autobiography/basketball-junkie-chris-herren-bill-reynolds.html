  <title>Basketball Junkie - Chris Herren, Bill Reynolds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I was dead for thirty seconds.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;That&#39;s what the cop in Fall River told me.  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;When the EMTs found me, there was a needle in my arm and a packet of heroin in the front seat.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At basketball-crazy Durfee High School in Fall River, Massachusetts, junior guard Chris Herren carried his family&#39;s and the city&#39;s dreams on his skinny frame. His grandfather, father, and older brother had created their own sports legends in a declining city; he was the last, best hope for a career beyond the shuttered mills and factories. Herren was heavily recruited by major universities, chosen as a McDonald&#39;s All-American, featured in a &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt; cover story, and at just seventeen years old became the central figure in &lt;i&gt;Fall River Dreams,&lt;/i&gt; an acclaimed book about the 1994 Durfee team&#39;s quest for the state championship.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            Leaving Fall River for college, Herren starred on Jerry Tarkanian&#39;s Fresno State Bulldogs team of talented misfits, which included future NBA players as well as future convicted felons. His gritty, tattooed, hip-hop persona drew the ire of rival fans and more national attention: &lt;i&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/i&gt; profiled him, &lt;i&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/i&gt; interviewed him, and the Denver Nuggets drafted him. When the Boston Celtics acquired his contract, he lived the dream of every Massachusetts kid--but off the court Herren was secretly crumbling, as his alcohol and drug use escalated and his life spiraled out of control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            Twenty years later, Chris Herren was married to his high-school sweetheart, the father of three young children, and a heroin junkie. His basketball career was over, consumed by addictions; he had no job, no skills, and was a sadly familiar figure to those in Fall River who remembered him as a boy, now prowling the streets he once ruled, looking for a fix. One day, for a time he cannot remember, he would die. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            In his own words, Chris Herren tells how he nearly lost everything and everyone he loved, and how he found a way back to life. Powerful, honest, and dramatic, &lt;i&gt;Basketball Junkie &lt;/i&gt;is a remarkable memoir, harrowing in its descent, and heartening in its return.&lt;/p&gt;" />
