  <title>The First Partner - Joyce Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1998, Hillary Rodham Clinton became the most admired woman in America while also becoming the most visibly wronged wife in the world. Standing by her husband, President Bill Clinton, as she and the nation learned the truth behind the Monica Lewinsky scandal, the First Lady assumed two roles--dutiful spouse and passionate defense attorney--which she had played on numerous occasions during the course of their tumultuous yet politically unified relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now esteemed biographer and journalist Joyce Milton examines this formidable, fascinating woman, giving probing insight into the First Lady&#39;s character, her values and her career. In &lt;em&gt;The First Partner&lt;/em&gt;, Milton goes behind the scenes at the Clinton White House and explores the First Lady&#39;s involvement in Travelgate, Filegate, the Health Care Task Force fiasco and fund-raising for the 1996 presidential campaign, showing how these controversies grew out of the tensions in her political partnership with Bill Clinton. Milton also describes how Mrs. Clinton&#39;s defensive reactions to her husband&#39;s chronic infidelities have often misfired and have sometimes enabled his bad behavior. She examines the differing psychologies of the President and First Lady, yet shows that when faced with political accusations, they take a similar approach of telling only as much of the truth as is necessary--a reaction that has increasingly gotten them into trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meticulously reported and researched, &lt;em&gt;The First Partner&lt;/em&gt; offers keen new understanding of this complex woman who has infuriated and confounded as many people as she has inspired.&lt;/p&gt;" />
