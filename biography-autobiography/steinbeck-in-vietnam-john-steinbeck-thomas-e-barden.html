  <title>Steinbeck in Vietnam - John Steinbeck, Thomas E. Barden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although his career continued for almost three decades after the 1939
    publication of The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck is still most closely associated with his
    Depression-era works of social struggle. But from Pearl Harbor on, he often wrote passionate
    accounts of America’s wars based on his own firsthand experience. Vietnam was no
    exception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas E. Barden’s &lt;i&gt;Steinbeck in Vietnam&lt;/i&gt;
    offers for the first time a complete collection of the dispatches Steinbeck wrote as a war
    correspondent for &lt;i&gt;Newsday.&lt;/i&gt; Rejected by the military because of his reputation
    as a subversive, and reticent to document the war officially for the Johnson administration,
    Steinbeck saw in &lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt; a unique opportunity to put his skills to use.
    Between December 1966 and May 1967, the sixty-four-year-old Steinbeck toured the major combat
    areas of South Vietnam and traveled to the north of Thailand and into Laos, documenting his
    experiences in a series of columns titled Letters to Alicia, in reference to
    &lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt; publisher Harry F. Guggenheim’s deceased wife. His columns were
    controversial, coming at a time when opposition to the conflict was growing and even ardent
    supporters were beginning to question its course. As he dared to go into the field, rode in
    helicopter gunships, and even fired artillery pieces, many detractors called him a warmonger and
    worse. Readers today might be surprised that the celebrated author would risk his literary
    reputation to document such a divisive war, particularly at the end of his
    career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on four primary-source archives—the Steinbeck collection at
    Princeton, the Papers of Harry F. Guggenheim at the Library of Congress, the Pierpont Morgan
    Library’s Steinbeck holdings, and the archives of
    &lt;i&gt;Newsday&lt;/i&gt;—Barden’s collection brings together the last published writings
    of this American author of enduring national and international stature. In addition to offering
    a definitive edition of these essays, Barden includes extensive notes as well as an introduction
    that provides background on the essays themselves, the military situation, the social context of
    the 1960s, and Steinbeck’s personal and political attitudes at the
    time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
