  <title>Lincoln&#39;s Smile and Other Enigmas - Alan Trachtenberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new assemblage of masterly essays from a foremost scholar of American history and culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Trachtenberg has always been interested in cultural artifacts that register meanings and feelings that Americans share even when they disagree about them. Some of the most beloved ones--like the famous last photograph of Abraham Lincoln, taken at the time of his second inaugural--are downright puzzling, and it is their obscure, riddlelike aspects that draw his attention in the scintillating essays of &lt;i&gt;Lincoln&#39;s Smile and Other Enigmas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With matchless authority, Trachtenberg moves from the daguerreotypes that entranced Americans from the start (and that Hawthorne made much of in &lt;i&gt;The House of Seven Gables&lt;/i&gt;) to literary texts of which he is a peerless interpreter: Howell&#39;s novels, Horatio Alger&#39;s stories, &lt;i&gt;Huckleberry Finn&lt;/i&gt;, the cityscapes of Walt Whitman and Stephen Crane. In his exploration of the ways that nineteenth-and early-twentieth-century writers tried to make sense of the modern American city he also addresses subjects as diverse as Louis Sullivan&#39;s Auditorium Building, the Brooklyn Bridge, and the early works of Lewis Mumford. The celebrated author of &lt;i&gt;Reading American Photographs &lt;/i&gt;concludes his important new book with &quot;readings&quot; not only of the photographs of Walker Evans, Wright Morris, and Eugene Smith, but of the city images of film noir.&lt;/p&gt;" />
