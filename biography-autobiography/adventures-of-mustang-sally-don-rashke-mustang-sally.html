Praise for Adventures of Mustang Sally
I was charmed by this wonderful memoir from Mustang Sally. As a show dog fancier and breeder of English Springer Spaniel field trial champions (three in my house at the moment), I can appreciate this sweetand at times bittersweetstory from Sallys point of view. Dog lovers will be captivated.
Janet M. Hoehnen, Benton Kennels 
Adventures of Mustang Sally is a delightful, entertaining and poignant story of affection and devotion that anyone who has ever had a family pet will appreciate. It depicts the true and unconditional love our pets give and receive. The books informative and sometimes humorous peek into the world of show dogs is an added bonus.
