  <title>God Will Give Me Justice - John Bielski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They took roughly 3 years from his life. He will never be 28 again. Time can never be returned to him. It is lost forever. Read about John Bielski and the story as seen through his eyes. Go inside one of the most horrific jails in the United States. Underfunded, overpopulated, and corrupt. Learn about how a law abiding citizen ended up spending twelve months waiting for a trial in what can only be called a certain kind of hell. Our constitutional rights are being violated, and this book is an account of real events that demonstrate just how that happens. The names and locations have been purposely ommitted to avoid any backlash from the authorities, but this is a true story. In the land of the free, John Bielski believes that only God can give him justice.
I went over my whole life and recounted every time I came in contact with the authorities . . . police officers. I also wrote about the events leading to the arrests as well as what happened to me once in custody. Some of this is scary . . . really scary." />
