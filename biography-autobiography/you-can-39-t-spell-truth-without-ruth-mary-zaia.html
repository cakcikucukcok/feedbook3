An octogenarian who has proven that disagreeing does not make one disagreeable, Ginsburg is well-known for her pithy observations as well as her strongly argued dissents.

And I say, &#39;When there are nine.&#39; People are shocked. But there&#39;d been nine men, and nobody&#39;s ever raised a question about that.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;My mother told me two things constantly.
