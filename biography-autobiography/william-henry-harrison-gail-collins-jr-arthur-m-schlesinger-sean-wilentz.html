  <title>William Henry Harrison - Gail Collins, Jr. Arthur M. Schlesinger, Sean Wilentz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The president who served the shortest term--just a single month--but whose victorious election campaign rewrote the rules for candidates seeking America&#39;s highest office&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;William Henry Harrison died just thirty-one days after taking the oath of office in 1841. Today he is a curiosity in American history, but as Gail Collins shows in this entertaining and revelatory biography, he and his career are worth a closer look. The son of a signer of the Declaration of Independence, Harrison was a celebrated general whose exploits at the Battle of Tippecanoe and in the War of 1812 propelled him into politics, and in time he became a leader of the new Whig Party, alongside Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. But it was his presidential campaign of 1840 that made an indelible mark on American political history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins takes us back to that pivotal year, when Harrison&#39;s &quot;Log Cabin and Hard Cider&quot; campaign transformed the way candidates pursued the presidency. It was the first campaign that featured mass rallies, personal appearances by the candidate, and catchy campaign slogans like &quot;Tippecanoe and Tyler, Too.&quot; Harrison&#39;s victory marked the coming-of-age of a new political system, and its impact is still felt in American politics today. It may have been only a one-month administration, but we&#39;re still feeling the effects.&lt;/p&gt;" />
