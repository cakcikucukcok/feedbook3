  <title>Pushing the Limit - Gary J. Mello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I give you all fair warning; this story is mine. There are many like it, but this one is mine. I am my best friend. It is my life. I am an AIDS survivor and a Marine. I must master my rifle. I must master it as I must master my life. Without me, my rifle is useless; without my rifle, I am useless. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me. Before God I swear this creed, my rifle and I are defenders of my country. We are masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life. So be it, until victory is Americas, and there is no enemy but peace! Be prepared to get pissed off, begin to hate, begin to love, want to get violent. This may cause seizures, cause you to attack somebody, have you attacked, begin to question things, and quite possibly find yourself living a great life in reference to mine. You may also learn how to live without malice in your heart. I would suggest this book be placed in an adults hands, but if youre an addict or if youre thinking of using drugs, read further regardless. I also suggest anyone who is living with HIV/AIDS have a look also. I learned to relinquish my weapons and step aside, can you? I firmly ask you again, do not enter!" />
