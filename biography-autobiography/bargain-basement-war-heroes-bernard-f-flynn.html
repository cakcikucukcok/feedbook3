  <title>Bargain Basement War Heroes - Bernard F. Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A World War II Merchant Marine combat veteran does more than just rock the boat with this book. This grandpa opens up a can of worms that should cause some squirming in high places, past, present, or future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Kennedys assassination, Oswald, the State Department, Congress, and big name personalities are all featured and highlighted in Grandpas story within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Accusations of a criminal law that was enacted by the wartime Congress, which removed every government benefit that the early volunteers for the Merchant Marine had and reclassified them as migrant workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Why was there acceptance of the never-ending scapegoating of these brave heroes, which was nothing but pure, self-serving lies and distortions by the press, broadcast media, politicians, and higher-ups in the military? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Read the absolute truth about the Merchant Marine that is related in this book. You can make up your own mind about the wartime Merchant Marine. Their wartime contribution to winning that war is incontrovertible. Why was the report to President Truman at the end of the war kept a war secret and not made available until 2009, sixty-five years later? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. Read the authors take on the wartime start-up of his alma mater, the United States Merchant Marine Academy at Kings Point, New York, which is now considered the hidden treasure of our federal academies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. It is doubtful if any of our seamen, especially our African American volunteers, understood what really happened in the wartime Congress. Those thousands of widows and children who lost all benefits should force a federal disclosure of the facts, and the hope of this book is to put them all on full alert. The disclaimer and speculation is clearly indicated in the early part of this book. Read President Obamas response.&lt;/p&gt;" />
