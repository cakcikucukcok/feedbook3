  <title>Power to the People: The World of the Black Panthers - Bobby Seale, Stephen Shames</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;In words and photographs, &lt;I&gt;Power to the People&lt;/I&gt; is the story of the controversial Black Panther Party, founded 50 years ago in 1966 by Bobby Seale and Huey P. Newton.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; The words are Seale&amp;rsquo;s, with contributions by other former party members; the photographs, including many icons of the 1960s, are by Stephen Shames, who also interviewed many other members of the party&amp;mdash;including Kathleen Cleaver, Elbert &amp;ldquo;Big Man&amp;rdquo; Howard, Ericka Huggins, Emory Douglas, and William &amp;ldquo;Billy X&amp;rdquo; Jennings&amp;mdash;and supplements his own photography with Panther ephemera and graphic art.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Shames, a student at the University of California, Berkeley, first encountered and photographed Seale in April 1967 at an anti&amp;ndash;Vietnam War rally. Seale became a mentor to Shames, and Shames, in turn, the most trusted photographer to the party, remained by Seale&amp;rsquo;s side through his campaign for mayor of Oakland in 1973. &lt;I&gt;Power to the People&lt;/I&gt; is a testament to their warm association: At its heart are Shames&amp;rsquo;s memorable images, accompanied by Seale&amp;rsquo;s colorful in-depth commentary culled from many hours of conversation.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Admired, reviled, emulated, misunderstood, the Black Panther Party was one of the most creative and influential responses to racism and inequality in American history. They advocated armed self-defense to counter police brutality, and initiated a program of patrolling the police with shotguns&amp;mdash;and law books.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;BR /&gt; Published on the 50th anniversary of the party&amp;rsquo;s founding, &lt;I&gt;Power to the People&lt;/I&gt; is the in-depth chronicle of the only radical political party in America to make a difference in the struggle for civil rights&amp;mdash;the Black Panther Party.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
