  <title>Five Scores and Eleven Months - Odell Flagg-Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    I am grateful just to be associated with Elizabeth. She was an inspiration to anyone who came in contact with her. She was a woman with great leadership
    ability. She not only sought a place of importance but also made a place. Her contributions to the religious sector, education, and the community are
    limitless. She is one who showed by example what we should do to enhance Gods Kingdom. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The commitment of herself and her talents to Gods program and the spirit of humility with which she performed her varied tasks added to her qualifications
    as a leader.&lt;br&gt;
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    With the list of interests she had and the many accomplishments added to her credit, it would be utterly useless to use this time to relate the many
    avenues through which she worked. Rudyard Kipling says it best when he said She can dream and not make dreams her master. She can think and not make
    thoughts her aim. She can meet with triumph and disaster and treat both imposters about the same. There was something on the inside of Elizabeth that said
    hold on. She was a God-sent woman.
