  <title>Naval Reserve Officer - Thomas J. Caulfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Caulfield was inducted into the US Navy. The next twenty-four years of his life would take this young cadet from flight school in Pensacola, Florida, to a long and honorable career as a pilot and reserve officer. Traversing both the skies and seas between, Captain Caulfields life would also be about navigating and managing the twin and sometimes competing demands of military and civilian life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Naval Reserve Officer, author Thomas J. Caulfield provides a compelling window into the life of a naval reserve officer, and he shares what it means to be a reserve officer who needs to juggle two careersand carry them off in a competent fashion! Those interested in becoming military reserve officers should find Naval Reserve Officer enlightening as well as valuable, as Caulfield provides details about not only his military career but also his civilian career as a teacher, counselor, and professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it was hunting submarines over the Atlantic in a P2V patrol aircraft, navigating family life and a career in education, or rededicating himself to the US Navy as part of the reserves, Captain Caulfields experiences speak to a life of responsibility, commitment, and service to both country and family. Join him from the beginning and see what it takes to find success as a reservist, educator, and husband.&lt;/p&gt;" />
