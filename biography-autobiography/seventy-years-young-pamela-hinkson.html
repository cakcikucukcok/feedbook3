  <title>Seventy Years Young - Pamela Hinkson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This book is one of the most remarkable and the most entertaining of its kind ever published about late Victorian and Edwardian Ireland.&#39; - Peter Costello, Sunday Independent. &#39;A woman of considerable style and substance, her autobiography gives a fascinating glimpse into the social and political life in Ireland at the turn of the century.&#39;  - Deidre McQuillan, Sunday Tribune. &#39;These memories are crammed with interesting, revealing and often funny stories about people like the Balfours, Horace Plunkett, King Edward VII and a host of famous politicians.&#39; - Caitriona Clear, Linen Hall Review. Seventy Years Young is one of the great Anglo-Irish memoirs. Originally published in 1937, it now appears for the first time in paperback, with an introduction by Trevor West. It tells the remarkable story of Daisy Fingall (n&amp;#233;e Burke) of County Galway, who in 1883, aged seventeen, married the 11th Earl of Fingall of Killeen Castle, County Meath. Daisy&#39;s vitality possessed and transformed that twilit world of Catholic Ascendancy Ireland, a world in transition - from viceregal, country-house Ireland of Dublin drawing-rooms and Meath hunting-fields, now as remote as pre-revolutionary Russia - to the Great War, Easter rising and civil war Ireland of the early 1920s and beyond, when &#39;the country houses lit a chain of bonfires&#39;, and the tobacco-growing &#39;Sinn Fein Countess&#39; tempered a life of privilege with work for Horace Plunkett&#39;s Co-operative Societies and the United Irishwomen. Daisy Fingall writes from an intimate knowledge of the leading figures of her day and their milieu. A sparkling parade of personalities - Parnell, Wyndham, Haig, Markievicz, Edward VII, AE, Shaw, Moore and Yeats - comes alive under her pen. Seventy Years Young reanimates a proximate but forgotten past with all the power of first-class fiction, and the glitter and rarity of a Faberg&amp;#233; egg.&lt;/div&gt;" />
