  <title>Sterling Hayden’s Wars - Lee Mandel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;A master sailor when he was barely in his twenties, Sterling Hayden (1916-1986) became an overnight film star despite having no training in acting. After starring in two major films, he quit Hollywood and trained as a commando in Europe. Hayden joined the OSS and fought in the Balkans and Mediterranean, earning a Silver Star for his distinguished service. Hayden&#39;s wartime admiration for the Yugoslavian Partisans led to a brief membership in the Communist Party after the war, and this would come back to haunt him when he was called to testify in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee where he became the first star to name names.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After returning to Hollywood, Hayden&#39;s film career flourished as he starred in several films including &lt;i&gt;The Asphalt Jungle&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Denver and Rio Grande&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;The Killing&lt;/i&gt;. His personal life, however, descended into chaos. His bitter custody battle with his second wife led to his well-publicized and controversial kidnapping of their four children for a voyage to Tahiti. Increasing alcohol and substance abuse would take its toll, but Hayden&#39;s career would be revived as a character actor in such classics as &lt;i&gt;Dr. Strangelove&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Godfather&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, he proved to be an excellent author, penning two international bestsellers.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Despite these achievements, his later years were characterized by depression, self-doubt, alcoholism, and substance abuse. His life was metaphorically a series of wars, including the most difficult of them all--the war that Sterling Hayden fought with himself.&lt;/br&gt;" />
