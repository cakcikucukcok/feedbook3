  <title>Out of the Mists - Di Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Jessie Hickman, portrayed in recent years as the infamous Lady Bushranger of the Wollemi Valleys of New South Wales, had a very colourful life. Hers was a world of bush carnivals and buckjumping, cattle duffing, arrests and escapes, gaolings, reforms and more. Exposed here for the first time is a tale of deception surrounding a newborn infant, relationships, divorces, love, hate and heartbreak all mingling to create the complex life that was Jessies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her granddaughter, Di Moore, was sixty-seven when she learned the truth about her biological grandparents from an elderly country saddler. By the time he had finished talking, Dis perception of her familys history was shakenand her curiosity aroused. With the enthusiasm of a new family researcher on a mission, she began to look into the life-changing revelation she heard that day. With no prior inkling of what her inquires might uncover, she entered a world that had remained safely hidden in that well-stocked cupboard of disreputable skeletons. It is said that truth is stranger than fiction, and Dis research has given her new appreciation for that aphorism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Out of the Mists&lt;/i&gt; is by far the most accurate account of Elizabeth Jessie Hickmans unusual life, compiled with respect and honour by her own granddaughter. This is Jessies true storywarts and all. &lt;p&gt;" />
