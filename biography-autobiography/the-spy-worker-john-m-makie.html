  <title>The Spy Worker - John M. Makie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Petty Officer&lt;strong&gt; John G. Makie&lt;/strong&gt; of the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve did not realize what he was getting into in
			 the summer of 1942, when he gave an oath at Camp X under the Canadian Secrets Act of 1939.
			  He was only seventeen years old and determined to defend the freedom of Canada. 
			He did so, in the most extraordinary way. He was special agent number 034, of the secret service group - 
			under water demolition squadron.&lt;br&gt;
			&lt;br&gt;
These secret agents were very highly trained commandos, who came from Canada, Britain, and Australia. 
These fearless men were scuba divers trained in small arms and hand-to-hand combat. 
They entered enemy occupied countries by the sea, carried out acts of sabotage and clandestine warfare. 
Then, they quickly disappeared into the night, back to the sea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These men had no name or rank, just mission after mission in Russia, Norway, Sweden, and France. 
This brave group of men, personally encouraged by Sir Winston Churchill, Sir William Stephenson, 
and Lord Louis Mountbatten set out to set Europe ablaze. When the war was over in Europe they set out to mop up Burma and Hong Kong.
 Yet no record of fallen buddies can be found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The year 1996 marks the end of the fifty-year gag order by oath and with it, the truth is finally set free. 
&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spy Worker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; reveals secrets of a time long, long agoall accounted by the lone survivor, now in his eighties 
which are finally free to share with friends and family. After many therapeutic sessions over the last ten years,
events of this forgotten group are starting to surface. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Although there are no records of their missions or medals of valor ever rewarded, &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spy Worker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; pays tribute to the 
unsung heroes of war in remembering their notable acts of bravery.
