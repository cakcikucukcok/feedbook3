  <title>No Problem, Mr. Walt - Walt Hackman, Raeghan Rebstock, Gordon Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No Problem, Mr. Walt&amp;quot; is a poignant travel memoir written by father, businessman and easy-going voyager, Walt Hackman, about his travels and experiences throughout China during his extraordinary quest to build an authentic wooden Chinese junk boat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Walt&amp;#39;s son was tragically murdered, his world collapsed around him. Seeking peace of mind and a new beginning, Walt sought to honor his son&amp;#39;s memory by bringing to life a dream that had long been delayed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
It is said, &amp;quot;the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;No Problem, Mr. Walt&amp;quot; is the story of how, despite his unimaginable heartbreak, Walt decided to take that first single step, and the next, and the next. The result is a fun and fascinating story about the people and experiences he encountered in China during the construction of the &amp;#39;Mei Wen Ti,&amp;#39; an authentic handcrafted wooden Junk, and the journey he took in the process of rebuilding his life as he built this extraordinary boat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walt&amp;#39;s travel memoir is an account of personal tragedy and tenacious triumph. It&amp;#39;s about the adventures and experiences of making unlikely friends despite significant cultural and language barriers, achieving and improbably dream against all odds, and the culmination of the &amp;quot;first step of a thousand miles&amp;quot; that changed his life forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with humor, drama, mystery, and suspense, this delightful memoir is interspersed with intriguing Chinese anecdotes, poetry, and recipes. Walt&amp;#39;s extraordinary journey to build a wooden boat ultimately helped him honor the beloved son he lost and sail new seas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
