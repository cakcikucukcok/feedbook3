  <title>Counting My Blessings - Elzie D. Odom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elzie D. Odom was born in 1929 in the rural community of Shankleville in Southeast Texas. The community was founded and named for his Great, Great Grandfather, Jim Shankle. Jim had been a slave on a Mississippi plantation when he married Winnie who was also a slave and had three slave children. Shortly after they married, Winnie, and her children were sold to a Texas Slave-owner. Jim ran away from the Mississippi plantation and walked more than 400 miles to find his Winnie in Texas. They were re-united and raised Winnies three children and six of their own in what became Shankleville, Texas. Elzie was born and raised in that small all black community. In spite of his humble background, he has enjoyed a 65 year marriage to his lovely and loyal wife, two successful children, and six wonderful grandchildren. He was the first black elected official in Orange County, Texas in 1965 and the fifth black Postal Inspector in the nation in 1967. In 1990 he was the first black councilmember in Arlington, Texas and became the first black Mayor in 1997. He retired from Political life in 2003 and credits all of his achievements to BLESSINGS FROM GOD. He and his wife Ruby live in Arlington, Texas where they are still active in the city and Mt Olive Baptist Church, where they have served for over 32 years. TO GOD BE THE GLORY." />
