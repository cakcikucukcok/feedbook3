  <title>A Patchwork of Pink - Bev Arnold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the age of sixty-nine, author Bev Arnold realized a long-secreted childhood dream. She released her debut country music CD, Never Too Late. Just months later, she found herself sitting in a doctors office receiving a breast cancer diagnosis. In A Patchwork of Pink, Arnold narrates her life story, focusing on her cancer journey.
At first, the diagnosis was a bothersome intrusion into her current excitingly fulfilling life. But throughout the ensuing months, this initial response was replaced by a deepening pernicious despondency, as she felt her life changing. She watched her evaporating dreams, hopes, and musical aspirations being replaced by visions of a desolate, obfuscate future. Arnold tells how it was an experience that intruded on and disrupted every aspect of the world she had taken for granted.
With her emotional response to cancer treatment infinitely more harmful than the physical, A Patchwork of Pink illustrates how her love for, and involvement with, the local wildlife provided her with often hilarious, sometimes tragic interactions, offering a stabilizing anchor to her emotional turmoil." />
