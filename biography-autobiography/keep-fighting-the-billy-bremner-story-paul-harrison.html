  <title>Keep Fighting (The Billy Bremner Story) - Paul Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Billy Bremner is a football legend. During his years playing for Leeds Utd and Scotland, his passion for the game and his commitment to the cause made him into one of the all-time greats. When Billy Bremner died in 1997 at the age of just 54, Paul Harrison was working with him on a new book telling the story of his life. Now, that unique material from extensive interviews has been brought together in Keep Fighting: The Billy Bremner Story. It covers Bremner&#39;s life from his early years in Scotland, his move to Leeds Utd and the glory days of the Don Revie era, his distinguished international career and his later move into football management. In his own words, find out what Billy Bremner thought of life at Leeds Utd, about his exploits for Scotland, his footballing friends and those he clashed with. There are stories of winning the League Championship and the FA Cup with Leeds, playing for Scotland in the World Cup, his controversial ban from international football and the libel action he won against a Sunday newspaper. And there&#39;s Bremner&#39;s own forthright views about some of the biggest names in football, from Don Revie to Brian Clough and Gary Sprake to Kevin Keegan. Keep Fighting is a unique, no-holds-barred account of the life of Billy Bremner - straight-talker and footballing legend - and is a fitting tribute to one of the all-time greats of the game." />
