Reeling from the news, the College of Cardinals rushed to Rome to congregate in the Sistine Chapel to pick his successor. Their unlikely choice? Francis, the first non-European pope in 1,200 years, a one time tango club bouncer, a passionate soccer fan, a man with the common touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why did Benedict walk away at the height of power, knowing his successor might be someone whose views might undo his legacy?  How did Francis - who used to ride the bus to work back in his native Buenos Aires - adjust to life as leader to a billion followers?

While the film and McCarten's screenplay would ultimately make this story about Pope Benedict and Pope Francis, it's strange to me how much McCarten's play introduces all sorts of superfluous characters, most of whom are almost non-existent in the original film.<br /><b><i>The Pope: Francis, Benedict, and the Decision That Shook ...</i></b> | ANTHONY MCCARTEN is a New Zealand-born award-winning novelist, playwright, and screenwriter. He’s written seven novels and twelve stage plays including Ladies' Night, which won France's Molière Prize in 2001, and Death of a Superhero.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Pope - Anthony McCarten</a> </h3></p><hr/>
