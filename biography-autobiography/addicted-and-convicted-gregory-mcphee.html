  <title>Addicted and Convicted - Gregory McPhee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I believe my poems are self-explanatory, and I have experienced them as real life situations. Raised in and around alcoholism, I chose the irresponsible
ways that led me to deviance. I can only blame myself for my misfortunes and tremendous suffering. At the age f eight, I was placed in a juvenile facility for petty theft, for being incorrigible, for missing school, and yes, for drinking. I was released just long enough to drown my sorrows in booze or drugs. I used fictitious ids. I have had 22 drinking violations. My last grade of school was 5th Grade. I was expelled from Kindergarten. My third wife has seen it all and now stands behind me as she sees the spiritual side of me. I have actually experienced my own death at about the age of 26 from an overdose of heroin, secanol, and alcohol. And, at the present time I have hepatitis C. I had many chances and as I look back, I ask Him, &quot;Why me, Lord?&quot; Now, it is my responsibility to share my faith, strength, and gratitude in these few poems with you. It&#39;s your decision. We can suffer or we can rejoice." />
