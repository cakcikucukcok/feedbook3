  <title>For Joys We&#39;ll Ne&#39;er Forget - John R. Farley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every Boy Scout camp has its unique history. This is the story of
one of them: the Curtis S. Read Scout Reservation, located since 1948
in upstate New Yorks beautiful and historic Adirondack Mountains.
The story is a mixture of fact, nostalgia, and youthful dreams. It is intended
to provide a lasting record of what went on in this extraordinary camp from
the day it opened in 1920 on Long Pond near Mahopac, NY to the present.
Written by scouters who, as staff members, lived parts of that history, it evokes
experiences that often affect entire lifetimes of those who lived them. It also
offers something of value to those of you who perhaps never went to camp." />
