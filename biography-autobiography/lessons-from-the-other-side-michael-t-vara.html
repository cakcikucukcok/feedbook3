  <title>Lessons From The Other Side - Michael T Vara</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this book, Michael T. Vara tells his true accounts of his experience of the paranormal realm. Michael vividly retells his own personal heartfelt encounters in having an Out of Body Experience, but also his close exposure to spirits from the other side and his short connection to the unknown dimensional universe through the psychedelic drug LSD. All separate, but many incidents that happened at different times during his life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He ponders many questions that we all have regarding life and death, such as... How many close calls have you had? Have you ever wondered how or why you survived? Could you make a subconscious decision to stay or leave at that time? In addition, if you could stay, would you have another opportunity to leave because you have already left a key at those doors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It is Michael&amp;rsquo;s hope, in reading this book, that you will begin to understand that there is nothing to fear about death, except fear alone. It is his firm belief that his perspective can provide you a better understanding to some of your own experiences, with the other side, while opening your mind to endless possibilities of this mysterious world that we all have been invited to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
