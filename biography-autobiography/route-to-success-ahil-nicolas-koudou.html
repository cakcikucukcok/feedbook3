  <title>Route to Success - Ahilé Nicolas Koudou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Route to Success: An American Dream Tale is an autobiography of an African child who grew up in a small village in Cote dIvoire. Unlike his own children, he was born under banana trees. Before and after his birth, no medical attention was ever given to his mother or to him. Despite the limited opportunities for a child during the postcolonial years, his parents thought that the future of their child was to be assimilated to Western culture. Hence, at six years old, the child was sent to school away from his native and natural environment. This early decision of his parents enrolling him in school led him to successfully complete his education in Cote dIvoire and later in North America.
This book is divided in five chapters as follows:
1. Building a foundation for success
2. Brief transition
3. Cultural transformation and determination to acquire higher education
4. Drive to pursue higher education in USA
5. Inspirational career
The lectures of the aforementioned five chapters present the challenges and the success story of the author. This autobiography shares the authors lifetime experience and sends a message to the future generation that hard work, courage, determination, perseverance, and strong desire to succeed can always lead to fulfillment of better life and accomplishment. Many challenges, strains, and pain have often left the author of this memoir physically and emotionally exhausted as he has gone through his academic and/or professional life. However, his self-confidence, self-esteem, pride, values, commitment to edification, and devotion to hard work are the major forces to successfully reach his goals and be able to share his legacy of success in this manuscript today." />
