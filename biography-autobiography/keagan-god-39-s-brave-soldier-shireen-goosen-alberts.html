  <title>Keagan God&#39;s Brave Soldier - Shireen Goosen Alberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Keagan was diagnosed with leukemia at the age of twenty-one months. The instant we received this devastating news, our lives changed instantly and forever.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Keagans diagnosis, I pondered the idea of writing a book, as I wanted to share our story with the world. My intention behind this idea was to provide insight or guidance to anyone who had even been in a similar situation.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, I wanted to share our ongoing journey with God, as we took Him into our lives. God carried us through our sorrow and pain, and He provided comfort and peace to our breaking hearts. With God in our lives, we were able to maintain peace of mind, regardless of the final outcome.&lt;p&gt;" />
