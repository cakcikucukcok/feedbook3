  <title>Panama? Why Panama? - Iris M. Todd-Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Iris and spouse, Chris, along with two delightful cats, were determined to move to Panama once retired. Not an easy task! Their two-year-plus adventure in making an international move proved frustrating at times, but filled with humor and excitement. Starting with a blog, Iris put herself to work documenting the ups and downs of the move and found there was much to learn despite her previously thorough research and decided to convert the blog to a book that would provide sensible alternatives to others who desire to make a similar move. The result is a useful, often entertaining, account of what to do and what not to do! Full of tips and references, this book deserves a place on your shelf if you too yearn for sunnier climes." />
