  <title>Flashes Through the Mirror - Phillip Yanke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was told I need to write a section for the book about the book. Well, Im out of words and too tired to think. Why cant I just draw pictures with stick figures? This isnt a novel; its an autobiography. Is not whats inside enough to emphasize in writing what this is all about? I cant explain everything because sometimes some things are just meant to be figured out.
In a maximum of one hundred and fifty words, this section must be defined. Sorry to say Im going to keep going past that because I have thoughts of unrealistic but words so intelligently intricate. Anybody can plant a seed, but how healthy is your soil? 
Theres no telling what my words say because I can explain them in multiple different ways. Im not trying to confuse you. Can you just really understand what Im trying to say? They can go this way, but then again they can go that way. Dont ask me. I already know what Im trying to say. If you have questions, you might as well keep them to yourself. My answers are all right here, and its not my fault if you dont understand what Im trying to say. Maybe Im not trying to say anything but explain how my thoughts come to you. No producer, no director, just straight angles in ways Im trying to write to you. Good luck, because nobody knows what my words mean but me. How Im directing them, theres no control to the wind that can shift them into a direction that youll have no way to go but one way to go through. Im going to put so much into this; maybe I should just add an extra page.
Im looking for a sound but dont hear a noise. Im sniffing for a breeze but dont feel any wind. I execute my steps, and maybe thats why I feel like I have nothing to walk on. The ground is planted, and Im on the ground. But somehow the air has taken me afloat to the clouds that can only bring me back down. Man makes concrete and lays it down. People walk over this concrete. I am the concrete. Thats how solid Ive become from the tramples to the stampedes. I dont care what you say from however to therefore, so with the cracks, you may seem to think it breaks me down. My weight limit exceeds multiple degrees in unlimited units of measure. 
I have two intros and an afterthought. What more do you need for an explanation for this book? Im designing my own pine box, but whatever you have for me, let God decide the rest on that. Be careful what youre reading though because I might not even be talking to you. If the assumption is the mother of all , then I must be mistaken. If Im your doubt, then I have nothing to worry about." />
