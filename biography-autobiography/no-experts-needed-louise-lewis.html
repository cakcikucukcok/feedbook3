  <title>No Experts Needed - Louise Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Losing a job always delivers a hard blow, but it was especially hard for forty-something author Louise Lewis, one of many victims of the technology industry&#39;s dotcom implosion. &lt;I&gt;No Experts Needed: The Meaning of Life According to You!&lt;/I&gt; tells the story of how she pulled herself together and discovered a new life of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
Just minutes after being &quot;set free&quot;, Lewis, a single woman with a mortgage to pay, sits in the San Jose, California, airport panicking over her future. While toying with the option of giving into depression, she receives a powerful message from God that instantly releases the weight of her worries. &quot;This is just a new chapter in your life. You hold the pen, I&#39;ll guide your hand, and together we&#39;ll write one hell of a chapter.&quot; through Spirit&#39;s continued involvement, Lewis is inspired to ask normal, everyday people to answer Spirit&#39;s question: what is the meaning of life?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;No Experts Needed: The Meaning of Life According to You!&lt;/I&gt; weaves through a vast collection of spontaneous, thought-provoking answers and inspirational stories that demonstrate how the simple act of listening to Spirit can add meaning to every moment of your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
