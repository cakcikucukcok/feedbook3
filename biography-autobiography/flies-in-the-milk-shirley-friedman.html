  <title>Flies in the Milk - Shirley Friedman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Flies in the Milk is the true story about the difficulties of two unhappy people in search of love in the 1960s  Sando, an Israeli Secret Agent, and Shirley, actress and singer.  They meet by chance in Johannesburg, and Sando phones for a date. When she reluctantly agrees, his strange question I wont come like a fly in the milk? reveals to Shirley a desperate need for love. Soon Sando is head-over-heels, but Shirley discovers he is married. She leaves to sing with a band in Salisbury, and when Sando follows, realises she loves him. When called back to Israel, he is interrogated when he passes through the Suez Canal and hailed as a hero, but miserable without his love, he sends her a plea to join him. The bliss of their reunion is soon marred, and though Sando is now divorced, they have to leave the country immediately. Their travels through seven countries are fraught with difficulties  bad accommodation, accusation of stealing, no work and very little money, amongst others.  Then, finally almost home, theres an horrific car accident and death." />
