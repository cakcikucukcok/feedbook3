  <title>The Five Sutherland Boys - Peter Sutherland Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, The Five Sutherland Boys  To God -Through Hell -To Glory, is a fictional family saga, is based on true life stories gleaned from my father Peter, and my four unclesLouis (Fat), Willie, Luther, and Johnny.
This book reads like (Forrest Gump, meets Private Ryan, Afro Style).
The book tells the life stories of the five young black men that grew up during the Great Depression, trying to make ends meet, while hanging on to family, and Godly values, in the midst of a World at War.
A war that was thrust upon them and the United States by the unprovoked Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, on Dec.7th 1941.
In the process of surviving the depression and fighting a war, they meet and rub elbows with some incredibly unique individuals.
Some were famous, and some would later become famous.
Travel With them on their heroic journeys, as the boys realize there is no place like home, no love like family, and both are worth fighting for." />
