  <title>From Kansas to Kilimanjaro - David A. Emery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For author Dr. David A. Emery, life has been anything but dull. In this memoir, he narrates some of the highlights of his long and colorful life. He also provides a background of his family tree, which found some of its roots in Kansas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From Kansas to Kilimanjaro&lt;/i&gt; documents Emerys decisions and their consequences during the international upheaval of World War II. He narrates how, beginning in 1942, he served as an ambulance driver in the American Field Service and became attached to the British Eighth Armys lead tank brigade in North Africa, where he helped save lives and nearly lost his own. Emery tells how he finished his education and became an industrial psychologist and family man. He also discusses how the Cold War brought him back to Africa with his family, where he became involved with the KGB, the CIA, and the FBI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With photos included, this memoir recalls Emerys adventurous spirit and how he found himself involved in humorous and life-threatening adventures: a KGB agent in Africa is outmaneuvered by Marilyn Monroes curves and how a Bedouin present of an Aphrodite olfactory provided elixir for a lonely soldier. &lt;i&gt;From Kansas to Kilimanjaro&lt;/i&gt; provides keen insights gleaned from one mans interesting life, but also provides a historical context of the world throughout the years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
