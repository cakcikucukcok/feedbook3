  <title>The Undying - Anne Boyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER OF THE 2020 PULITZER PRIZE IN GENERAL NONFICTION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;The Undying&lt;/i&gt; is a startling, urgent intervention in our discourses about sickness and health, art and science, language and literature, and mortality and death. In dissecting what she terms &#39;the ideological regime of cancer,&#39; Anne Boyer has produced a profound and unforgettable document on the experience of life itself.&quot; --Sally Rooney, author of &lt;i&gt;Normal People&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Anne Boyer&#39;s radically unsentimental account of cancer and the &#39;carcinogenosphere&#39; obliterates cliche. By demonstrating how her utterly specific experience is also irreducibly social, she opens up new spaces for thinking and feeling together. &lt;i&gt;The Undying&lt;/i&gt; is an outraged, beautiful, and brilliant work of embodied critique.&quot; --Ben Lerner, author of &lt;i&gt;The Topeka School&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A week after her forty-first birthday, the acclaimed poet Anne Boyer was diagnosed with highly aggressive triple-negative breast cancer. For a single mother living paycheck to paycheck who had always been the caregiver rather than the one needing care, the catastrophic illness was both a crisis and an initiation into new ideas about mortality and the gendered politics of illness. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A twenty-first-century &lt;i&gt;Illness as Metaphor&lt;/i&gt;, as well as a harrowing memoir of survival, &lt;i&gt;The Undying &lt;/i&gt;explores the experience of illness as mediated by digital screens, weaving in ancient Roman dream diarists, cancer hoaxers and fetishists, cancer vloggers, corporate lies, John Donne, pro-pain &quot;dolorists,&quot; the ecological costs of chemotherapy, and the many little murders of capitalism. It excoriates the pharmaceutical industry and the bland hypocrisies of &quot;pink ribbon culture&quot; while also diving into the long literary line of women writing about their own illnesses and ongoing deaths: Audre Lorde, Kathy Acker, Susan Sontag, and others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A genre-bending memoir in the tradition of &lt;i&gt;The Argonauts&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Undying&lt;/i&gt; will break your heart, make you angry enough to spit, and show you contemporary America as a thing both desperately ill and occasionally, perversely glorious. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes black-and-white illustrations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
