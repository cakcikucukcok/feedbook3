  <title>Pure Moxie - Leda Sanford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first woman publisher of a national magazine.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Such a slim volume for someone whos led such a long and interesting life (after all, Miley Cyruss autobiography is 288 pages)then you realize &lt;i&gt;Pure Moxie&lt;/i&gt;  is no doubt just like the author: smart, funny, candid, to-the-point and, of course, slender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;J.E. Vader&lt;/b&gt;, Citizen Moxie, &lt;i&gt;Pacific Sun&lt;/i&gt;, January, 2011&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Money, power, sex. &lt;i&gt;Pure Moxie&lt;/i&gt;  tells the tale of one womans journey from bored housewife to trendsetter in the magazine publishing industry. This is a story few women experience but every woman fantasizes about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cheryl Russell&lt;/b&gt;, Editorial Director of &lt;i&gt;New Strategist Publications&lt;/i&gt;, Former Editor-in-Chief of &lt;i&gt;American Demographics&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Sexy, sassy and sensational, &lt;i&gt;Pure Moxie&lt;/i&gt;  is a memoir that reads like a best-selling novel. The world of American magazine publishing was a frontier in the 1970s and Leda was one if its leading pioneers. A business success story, an adventure, and a racy read all wrapped in one, &lt;i&gt;Pure Moxie&lt;/i&gt;  is a page-turner, with an inspiring moral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Rybarski&lt;/b&gt;, Co-Founder of Age Wave Target Marketing, Author, &lt;i&gt;StartUp Smarts&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impetuous Leda Sanford abandoned secure suburbia in the 1960s in exchange for a life on the edge as a top magazine editor and publisher in the competitive and male-dominated Manhattan publishing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unorthodox entrepreneurs hired Leda at a time when women rarely occupied corner offices. Ledas memoir, &lt;i&gt;Pure Moxie,&lt;/i&gt; recreates a world of jet-setting opulenceprivate planes, five-star hotels, and a state dinner at the White Houseplus a headline-making affair. Leda became the first female publisher of &lt;i&gt;American Home,&lt;/i&gt; a major U.S. magazine with a circulation of more than one million. She focused on the emerging liberated womans demanding lifestyle and challenged the traditional formula of womens magazines.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From her &lt;i&gt;American Home&lt;/i&gt; launch pad, Leda pushed the industrys standards as she directed the creation and reinvention of magazines that included &lt;i&gt;Chief Executive, Attenzione, Modern Maturity,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Get Up and Go!&lt;/i&gt; In the early 1990s, Leda shifted focus to promoting a new attitude toward aging, emphasizing that its never too late to explore new horizons and enrich ones quality of life. With wit and candor, &lt;i&gt;Pure Moxie&lt;/i&gt; provides a unique glimpse into Ledas career and offers insight into womens changing roles as key players in the magazine publishing business. &lt;/p&gt;" />
