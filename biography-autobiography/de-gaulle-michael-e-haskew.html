  <title>De Gaulle - Michael E. Haskew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Michael Haskew takes us on a tremendous journey through de Gaulle&#39;s pivotal years, his leadership of the resistance, and beyond to understand the man who remade both modern military tactics and global leadership.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charles de Gaulle once stated, &quot;France has no friends, only interests,&quot; and it was this strength of mind and love of country that took the region from an occupied territory during World War II to a leader in the Allied cause. Convinced that his personal destiny and that of his beloved country were intertwined, de Gaulle&#39;s life&#39;s work was dedicated to advancing its preeminence among nations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even while the country lay prostrate before the Nazis, he maintained the honor of the French people, choosing to resist rather than to collaborate. His presidency was no less visionary; under de Gaulle, France became a nuclear power, granted autonomy to more than a dozen of its former colonial holdings, and maintained an influential presence on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
