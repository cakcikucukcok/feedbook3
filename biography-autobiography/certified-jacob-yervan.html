  <title>Certified - Jacob Yervan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book starts with the early years and gives account of the roller-coaster ride that was my life. As a young adult, I accomplished good and bad certifications as a result of the madness that befell me. It tells the story of the physical and psychological abuse I suffered as a child and how I was groomed and sexually molested by pedophiles. Despite the shackles caused by the abuse, in this book I explain how I became a successful businessman and traveled to Europe. However, the pressures of the business world and the mental illnesses caused by years of childhood abuse, lead to a nervous breakdown, which sent me spiraling down the rabbit hole. During this downward spiral, I became addicted to crack cocaine, lost my job, became homeless, had various near-death experiences, tried to commit suicide multiple times, became a drug dealer, became a drug smuggler, and finally, became a criminal convict in a foreign country. 
Inspiringly, it is not all doom and gloom.  This book concludes with a success story and conveys how I managed to overcome the two addictions, the mental afflictions, and the criminal conviction. I finally, achieved maturity and stability, and can maintain a loving long-term relationship, help raise a remarkable child, as well as maintain and progress a stable career." />
