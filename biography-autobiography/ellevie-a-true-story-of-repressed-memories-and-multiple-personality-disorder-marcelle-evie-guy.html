  <title>Ellevie: A True Story of Repressed Memories and Multiple Personality Disorder - Marcelle Evie Guy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Because there is a little girl in me...and she wants to take over.&quot; With these startling words, uttered to her therapist in explanation for her desperate plea to be hospitalized-to be somewhere &quot;safe&quot;-Marcelle Guy begins the compelling first-person account of her life ELLEVIE: A True Story of Repressed Memories and Multiple Personality Disorder. Marcelle is forty-two when it strikes her that the mystifying vision she has carried with her for her entire adult life-the vision of a seven- year-old girl, a stranger to Marcelle, strapped to a table, lifeless, being attended to by a nun-is no stranger at all. The little girl in the vision is her, carrying with her a terrifying secret, a memory long hidden. Now, the little girl comes to life. Soon, another girl will appear. Both personalities threaten Marcelle&#39;s control over her life and she becomes plagued by near-constant anxiety. In the literary tradition of Styron&#39;s DARKNESS VISIBLE or Kaysen&#39;s GIRL, INTERRUPTED, Marcelle Guy conveys her harrowing story openly, honestly, and courageously. How will she cope with the two intruders from her past, and the memory of the horrifying childhood incident they are bringing with them?" />
