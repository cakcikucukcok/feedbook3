Acclaimed by critics as a masterpiece when a hastily transcribed version was finally published in 1924, it quickly took its place as a classic second only to Moby-Dick among Melville's works.<br /><b><i>Billy Budd - Wikipedia</i></b> | “Billy Budd” is the final work of American author Herman Melville which was discovered amongst his papers three decades after his death and first published in Raymond Weaver’s 1924 edition of “The Collected Works of Melville.”<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Billy Budd (9781420956214): Melville, Herman ...</i></b> | The setting is the last decade of the eighteenth century. The British naval warship H.M.S. Bellipotent impresses, or involuntarily recruits, the young sailor Billy Budd, extracting him from duty aboard the Rights-of-Man, a merchant ship. Billy’s commanding officer, Captain Graveling, though reluctant to let one of his best men go, has little choice in the face of the superior ship’s demands.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Billy Budd - Herman Melville</a> </h3></p><hr/>
