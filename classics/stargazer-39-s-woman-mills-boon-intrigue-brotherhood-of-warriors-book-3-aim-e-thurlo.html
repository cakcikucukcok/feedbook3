          &lt;strong&gt;Highly regarded for his mystic prowess, Max Natoni took an oath to find lost people.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For only he held the Navajo tribe&#39;s deepest senses and the strength to awe those who beheld the man in the flesh. Yet even his heightened awareness couldn&#39;t help him when it came to Kris Reynolds, who had her own sacred crusade to uphold….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kris had no need for secrets, yet the noble Navajo warrior was hers alone to unravel. He had the ability to guide her, but not without pushing Kris&#39;s desire to uncharted territory. Bound by honor, together they tracked a killer with the same ardor that they stalked each other.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While Kris yearned for justice, Max sought to restore harmony to his nation…only to expose the passions of a woman who was more than his match.&lt;/p&gt;
