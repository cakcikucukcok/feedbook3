  <title>The Mortal Immortal - Mary Shelley, Michael Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the creator of &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt; comes the secrets of eternal youth, souls that exchange bodies, and ancient Romans newly thawed out of ice. This riveting collection contains all five of Mary Shelley’s compelling supernatural tales, guaranteed to delight even the most jaded of horror fans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;About &lt;i&gt;The Mortal Immortal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mary Shelley’s considerable fame is due to her great Gothic novel &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus&lt;/i&gt;, published in 1818. &lt;i&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt; is considered one of - if not the - earliest pure science-fiction novels.  Shelley&#39;s powerful tale of blasphemous creation became even more celebrated through its many film adaptations, from Boris Karloff’s iconic portrayal of Frankenstein to Kenneth Branaugh’s &lt;i&gt;Mary Shelley&#39;s Frankenstein&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;During Shelley&#39;s lifetime she published just over two-dozen stories, three of which were of interest to science fiction and fantasy readers. Two additional stories were published after Shelley’s death. “Roger Dodsworth: The Reanimated Englishman” was printed in a volume of reminisces by a magazine editor who had commissioned the story thirty years earlier; “Valerius: The Reanimated Roman” remained unpublished until 1976, when both stories were discovered by a Shelley scholar.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In gathering all of Mary Shelley’s unprecedented supernatural short fiction, &lt;i&gt;The Mortal Immortal&lt;/i&gt; adds to the legacy of a brilliant, innovative, and highly-entertaining author." />
