  <title>Christopher Morley: Two Classic Novels in One Volume - Christopher Morley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This single-volume edition of both of Christopher Morley&#39;s most popular novels will charm all lovers of &quot;books about books.&quot; In the first story, &lt;I&gt;Parnassus on Wheels, &lt;/I&gt;39-year-old Helen McGill is weary of keeping house for her bachelor brother. When red-bearded bookseller Roger Mifflin rolls into town, she impulsively purchases his mobile bookshop. Roger promises to teach Helen the trade before retiring to write his long-overdue book, and together they hit the road for a series of winsome adventures throughout New England. Their story was praised by Boston&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Evening Transcript&lt;/I&gt; as &quot;graceful in style &amp;#8230; [and] entertaining in every aspect.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;Roger Mifflin returns in &lt;I&gt;The Haunted Bookshop,&lt;/I&gt; which unfolds in&amp;nbsp;his Brooklyn store, the Parnassus at Home. The spirits of great literature haunt the shop, providing an atmospheric background for the tale of a young ad man, Aubrey Gilbert, who&#39;s smitten with Roger&#39;s comely assistant, Titania. When Aubrey notices a suspicious-looking character skulking in a nearby alleyway and is attacked on his way home, the ardent suitor fears for Titania&#39;s safety and turns amateur detective. Part mystery, part spy thriller, and part romance, the humorous tale is a complete delight." />
