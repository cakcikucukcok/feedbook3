  <title>Framley Parsonage: The Chronicles of Barsetshire - Anthony Trollope, Katherine Mullin, Francis O&#39;Gorman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;The fact is, Mark, that you and I cannot conceive the depth of fraud in such a man as that.&#39;
The Reverend Mark Robarts makes a mistake.  Drawn into a social set at odds with his clerical responsibilities, he guarantees the debts of an unscrupulous Member of Parliament. He stands to lose his reputation, and his family, future, and home are all in peril.  His patroness, the proud and demanding Lady Lufton, is offended and the romantic hopes of Mark&#39;s sister Lucy, courted by Lady Lufton&#39;s son, are in jeopardy.  Pride and ambition are set against love and integrity in a novel that has
remained one of Trollope&#39;s most popular stories.
Set against ecclesiastical events in the Barchester diocese and informed by British political instability after the Crimean War, Trollope&#39;s fourth Barchester novel was his first major success.  A compelling history of uncertain futures, Framley Parsonage is a vivid exploration of emotional and geographical displacement that grew out of Trollope&#39;s own experiences as he returned to England  from Ireland in 1859.

Each affordable volume reflects Oxford&#39;s commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more." />
