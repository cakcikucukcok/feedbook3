  <title>THE MAGIC FISHBONE - an illustrated children&#39;s book by Charles Dickens - Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There was once a King, and he had a Queen; and he was the manliest of his sex, and she was the loveliest of hers. The King was, in his private profession, Under Government. The Queen&amp;rsquo;s father had been a medical man out of town. They had nineteen children, and were always having more. Seventeen of these children took care of the baby; and Alicia, the eldest, took care of them all. Their ages varied from seven years to seven months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day the King was going to the office, when he stopped at the fishmonger&amp;rsquo;s to buy a pound and a half of salmon not too near the tail, which the Queen &amp;nbsp;had requested him to send home. Mr Pickles, the fishmonger, said, &amp;ldquo;Certainly, sir, is there any other article, Good-morning.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But what of the old lady in the shop? The King hadn&amp;rsquo;t noticed her and she is VERY important to this story for she is the Good Fairy Grandmarina. But just how important you ask? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ll just have to download and read this story and find out for yourselves!&lt;br /&gt;
