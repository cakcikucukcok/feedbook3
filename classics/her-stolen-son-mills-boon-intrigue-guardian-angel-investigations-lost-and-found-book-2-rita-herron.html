  <title>Her Stolen Son (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Guardian Angel Investigations: Lost and Found, Book 2) - Rita Herron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A little boy hired a brooding detective to bring his mother home…and then the child disappeared&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Detective Colt Mason&#39;s latest &quot;client&quot; was impossible to resist. Not only was he just five years old, his teary-eyed pleas to prove his mother was innocent of murder pulled at Colt&#39;s hard to reach heartstrings. But before he could investigate, the child disappeared without a trace. Now, with Serena Stover desperate to find her son and clear her name, Colt took one look at the beautiful widow and knew this little family would change his life forever. As the search intensified, Colt unearthed a far-reaching–and deadly–conspiracy, making him more determined than ever to solve this case and keep his promise that Serena&#39;s smile would return when she was reunited with her little boy.&lt;/p&gt;
