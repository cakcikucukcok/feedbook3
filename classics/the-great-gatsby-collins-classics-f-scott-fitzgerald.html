  <title>The Great Gatsby (Collins Classics) - F. Scott Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Considered one of the all-time great American works of fiction, Fitzgerald’s glorious yet ultimately tragic social satire on the Jazz Age encapsulates the exuberance, energy and decadence of an era.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After the war, the mysterious Jay Gatsby, a self-made millionaire pursues wealth, riches and the lady he lost to another man with stoic determination. He buys a mansion across from her house and throws lavish parties to try and entice her. When Gatsby finally does reunite with Daisy Buchanan, tragic events are set in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Told through the eyes of his detached and omnipresent neighbour and friend, Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald’s succinct and powerful prose hints at the destruction and tragedy that awaits.&lt;/p&gt;

Interestingly, the book did not sell very well during Fitzgerald’s lifetime, and when he died in 1940 he seemed to have regarded the book as a failure. When he died, scholars started to assess his work, and The Great Gatsby was recognized as an important work of literature.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: The Great Gatsby (Collins Classics ...</i></b> | The Great Gatsby was hailed as the greatest novel ever written and F. Scott Fitzgerald quite rightly earned his place as the finest writer of his or any other generation.

Scott Fitzgerald announced his decision to write "something new--something extraordinary and beautiful and simple + intricately patterned." That extraordinary, beautiful, intricately patterned, and above all, simple novel became The Great Gatsby , arguably Fitzgerald's finest work and certainly the book for which he is best known.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Great Gatsby (Collins Classics) - F.
