  <title>In His Hands - A.J. Cork</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In His Hands draws from the wellspring of the Bibles rich traditions and brings to life, in a collection of short stories, key figures whose lives God touched with His grace. The stories begin with Adam, the father of all people, and end with Mary, the mother of the Lord of all people. In between, stories reveal the depths of the hearts of the Old Testaments patriarchs and matriarchs and the New Testaments disciples of Jesus and participants in His Passion.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these short stories, A.J. Cork finds in biblical characters, who may seem unapproachable or almost immovably iconic, like figures carved in a great frieze, the little touches of the ordinary that help readers to see in them the common humanity shared across the millennia. Some of the stories begin with brief introductory passages that set the scenes. Others leap right into the lives of the characters, animating their stories with vivid descriptions, revealing dialogue, and finely sketched details of locales and events.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you are familiar with the Bibles characters from reading the Scriptures or you have always wondered about Noah and Abraham, Moses and Rahab, Mary and Peter, and Nicodemus and Barabbas, In His Hands will offer you entertainment and education. This collection will help you to encounter the figures whose lives grace the pages of the Bible and whose memories touch the hearts of everyone who hears how God has worked in and through them to show His glory.&lt;/p&gt;" />
