  <title>The Professor (Centaur Classics) - Charlotte Brontë</title>
      <meta name="description" content="«The Professor» is Charlotte Brontës first novel, in which she audaciously inhabits the voice and consciousness of a man, William Crimsworth. Like Jane Eyre he is parentless; like Lucy Snowe in «Villette», he leaves the certainties of England to forge a life in Brussels. But as a man, William has freedom of action, and as a writer Brontë is correspondingly liberated, exploring the relationship between power and sexual desire.
William&#39;s first person narration reveals his attraction to the dominating directress of the girls&#39; school where he teaches, played out in the school&#39;s &#39;secret garden&#39;. Balanced against this is his more temperate relationship with one of his pupils, Frances Henri, in which mastery and submission interplay. «The Professor» was published only after Charlotte Brontës death; today it gives us a fascinating insight into the first stirrings of her supreme creative imagination." />

I enjoyed this book a great deal! I think more classes need to pick up this book. There was a lot of criticism on it due to the fact it was a female writing from a male perspective.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Professor (Centaur Classics) - Charlotte Brontë</a> </h3></p><hr/>
