        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;FBI profiler Sam Connelly had come to Daniella Butler&#39;s remote Louisiana bed-and-breakfast to escape the consuming horrors of his job - and the dark demons he fears lurk in his own soul. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But finding a dead body on her property changes everything. There&#39;s no room in his life - in his heart - for a family. Or so he thinks, until a killer&#39;s threat places his irresistible innkeeper and her young daughter under his protection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, as the obsessed psychopath inches closer to possessing Daniella, Sam must call upon his elite skills to track his target and keep the beautiful blonde and her child safe. Defending them becomes his greatest challenge. Losing them is not even an option.&lt;/p&gt;
