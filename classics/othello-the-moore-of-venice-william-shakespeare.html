  <title>Othello, the Moore of Venice - William Shakespeare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Othello, the Moore of Venice is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, written in 1603. Also known as &amp;quot;The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Powerful drama from a marriage between the exotic Moor Othello and the Venetian lady Desdemona that begins with elopement and mutual devotion and ends with jealous rage and death. Shakespeare builds many differences into his hero and heroine, including race, age, and cultural background. Yet most readers and audiences believe the couple&amp;#39;s strong love would overcome these differences were it not for Iago, who sets out to destroy Othello. Iago&amp;#39;s false insinuations about Desdemona&amp;#39;s infidelity draw Othello into his schemes, and Desdemona is subjected to Othello&amp;#39;s horrifying verbal and physical assaults.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his beloved wife, Desdemona; his loyal lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted but ultimately unfaithful ensign, Iago. Given its varied and enduring themes of racism, love, jealousy, betrayal, revenge and repentance, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theatre alike, and has been the source for numerous operatic, film, and literary adaptations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&amp;#39;s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England&amp;#39;s national poet, and the &amp;quot;Bard of Avon&amp;quot;. His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright." />
