  <title>My Carpet of the Rainbows - Shrini Pal Zaheer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Carpet of the Rainbows is a lyrically narrated classic family saga replete with its own share of trials and tribulations, aspirations and achievements. It is a tale of three women of three generations; Lucie, Eva and Rosana and their boundless quest for elusive love and home, which is unique as well as universal. 
A wide range of well fleshed-out characters, from an American singer or a Portuguese soldier to a rustic, homeless Indian child-labour or a coin-eyed businessman, illuminates the stage. Even the time and space take part as characters. Golden Goa, dreamy Darjeeling, serene Shantiniketan and history of colonialism are intricately woven in the texture of the story.
Travelling through a labyrinth of human emotions this charming novel unfurls the whole spectrum of human relationships and unravels the mystery of human characters, behaviours and definitely leaves a deep impact on the readers. 
Written with an astoundingly easy flow, the words waltz across the pages in a mesmerising style. There are sweet, smiling similes, metaphors, and sour, pungent pun or alliterations on every page. The narrating style of rewind and fast forward in Book 3 is quite unique. Soft shadows of lyrics and bright sparkles of one-liners (I was by his side, like the pause following a word. Notes make notables.) make the reading an enjoyable, unforgettable experience." />
