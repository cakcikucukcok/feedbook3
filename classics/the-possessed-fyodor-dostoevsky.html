  <title>The Possessed - Fyodor Dostoevsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Possessed is an 1872 novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky. Although titled The Possessed in the initial English translation, Dostoyevsky scholars and later translations favour the titles The Devils or Demons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
An extremely political book, Demons is a testimonial of life in Imperial Russia in the late 19th century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the revolutionary democrats begin to rise in Russia, different ideologies begin to collide. Dostoyevsky casts a critical eye on both the radical idealists, portraying their ideas and ideological foundation as demonic, and the conservative establishment&amp;#39;s ineptitude in dealing with those ideas and their social consequences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This form of intellectual conservativism tied to the Slavophile movement of Dostoyevsky&amp;#39;s day, called Pochvennichestvo, is seen to have continued on into its modern manifestation in individuals like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dostoyevsky&amp;#39;s novels focus on the idea that utopias and positivist ideas, in being utilitarian, were unrealistic and unobtainable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book has five primary characters representing different ideologies. By exploring their differing philosophies, Dostoyevsky describes the political chaos seen in 19th century Russia." />

Dostoyevsky's writing gives the book the Russian splash of vodka, servicemen and corrupt officialdom.<br /><b><i>The Possessed: Dostoevsky, Fyodor: 9780394604411: Amazon ...</i></b> | The Possessed, novel by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, published in Russian in 1872 as Besy. The book, also known in English as The Devils and The Demons , is a reflection of Dostoyevsky’s belief that revolutionists possessed the soul of Russia and that, unless exorcised by a renewed faith in Orthodox Christianity and a pure nationalism , they would drive his country over the precipice .<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Possessed - Fyodor Dostoevsky</a> </h3></p><hr/>
