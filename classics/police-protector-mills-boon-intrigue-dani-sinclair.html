          &lt;strong&gt;Finding three children locked in a saferoom wasn&#39;t how Lucan O&#39;Shay planned to spend the holidays. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking the children and their feisty aunt into his home…well, if that&#39;s what it took to serve and protect, that&#39;s what he would do. Never mind that the aunt, Kyra Wolfstead, was making him crazy. But someone was trying to kill her and take the children. Not on Lucan&#39;s watch.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It would take all of Lucan&#39;s expertise and self-control to give Kyra and the kids a safe Christmas under his own personal house arrest. But what scared this tough Irish cop the most was his growing hope that this sentence was for life….&lt;/p&gt;
