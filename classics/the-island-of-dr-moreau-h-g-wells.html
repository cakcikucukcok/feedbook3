  <title>The Island of Dr. Moreau - H.G. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Island of Dr. Moreau is a science fiction novel, by English author, H. G. Wells.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The text of the novel is the narration of Edward Prendick, a shipwrecked man rescued by a passing boat who is left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. The novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature. Wells described the novel as &amp;quot;an exercise in youthful blasphemy&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Island of Doctor Moreau is a classic of early science fiction and remains one of Wells&amp;#39;s best-known books. It has been adapted to film and other media on many occasions. The Island of Doctor Moreau is the account of Edward Prendick, an Englishman with a scientific education who survives a shipwreck in the southern Pacific Ocean. A passing ship takes him aboard, and a man named Montgomery revives him. Prendick also meets a grotesque bestial native named M&amp;#39;ling, who appears to be Montgomery&amp;#39;s manservant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The ship is transporting a number of animals which belong to Montgomery. As they approach the island, Montgomery&amp;#39;s destination, the captain demands Prendick leave the ship with Montgomery. Montgomery explains that he will not be able to host Prendick on the island. Despite this, the captain leaves Prendick in a dinghy and sails away. Seeing that the captain has abandoned Prendick, Montgomery takes pity and rescues him. As ships rarely pass the island, Prendick will be housed in an outer room of an enclosed compound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The island belongs to Dr. Moreau. Prendick remembers that he has heard of Moreau, formerly an eminent physiologist in London whose gruesome experiments in vivisection had been publicly exposed and has fled England as a result of his exposure.&amp;nbsp;" />
