      <meta name="description" content="The Vili from the east had again swooped down on the Sutar village in the Northlands, had taken provisions, burned homes scattered the great sacred fire in the long house, and even killed some of those that did not run fast enough and hide. The special Vasir bowl was also taken away as well as defiling the royal fire by seawater and bodily fluids. Agni the fire master and Loki his betrothed set out on a quest to retrieve the Vasir bowl and locate the Vili tribes treasure trove of stolen Sutar wealth. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Agni and Loki with the intelligent and faithful dog, TYR, finally after many turns and trials found what they were looking for and more. With the doubtful help of a gnome named Garr, the Sutar seekers have success within their grasp.&lt;br&gt;

Will they fulfill their destiny? Will they find happiness and marry?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Will they become leaders of their clan?&lt;br&gt;
