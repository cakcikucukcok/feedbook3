  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Ball and the Cross - G.K. Chesterton</i></b> | Like much of G. K. Chesterton's fiction, The Ball and the Cross is both witty and profound, cloaking serious religious and philosophical inquiry in sparkling humor and whimsy. Serialized in the British publication The Commonwealth in 1905-06, Chesterton's second novel first appeared in book form in America in 1909, delighting and challenging readers with its heady mixture of fantasy, farce, and theology.<br /><b><i>The Ball and the Cross: Chesterton, G. K.: 9780486288055 ...</i></b> | The Ball and the Cross, a novel, by G. K. Chesterton. The title is making a reference to a more worldly and rationalist world-view, represented by a ball or sphere, and the cross representing Christianity.<br /><b><i>The Ball and The Cross: Chesterton, G K: 9781517757441 ...</i></b> | G. K. Chesterton's _The Ball and the Cross_ (1910) was his second novel. [His first was _The Napoleon of Notting Hill_ (1904)]. While it was not published in book form until after his masterpiece, _The Man Who Was Thursday_ (1908), the magazine serial preceeded _Thursday_ (_Commonwealth_ 1905-1906).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Ball and the Cross - G.K.
