  <title>The Complete Henry Iv, Part One - Donald J. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Henry IV, Part One is a rich play:  rich in drama and intrigue, political machinations, and comedy.  Not only does Prince Harry (Hal) redeem himself in his fathers eyes, he also satisfies audience expectations.  One important sub-plot running throughout the play is the questionable ascension of Henry IV to the throne.  Additionally, one cannot ignore the comparison between Prince Harry and  Hotspur (Harry Monmouth).  
Finally there is the dominant character of Falstaff, larger than  a life portrait  which no artist could possibly capture.  One might cavil at Falstaffs disregard for truth, for his penchant for lying, for his pusillanimity which approaches and even encompasses true cowardice.  Yet even acknowledging the truth of these charges, over the centuries audiences have taken Falstaff to their hearts, perhaps seeing him as an avatar of weaknesses they, too, possess.  Thus, despite (maybe because of) his personal flaws, audiences have accepted Falstaff  without reservation, sharing his misadventures and laughing at his peccadillos, allowing Falstaff to endure as one of Shakespeares titanic creations, truly a man for all seasons." />
