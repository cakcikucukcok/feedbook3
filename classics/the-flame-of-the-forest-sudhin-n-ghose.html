  <title>The Flame of the Forest - Sudhin N. Ghose</title>

He cannot secure a job despite having completed his education with flying colours. Unwilling to steady his drifting, his lover has abandoned him. And, increasingly put off by the clamour for &amp;lsquo;progress&amp;rsquo; among the newly liberated city-folk around him, all of whom are quick to dismiss tradition, he finds himself drawn to Myna, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;kirtani&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;who believes she is a handmaiden to Radha, Lord Krishna&amp;rsquo;s consort.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his attempts to make a living, he writes frivolous articles for an American magazine and acts as a part-time secretary to his mentor, the Diwan, a political moderate with waning influence. But when Ek Nambur, a demagogue and Diwan&amp;rsquo;s political rival, puts the latter under house arrest and comes after the young man, he is forced to make a choice. He can stay on to fight a losing battle or take up Myna&amp;rsquo;s invitation to join her and become a fellow pilgrim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sumptuous tapestry of myth, history and legend,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Flame of the Forest&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is the story of a young adult forced to choose between tradition and modernity, and take up the responsibility of moulding his own life.
