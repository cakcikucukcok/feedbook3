At the Earth's Core is a 1914 fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the first in his series about the fictional " hollow earth " land of Pellucidar. It first appeared as a four-part serial in All-Story Weekly from April 4–25, 1914.<br /><b><i>At the Earth's Core (novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | “At The Earth’s Core,” first published in 1914, is one of Edgar Rice Burrough’s most imaginative works. It is the first of seven books in the Pellucidar series and imagines a world inside the earth (five hundred miles beneath the surface) where the most advanced species is reptilian and the humans are still living in the stone age.<br /><b><i>At the Earth's Core: Burroughs, Edgar Rice: 9781978295926 ...</i></b> | In their graphic novel 'At The Earth's Core', Bobby Nash and Jamie Chase have channelled Edgar Rice Burroughs perfectly. In true Burroughs tradition there is not a moment's let up. Right from the word go, Bobby Nash's script pares the original novel down to a series of incidents that seem neither rushed nor forced.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>At the Earth&#39;s Core - Edgar Rice Burroughs</a> </h3></p><hr/>
