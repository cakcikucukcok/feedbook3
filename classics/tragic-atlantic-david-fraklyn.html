  <title>Tragic Atlantic - David Fraklyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of a boy who was left with a slave trader on the Grain Coast of West Africa as a guarantee by his stepfather. If his stepfather does not supply the slave trader with the captives, he owes him, and the boy will be sold across the Atlantic to be enslaved. In telling the story, the author was inspired by accounts given by sailors and others who witnessed firsthand the operation of the Atlantic slave trade. 
The author reconstructs the anguish of the victims of the slave trade and the destruction caused to settlements and civilization of West Africa by the raids and warfare. He also explores the meaning of our common humanity and the importance of forgiveness and remorse. 
The story is set in the recent past, but it has relevance for today, especially as it relates to modern slavery." />
