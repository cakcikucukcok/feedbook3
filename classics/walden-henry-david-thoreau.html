  <title>Walden - Henry David Thoreau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Walden is a book by noted transcendentalist Henry David Thoreau.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The text is a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings. The work is part personal declaration of independence, social experiment, voyage of spiritual discovery, satire, and (to some degree) manual for self-reliance. First published in 1854, Walden details Thoreau&amp;#39;s experiences over the course of two years, two months, and two days in a cabin he built near Walden Pond, amidst woodland owned by his friend and mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, near Concord, Massachusetts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thoreau used this time to write his first book, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. The experience later inspired Walden, in which Thoreau compresses the time into a single calendar year and uses passages of four seasons to symbolize human development. By immersing himself in nature, Thoreau hoped to gain a more objective understanding of society through personal introspection. Simple living and self-sufficiency were Thoreau&amp;#39;s other goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy, a central theme of the American Romantic Period." />

[citation needed] Thoreau spent nearly four times as long on the Walden manuscript as he actually spent at the cabin. Upon leaving Walden Pond and at Emerson's request, Thoreau returned to Emerson's house and spent the majority of his time paying debts.<br /><b><i>Walden - Wikipedia</i></b> | Henry David Thoreau (1817â€“1862) (properly pronounced Thaw-roe) was an American author, poet, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist.<br /><b><i>Walden: Thoreau, Henry David: 9781494812508: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | Walden is the product of the two years and two months Thoreau lived in semi-isolation by Walden Pond near Concord, Massachusetts.
