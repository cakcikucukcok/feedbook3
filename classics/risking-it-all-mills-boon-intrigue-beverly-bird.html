          &lt;strong&gt;This was the case that could make or break Grace Simkanian&#39;s career as a defense attorney, but her client, Aidan McKenna, wasn&#39;t making it easy for her.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The charming cop enjoyed provoking and challenging her - inspiring emotions that were anything but professional. Grace was determined to win this case, but would she lose her heart in the process? Framed for extortion and set on proving his innocence, Aidan was forced to depend on the sleek, sophisticated Grace to help him find out who was behind the frame-up.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His lady lawyer was pure temptation, and he yearned to set her cool demeanor on fire. But would putting his trust in Grace ultimately be Aidan&#39;s downfall?&lt;/p&gt;
