      <meta name="description" content="Most people think of The Call of the Wild or White Fang when Jack London&#39;s name comes up -- and rightfully so, for these are his two most famous works, and both are classics.

Almost 900 pages of great reading!&lt;P&gt; Included are:&lt;P&gt; THE REJUVENATION OF MAJOR RATHBONE&lt;BR&gt; THE MAN WITH THE GASH&lt;BR&gt; A RELIC OF THE PLIOCENE&lt;BR&gt; THE SHADOW AND THE FLASH&lt;BR&gt; PLANCHETTE&lt;BR&gt; BEFORE ADAM&lt;BR&gt; THE IRON HEEL&lt;BR&gt; A CURIOUS FRAGMENT&lt;BR&gt; GOLIAH&lt;BR&gt; THE SCARLET PLAGUE&lt;BR&gt; WHEN THE WORLD WAS YOUNG&lt;BR&gt; THE UNPARALLELED INVASION&lt;BR&gt; THE STRENGTH OF THE STRONG&lt;BR&gt; THE STAR-ROVER&lt;BR&gt; THE RED ONE&lt;P&gt; And if you enjoy this volume, don&#39;t forget to search your favorite ebook store for &quot;Wildside Press Megapack&quot; to see all the other entries in this great series, covering science fiction, fantasy, horror, mysteries, westerns, classics -- and much, much more!" />
