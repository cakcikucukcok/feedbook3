          &lt;strong&gt;Secret royal in search of a Cinderella… &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was cold, they were trapped, and Rory Buchanan had made love to a perfect stranger. She’d also enjoyed it far more than she should have. But how was a regular girl from Whitehorse, Montana supposed to know the royal protocol for dealing with a fantasy one-night stand?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Even if he didn’t remember their night together, it soon became clear that gorgeous Devlin would do anything for Rory. But this relationship was no fairy tale. Because someone was willing to kill to keep Devlin’s secret past from toppling a royal hierarchy. And with Rory pregnant with his surprise heir, her life was at stake as well!&lt;/p&gt;
