  <title>The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing-World - Margaret Cavendish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Description of a New World, Called The Blazing-World, better known as The Blazing World, is a 1666 work of prose fiction by English writer Margaret Cavendish, the Duchess of Newcastle. It has been described as an early forerunner of Science Fiction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As its full title suggests, Blazing World is a fanciful depiction of a satirical, utopian kingdom in another world (with different stars in the sky) that can be reached via the North Pole. It is &amp;quot;the only known work of utopian fiction by a woman in the 17th century, as well as one of the earliest examples of what we now call &amp;#39;science fiction&amp;#39; &amp;mdash; although it is also a romance, an adventure story, and even autobiography.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A young woman enters this other world, becomes the empress of a society composed of various species of talking animals, and organizes an invasion back into her world complete with submarines towed by the &amp;quot;fish men&amp;quot; and the dropping of &amp;quot;fire stones&amp;quot; by the &amp;quot;bird men&amp;quot; to confound the enemies of her homeland, the Kingdom of Esfi." />
