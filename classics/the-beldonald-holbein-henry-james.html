  <title>The Beldonald Holbein -  Henry James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Henry James&lt;/b&gt;,&amp;nbsp;OM&amp;nbsp;(15 April 1843 &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;28 February 1916) was an American author regarded as a key transitional figure between&amp;nbsp;literary realism&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;literary modernism, and is considered by many to be among the greatest novelists in the English language. He was the son of&amp;nbsp;Henry James, Sr.&amp;nbsp;and the brother of renowned philosopher and psychologist&amp;nbsp;William James&amp;nbsp;and diarist&amp;nbsp;Alice James.&lt;br /&gt;
He is best known for a number of novels dealing with the social and marital interplay between emigre Americans, English people, and continental Europeans &amp;ndash; examples of such novels include&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Portrait of a Lady&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Ambassadors&lt;/i&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Wings of the Dove&lt;/i&gt;. His later works were increasingly experimental. In describing the internal states of mind and social dynamics of his characters, James often made use of a personal style in which ambiguous or contradictory motivations and impressions were overlaid or closely juxtaposed in the discussion of a single character&amp;#39;s psyche. For their unique ambiguity, as well as for other aspects of their composition, his late works have been compared to&amp;nbsp;impressionist painting.&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to voluminous works of fiction, James published articles and books of criticism,&amp;nbsp;travel, biography, autobiography, and plays. Born in the United States, James largely relocated to Europe as a young man and eventually settled in England, becoming a&amp;nbsp;British subject&amp;nbsp;in 1915, one year before his death. James was nominated for the&amp;nbsp;Nobel Prize in Literature&amp;nbsp;in 1911, 1912, and 1916.[" />
