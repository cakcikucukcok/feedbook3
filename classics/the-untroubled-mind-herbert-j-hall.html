  <title>The Untroubled Mind - Herbert J. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The place of God in healing. Expressed in the most elegant language. “I know of no bodily ill or handicap which we may not eventually rise above and beyond by means of brave spiritual progress.” The state of mind plays a vital role in one&#39;s health and happiness. Many troubles in life stem from one&#39;s untrained, undisciplined mind causing mental unrest and worry. One remedy is to know life in its farther reaches and better applications and to obtain an untroubled mind through spiritual hygiene and growth. With an untroubled mind, one can smoothly cope with the life&#39;s ups and downs, fears and regrets. This book discusses the importance and the guidance of having an untroubled mind, including mind practice and cultivation by faith, prayer, self-control, rest, lighter touch, and virtues. How are we to live the larger life? Partly through uninspired struggle and through the brave meeting of adversity, but partly, also, in a way that may be described as out of hand, by intuition, by exercise of the quality of mind. &quot;A very wise physician has said that “every illness has two parts—what it is, and what the patient thinks about it.” What the patient thinks about it is often more important and more troublesome than the real disease. What the patient thinks of life, what life means to him is also of great importance and may be the bar that shuts out all real health and happiness.  The following pages are devoted to certain ideals of life which I would like to give to my patients, the long-time patients who have especially fallen to my lot.&quot;
