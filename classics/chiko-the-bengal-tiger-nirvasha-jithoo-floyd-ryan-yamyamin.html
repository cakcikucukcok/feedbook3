  <title>Chiko-The Bengal Tiger - Nirvasha Jithoo, Floyd Ryan Yamyamin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chiko-The Bengal Tiger is a fiction picture story book to raise the awareness of the poaching of tigers and wildlife protection of endangered species to children. Poaching of tigers involves the capture and killing of vulnerable tigers and this illegal act is a major threat to the &#39;Bengal Tiger&#39; which constitutes over 75% of the tiger population in its entirety found mainly in Bangladesh, India, Bhutan and Burma. Human beings are the tiger&#39;s top most predator for popular games with trophies and to hold a prestigious status title in some societies. Tigers are brutally killed for traditional East Asian medicine for a range of purposes with no scientific findings to prove that these are really beneficial. Also, the selling of the tiger&#39;s fur on the black market with very high profitable gains to a seller is an international concern. 
This book is an essential read for children to feel the connection of the dramatic tension about the illegal act of poaching and how we as humans should show remorse and responsibility for the protection of wildlife to live a complete life on the planet. Chiko-The Bengal Tiger is a touching bedtime story to be read by parents to their children. The book is also an essential educational tool for teachers to use as part of guided reading, creative classroom group discussions on the theme of poaching and humane character behaviour to protect wildlife on our planet." />
