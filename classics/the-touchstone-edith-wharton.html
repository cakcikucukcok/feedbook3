  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>The Touchstone - Edith Wharton</i></b> | The Touchstone is a novella, written by Edith Wharton in 1900; it was the first of her many stories describing life in old New York. Stephen Glennard, the novella's protagonist, is suddenly impoverished and unable to marry the woman he loves. He sells the private letters a former admirer had written to him, before she had become a famous author.<br /><b><i>The Touchstone - Wikipedia</i></b> | The story of a young man who scorns the love of a tortured novelist, only to have her words come back to haunt him from the dead, The Touchstone shows off the skills Wharton became famous for in novels such as Ethan Frome and House of Mirth, particularly her piercing and delicious talent for satiric observation.<br /><b><i>The Touchstone by Edith Wharton - Goodreads</i></b> | "The Touchstone" is Edith Wharton's second book and it was published in 1900. It was also published under the title "A Gift From The Grave". Her previous literary effort was a collection of short stories titled "The Greater Inclination" and this is a longer story, roughly what we would today call a novella.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Touchstone - Edith Wharton</a> </h3></p><hr/>
