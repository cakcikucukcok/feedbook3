  <title>A Young Man in a Hurry - Robert W. Chambers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Renowned author Robert W. Chambers dabbled in virtually every literary style under the sun, garnering acclaim from top writers and critics along the way. The story collection A Young Man in a Hurry brings together some of Chambers&amp;#39; most engrossing shorter pieces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert William Chambers (May 26, 1865 &amp;ndash; December 16, 1933) was an American artist and fiction writer, best known for his book of short stories entitled The King in Yellow, published in 1895.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was born in Brooklyn, New York, to William P. Chambers (1827&amp;ndash;1911), a corporate and bankruptcy lawyer, and Caroline Smith Boughton (1842-1913). His parents met when Caroline was twelve years old and William P. was interning with her father, Joseph Boughton, a prominent corporate lawyer. Eventually the two formed the law firm of Chambers and Boughton which continued to prosper even after Joseph&amp;#39;s death in 1861. Robert&amp;#39;s great-grandfather, William Chambers (birth unknown), a lieutenant in the British Royal Navy, was married to Amelia Saunders (1765-1822), the great grand daughter of Tobias Saunders, of Westerly, Rhode Island. The couple moved from Westerly, to Greenfield, Massachusetts and then to Galway, New York, where their son, also William Chamber (1798-1874), was born. The second William graduated from Union College at the age of 18, and then went to a college in Boston, where he studied to be a doctor. Upon graduating, he and his wife, Eliza P. Allen (1793-1880), a direct descendant of Roger Williams, the founder of Providence, Rhode Island were among the first settlers of Broadalbin, New York. His brother was architect Walter Boughton Chambers." />
