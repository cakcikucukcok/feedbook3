  <title>The Shakespeare Conspiracy - Ted Bacino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="TWO QUESTIONS HAVE ALWAYS PLAGUED HISTORIANS:
HOW COULD Christopher Marlowe, a known spy and England&#39;s foremost playwright, be suspiciously murdered and quickly buried in an unmarked grave  just days before he was to be tried for treason?
HOW COULD William Shakespeare replace Marlowe as England&#39;s greatest playwright virtually overnight  when Shakespeare had never written anything before and was merely an unknown actor?  Historians have noted that the Bard of Stratford was better known at that time for holding horses for the gentry while they watched plays.
The Shakespeare Conspiracy is a historical novel that intertwines the two mysteries and then puts the pieces together to offer the only possible resolution.  The novel, a wild romp through gay 16th Century Elizabethan England, is a rapidly unfolding detective story filled with comedy, intrigue, murder and illicit love.  And most importantly, all recorded events, persons, dates and documents are historically accurate.  You will
Get the scandalous view of the real William Shakespeare, with his sexual peccadilloes, illegitimate children and mistresses
Wander through the gay world of Christopher Marlowe, when it was acceptable to be homosexual just so long as one stayed within one&#39;s own class  as did Kings like James I, Edward II, and others
Observe Inspector Henry Maunder matching wits with Christopher Marlowe&#39;s patron, Sir Thomas Walsingham  one cleverly hiding the facts and other cunningly discovering the truth
Watch the arguments unfold, showing the actual reasons that many historians believe that it could only have been Christopher Marlowe writing all those great works.
It&#39;s a tale of murder, mayhem and manhunts in the underbelly of London as the Black Plague scourges the country and the greatest conspiracy plot of all time is hatched.  It&#39;s
