  <title>The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen - Rudolph Erich Raspe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a literary gem that has inspired many for years, and a must for any book collection. Allow yourself to be transported to other worlds and take part in one of the greatest tales ever told.&lt;br /&gt;
Baron Munchausen was a real German adventurer known for his fondness for tall tales and exaggeration. But the exploits that Rudolf Erich Raspe attributed to him in his book quite clearly drew on folklore and on Raspe&amp;#39;s own whimsical inventiveness. The Baron&amp;#39;s escapades include a balloon expedition to visit the King of the Moon, an encounter with the goddess Venus, a battle with the Turkish army, and an enormous sea creature who swallows him up in the South Seas.&lt;/p&gt;" />
