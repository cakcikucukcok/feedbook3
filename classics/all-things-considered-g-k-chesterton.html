  <title>All Things Considered - G.K. Chesterton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A collection of essays dealing with various topics, such as human nature, current affairs, science and religion. Includes; The Case For The Ephemeral; Cockneys And Their Jokes; The Fallacy Of Success; Conceit And Caricature; Patriotism And Sport; The Zola Controversy; Thoughts Around Koepenick; Woman; The Worship Of The Wealthy; The Error Of Impartiality; A Dead Poet; On The Cryptic And The Elliptic, and more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
G.K. Chesterton (29 May 1874 &amp;ndash; 14 June 1936), was an English writer, poet, philosopher, dramatist, journalist, orator, lay theologian, biographer, and literary and art critic. Chesterton is often referred to as the &amp;quot;prince of paradox&amp;quot;. Time magazine has observed of his writing style: &amp;quot;Whenever possible Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories&amp;mdash;first carefully turning them inside out.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chesterton is well known for his fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and for his reasoned apologetics. Even some of those who disagree with him have recognised the wide appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man. Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an &amp;quot;orthodox&amp;quot; Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to Catholicism from High Church Anglicanism. George Bernard Shaw, his &amp;quot;friendly enemy&amp;quot;, said of him, &amp;quot;He was a man of colossal genius.&amp;quot; Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, Cardinal John Henry Newman, and John Ruskin." />
