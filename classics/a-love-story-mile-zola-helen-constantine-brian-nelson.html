  <title>A Love Story - Émile Zola, Helen Constantine, Brian Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Everything revolved around their love.  They were constantly bathed in a passion that they carried with them, around them, as though it were the only air they could breathe.&#39;
Hélène Grandjean, an attractive young widow, lives a secluded life in Paris with her only child, Jeanne.  Jeanne is a delicate and nervous girl who jealously guards her mother&#39;s affections.  When Jeanne falls ill, she is attended by Dr Deberle, whose growing admiration for Hélène gradually turns into mutual passion.  Deberle&#39;s wife Juliette, meanwhile, flirts with a shallow admirer, and Hélène, intent on preventing her adultery, precipitates a crisis whose
consequences are far-reaching.  Jeanne realizes she has a rival for Hélène&#39;s devotion in the doctor, and begins to exercise a tyrannous hold over her mother.
The eighth novel in Zola&#39;s celebrated Rougon-Macquart series, A Love Story is an intense psychological and nuanced portrayal of love&#39;s different guises.  Zola&#39;s study extends most notably to the city of Paris itself, whose shifting moods reflect Hélène&#39;s emotional turmoil in passages of extraordinary lyrical description." />
