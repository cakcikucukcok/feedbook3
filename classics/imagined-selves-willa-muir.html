  <title>Imagined Selves - Willa Muir</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume gathers together some of the real and the imagined lives of Willa Muir, one of the finest and fiercest intellectuals of her generation.  Her writing is rich with paradox - although obsessively Scottish in subject and style, she resented Scotland; although a trenchant champion of feminism, she voluntarily sacrificed her identity to that of the &#39;poet&#39;s wife&#39;; and although she was a committed reformer, she never aligned herself with any political or ideological movement. These passionate dichotomies are intertwined in her writing, giving a particular power to her fiction and non-fiction alike. This collection is the first publication to offer a sense of the diversity of Willa Muir&#39;s oeuvre. It makes possible the re-evaluation of her work and assures her of a deserved place in the Scottish literary canon." />
