          &lt;strong&gt;Blake was tracking the Rose Killer in order to forget the woman he couldn&#39;t save.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now there was a new lead: a survivor. Convincing Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Dawson to help was only half the battle. Resisting the allure of the fiery beauty was downright impossible. Sam wanted nothing to do with men. With the city. With the fame of her former life as a model.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six months after the heinous attack, she still bore the killer&#39;s trademark scar. But if she was as tough as she thought, she&#39;d have to face her fears to catch a killer–and dare to love again.&lt;/p&gt;
