  <title>Mark Twain&#39;s Adventures of Tom Sawyer: The Original Text Edition - Alan Gribben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This coming-of-age story captures a vanished world of outdoor action and introduces Mark Twain&#39;s two most enduring literary characters, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. In a novel that Twain termed a &quot;hymn to boyhood,&quot; Tom and Huck fish and swim in the Mississippi River, search for buried treasure, and hide in a haunted house. Tom Sawyer falls for pretty Becky Thatcher, tricks his pals into painting a fence for him, and stages an elaborate prank on the schoolmaster. Around the edges of this idyllic boy-life, however, loom dangerous events in the fictional village of St. Petersburg: Tom and Huck witness a midnight murder in a graveyard, the killer escapes from the courtroom while Tom is testifying, Tom and Becky become lost in a labyrinthine cave, and two sinister villains plot robbery and revenge against a wealthy widow. This Original Text Edition faithfully follows the wording of the first edition, and the editor supplies a historical and literary introduction as well as a guide to Twain&#39;s satirical targets." />
