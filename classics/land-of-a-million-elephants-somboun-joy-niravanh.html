  <title>Land of a Million Elephants - Somboun Joy Niravanh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I would like to share a part of my ancestral culture and history using a story I have written of a beloved elephant. The elephant graces the once-royal flag and is the old symbol of a soon-to-be-forgotten monarchy of the country of Lao. The Southeast Asian wars of the nineteen hundreds were fought by brave souls who were misled by greedy and corrupt men who only wanted to seek absolute power and control and ended the reign of the Lan Xang Kingdom. For seven hundred years, many different ethnicities have settled in this lush jungle paradise. It was never the land of any particular group as many shared its majestic mountains and tropical lowlands, and all called their home the land of a million elephants. Enjoy the story." />
