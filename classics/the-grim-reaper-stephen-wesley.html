  <title>The Grim Reaper - Stephen Wesley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;One bite from a forbidden fruit transforms Adam (from the Garden of Eden) into the Grim Reaper. Stripped of his humanity and consciousness, he is eternally burdened with the task of collecting and delivering all the souls from earth to their afterlife. Unbeknownst to the Grim Reaper, there are higher powers in conflict for where the human souls are to forever exist.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;God had been absent from heaven, creating new worlds and a new species which he created in his image. The angel named Lucifer corrupted with sinister power and feelings of abandonment, challenged God. Lucifer and his small band of rebel angels were exiled from heaven and forced to live in the new realm of hell which has tainted them. Lucifer out of jealousy inflicts God&#39;s new creation with sin, his way of not being forgotten. The ruler of hell discovers a way he can rejoin God in heaven. Every human on earth must perish. But Lucifer is not powerful enough to destroy all the life on the planet himself. Through his sinful manipulation Lucifer plots to unleash Armageddon on earth, and take back his rightful place in heaven.&lt;/P&gt;" />
