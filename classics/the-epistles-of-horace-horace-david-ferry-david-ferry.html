  <title>The Epistles of Horace - Horace, David Ferry, David Ferry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;My aim is to take familiar things and make&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Poetry of them, and do it in such a way&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;That it looks as if it was as easy as could be&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;For anybody to do it . . . the power of making&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;A perfectly wonderful thing out of nothing much&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt;--from &quot;The Art of Poetry&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When David Ferry&#39;s translation of &lt;i&gt;The Odes of Horace&lt;/i&gt; appeared in 1997, Bernard Knox, writing in &lt;i&gt;The New York Review of Books&lt;/i&gt;, called it &quot;a Horace for our times.&quot; In &lt;i&gt;The Epistles of Horace&lt;/i&gt;, Ferry has translated the work in which Horace perfected the conversational verse medium that gives  his voice such dazzling immediacy, speaking in these letters with such  directness, wit, and urgency to young writers, to friends, to his patron  Maecenas, to Emperor Augustus himself. It is the voice of a free man,  talking about how to get along in a Roman world full of temptations,  opportunities, and contingencies, and how to do so with one&#39;s integrity  intact. Horace&#39;s world, so unlike our own and yet so like it, comes to  life in these poems. And there are also the poems--the famous &quot;Art of  Poetry&quot; and others--about the tasks and responsibilities of the  writer: truth to the demands of one&#39;s medium, fearless clear-sighted  self-knowledge, and unillusioned, uncynical realism, joyfully  recognizing the world for what it is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available in ebook for the first time, this English-only edition of &lt;i&gt;The Epistles of Horace&lt;/i&gt; includes Ferry&#39;s translation along with his introduction, notes, and glossary. &quot;Reading these versions we feel as if the streets that Horace walked have opened onto our own&quot; (Peter Campion&lt;i&gt;, Raritan&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />
