  <title>The President (Illustrated) - Alfred Henry Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On this far-away November morning, it being ten by every steeple&lt;br /&gt;
clock and an hour utterly chaste, there could have existed no&lt;br /&gt;
impropriety in one&amp;rsquo;s having had a look into the rooms of Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Richard Storms, said rooms being second-floor front of the&lt;br /&gt;
superfashionable house of Mr. Lorimer Gwynn, Washington, North&lt;br /&gt;
West. Richard, wrapped to the chin in a bathrobe, was sitting much&lt;br /&gt;
at his ease, having just tumbled from the tub. There was ever a recess&lt;br /&gt;
in Richard&amp;rsquo;s morning programme at this point during which his&lt;br /&gt;
breakfast arrived. Pending that repast, he had thrown himself into an&lt;br /&gt;
easy-chair before the blaze which crackled in the deep fireplace. The&lt;br /&gt;
sudden sharp weather made the fire pleasant enough.&lt;br /&gt;
The apartment in which Richard lounged, and the rooms to the rear&lt;br /&gt;
belonging with it, were richly appointed. A fortune had been spilled&lt;br /&gt;
to produce those effects in velvets and plushes and pictures and&lt;br /&gt;
bronzes and crystals and chinas and lamps and Russia leathers and&lt;br /&gt;
laces and brocades and silks, and as you walked the thick rugs you&lt;br /&gt;
made no more noise than a ghost. It was Richard&amp;rsquo;s caprice to have&lt;br /&gt;
his environment the very lap of splendor, being as given to luxury as&lt;br /&gt;
a woman..." />
