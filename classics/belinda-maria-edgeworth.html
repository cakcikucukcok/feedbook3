It was first published in three volumes by Joseph Johnson of London, and was reprinted by Pandora Press in 1986. The novel was Edgeworth's second published, and was considered controversial in its day for its depiction of an interracial marriage.<br /><b><i>Belinda (Edgeworth novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Maria Edgeworth's Belinda is a treat - a twisty plot, some nasty bad hats, male and female, a spoiled marriage renewed, a lost heiress - what more could you ask for?
