  <title>The Permanent Husband - Fyodor Dostoevsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alexei Ivanovich Velchaninov is a land owner who stays in Saint Petersburg for a trial about a piece of land. He receives a visit from Pavel Pavlovich Trusotsky, an old acquaintance who recently became a widower. Velchaninov had an affair with Trusotsky&amp;#39;s wife Natalia, and he realizes that he is the biological father of Liza, Trusotsky&amp;#39;s eight-year-old daughter. Velchaninov, who doesn&amp;#39;t want Liza to be raised by an alcoholic, brings Liza to a foster family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fyodor Mikhaylovich sometimes transliterated Dostoevsky, was a Russian novelist, journalist, and short-story writer whose psychological penetration into the human soul had a profound influence on the 20th century novel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dostoevsky was the second son of a former army doctor. He was educated at home and at a private school. Shortly after the death of his mother in 1837 he was sent to St. Petersburg, where he entered the Army Engineering College. Dostoevsky&amp;#39;s father died in 1839, most likely of apoplexy, but it was rumored that he was murdered by his own serfs. Dostoevsky graduated as a military engineer, but resigned in 1844 to devote himself to writing. His first novel, Poor Folk&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;appeared in 1846.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That year he joined a group of utopian socialists. He was arrested in 1849 and sentenced to death, commuted to imprisonment in Siberia. Dostoevsky spent four years in hard labor and four years as a soldier in Semipalatinsk, a city in what it is today Kazakhstan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dostoevsky returned to St. Petersburg in 1854 as a writer with a religious mission and published three works that derive in different ways from his Siberia experiences: The House of the Dead&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;, (1860) a fictional account of prison life, &lt;i&gt;The Insulted and Injured&lt;/i&gt;, which reflects the author&amp;#39;s refutation of naive Utopianism in the face of evil, and &lt;i&gt;Winter Notes on Summer Impressions&lt;/i&gt;, his account of a trip to Western Europe." />
