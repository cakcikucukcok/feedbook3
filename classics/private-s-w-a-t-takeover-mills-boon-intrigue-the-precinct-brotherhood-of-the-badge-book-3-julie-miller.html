        &lt;p&gt;Liza was nobody special ; until she witnessed a high-profile murder. Only traumatic amnesia kept her from remembering the killer&#39;s identity. Holden Kincaid was KCPD&#39;s number one sharpshooter, and he was desperate for answers regarding his father&#39;s death.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet he was denied access to witness Liza. . . until the security of her whereabouts was compromised. Taking Liza into his very personal custody would definitely keep her safe ; but now devastatingly handsome Holden&#39;s heart is on the line!&lt;/p&gt;
