  <title>Abbeychurch - Charlotte Mary Yonge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most emotional and distressing literary work of Yonge based on women&amp;#39;s fiction. She has portrayed the feelings and sentiments of two teenager girls in a picturesque way and touched the level of modern sensational novel through this gorgeous novel. A Page-turner!&amp;#39;Never think yourself safe because you do your duty in ninety-nine points; it is the hundredth which is to be the ground of your self-denial, which must evidence, or rather instance and realize, your faith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charlotte Mary Yonge (1823&amp;ndash;1901) was an English novelist who wrote to the service of the church. Her books helped to spread the influence of the Oxford Movement. Her abundant work is mostly out of print.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She began writing in 1848, and published during her long life about 160 works, chiefly novels. Her first commercial success, The Heir of Redclyffe (1853), provided the funding to enable the schooner Southern Cross to be put into service on behalf of George Selwyn. Similar charitable works were done with the profits from later novels. Yonge was also a founder and editor for forty years of The Monthly Packet, a magazine (founded in 1851) with a varied readership, but targeted at British Anglican girls (in later years it was addressed to a somewhat wider readership)." />
