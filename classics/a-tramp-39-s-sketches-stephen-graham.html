  <title>A Tramp&#39;s Sketches - Stephen Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the days before air travel, journeys to foreign lands were rather difficult undertakings that were usually reserved for the most stalwart of travelers. This is a major reason why the popularity of the travel writing genre skyrocketed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Stephen Graham was one of the most revered British travel writers during this period, and the essays and short works collected in A Tramp&amp;#39;s Sketches represent an edifying introduction to his uniquely charming style.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stephen Graham (19 March 1884 - 15 March 1975) was a British journalist, travel-writer, essayist and novelist. His best-known books recount his travels around pre-revolutionary Russia and his journey to Jerusalem with a group of Russian Christian pilgrims. Most of his works express his sympathy for the poor, for agricultural labourers and for tramps, and his distaste for industrialisation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Graham was born in Edinburgh, the son of P. Anderson Graham, the essayist and editor of the periodical, Country Life. Shortly after his birth his family moved to Cheltenham. At the age of fourteen Graham left school and worked in London as a clerk in the law courts and the civil service. He began to study Russian under Nicolai Lebedev, with whom he spent a holiday at Lisichansk near the Sea of Azov - an experience which began a lifelong interest in Russia. Shortly after returning to Britain he gave up his job and returned to Russia to hike around the Caucasus and the Urals. Thereafter he supported himself by his journalism and his books. He also taught English in Moscow.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the early 20th century Lord Northcliffe commissioned Graham to write reports from Russia for his newspaper, The Times. Not long after his arrival in Russia he met Rosa Savory, whom he married in Russia in 1909. He was twenty-five; she, forty years old. During World War I Graham found himself in the Altai mountains, from where he sent accounts of the war as seen from a Russian point of view, which were published in The Times and republished as Russia and the World (1915) and Through Russian Central Asia (1916)." />
