  <title>Plain Tales from the Hills - Rudyard Kipling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Plain Tales from the Hills (published 1888) is the first collection of short stories by Rudyard Kipling. Out of its 40 stories, &amp;quot;eight-and-twenty&amp;quot;, according to Kipling&amp;#39;s preface, were initially published in the Civil and Military Gazette in Lahore, Punjab, British India, between November 1886 and June 1887. &amp;quot;The remaining tales are, more or less, new.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Joseph Rudyard Kipling was an English short-story writer, poet, and novelist. He wrote tales and poems of British soldiers in India and stories for children. He was born in Bombay, in the Bombay Presidency of British India, and was taken by his family to England when he was five years old.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kipling&amp;#39;s works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including &amp;quot;The Man Who Would Be King&amp;quot; (1888). His poems include &amp;quot;Mandalay&amp;quot; (1890), &amp;quot;Gunga Din&amp;quot; (1890), &amp;quot;The Gods of the Copybook Headings&amp;quot; (1919), &amp;quot;The White Man&amp;#39;s Burden&amp;quot; (1899), and &amp;quot;If&amp;mdash;&amp;quot; (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children&amp;#39;s books are classics of children&amp;#39;s literature; and one critic described his work as exhibiting &amp;quot;a versatile and luminous narrative gift&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kipling was one of the most popular writers in England, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: &amp;quot;Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius (as distinct from fine intelligence) that I have ever known.&amp;quot; In 1907, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date Among other honours, he was sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, all of which he declined." />
