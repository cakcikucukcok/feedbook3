  <title>The Unbearable Bassington - Saki (H.H. Munro)</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Contrast, written in 1787 by Royall Tyler, is an American play in the tradition of the English Restoration comedies of the seventeenth century; it takes its cue from Sheridan&amp;#39;s The School for Scandal, a British comedy of manners that had revived that tradition a decade before. Royall uses the form to satirize Americans who follow British fashions and indulge in &amp;#39;British vices&amp;#39;. Thus, the play is often concerned with portraying the contrast between European and American culture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Contrast is the first comedy written by an American citizen that was professionally produced. The play is most remembered for its prologue, which evaluates home-made versus foreign goods and ideas, and for the introduction of the Yankee of stock character.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The play begins with the coquettish Charlotte and Letitia talking about the forthcoming marriage and Maria&amp;rsquo;s distress due to her father&amp;rsquo;s marriage plans for her. Billy Dimple&amp;#39;s father was Van Rough&amp;#39;s business partner. Before the death of Dimple&amp;rsquo;s father, a marriage between Van Rough&amp;rsquo;s Daughter, Maria, and Dimple was settled. While Dimple becomes snobbish in England, Maria betakes herself to books that &amp;quot;improve her taste&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;The contrast was so striking betwixt the good sense of her books, and the flimsiness of her love-letters, that she discovered that she had unthinkingly engaged her hand without her heart.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the second scene, Maria bemoans the &amp;quot;helpless situation of [her] sex&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Reputation is the life of a woman - and the only safe asylum a woman of delicacy can find, is in the arms of a man of honor.&amp;quot; Even though Maria reveals to her father a lack of love towards Dimple, old Van Rough still wants her to marry Dimple, stressing that &amp;ldquo;money makes the mare go&amp;rdquo;. For him his daughter&amp;rsquo;s feelings are nonsense and money is the most important thing she should look out for. In a time when women usually were detained from enlightening their opinions by means of literature (biographies were acceptable, but no novels, since they were thought to produce a wrong world view), her father concludes that her sadness comes from &amp;ldquo;these vile books&amp;rdquo;. Not wanting to disappoint her father, Maria consents.&lt;br /&gt;

At first, I thought it had been written in the 1930s. The man was ahead of his time. You could say it's a biography, rather than a novel.
