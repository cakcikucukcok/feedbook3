      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A book you could become obsessed with.&quot; Alastair Braidwood. The death sentence of a spaceman: the claustrophobic editor of a newspaper’s letters page receives a note from a kidnapper informing him that ‘intolerance will not be tolerated’ and that a hostage will be executed unless he arranges for a letter to be published on the front page of the next morning’s paper. So begins the narrator’s tale, within which we encounter strange characters - such as Chris The Crossword Compiler and Mark Twain (or at least, his namesake) - and hear of an enigmatic organisation of moral vigilantes called The Amino. But who is the kidnapper? What are his/her motives? And why would he/she wish to pass a death sentence on the narrator?" />
