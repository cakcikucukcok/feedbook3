          &lt;strong&gt;HE&#39;D DO WHATEVER IT TOOK TO FIND THE KILLER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finding the carjacker who&#39;d killed his wife and child was ex-homicide cop Mick Jacoby&#39;s number one priority. Rumor had it a member of the Robear family was involved, but for five years all leads had gone nowhere. Until a routine auto-theft investigation led Mick to gorgeous Kate Robear.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A repo agent fleeing her family&#39;s dark legacy, Kate&#39;s only crime was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. But the heart-stealing cop in the leather jacket refused to let her out of his sight…especially when the attempts on Kate&#39;s life began. Now, teamed up with Mick to stop a relentless killer, Kate was facing a risk she hadn&#39;t reckoned on: falling passionately, hopelessly in love.&lt;/p&gt;
