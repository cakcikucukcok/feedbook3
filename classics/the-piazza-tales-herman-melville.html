  <title>The Piazza Tales - Herman Melville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Piazza Tales&amp;quot; is a collection of stories by Herman Melville published in 1856. Of the stories contained in the book, five of six had previously appeared in &lt;i&gt;Putnam&amp;rsquo;s Monthly magazine&lt;/i&gt;; only the title story, &amp;ldquo;The Piazza,&amp;rdquo; was original to the book. Melville began writing for Putnam&amp;rsquo;s Monthly when he could not find a publisher for his novel-length work after the critical and commercial failure of his seventh novel &amp;quot;Pierre&amp;quot;. The stories included settings, experiences, and characters drawn from Melville&amp;rsquo;s own life, including his experiences on a whaling vessel, which informed short story &amp;ldquo;The Encantadas&amp;rdquo; as well as Melville&amp;rsquo;s most well-known novel &amp;quot;Moby Dick&amp;quot;. Though critics at the time were not impressed by &amp;quot;The Piazza Tales&amp;quot;, the modern-day rediscovery of Melville as a literary icon brought with it a renewed appreciation for this collection of shorter works.&lt;br /&gt;
