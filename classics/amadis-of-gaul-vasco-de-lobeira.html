  <title>Amadis of Gaul - Vasco De Lobeira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Fans of Arthurian tales will definitely love &amp;quot;Amadis of Gaul&amp;quot;, which is a notable sight among medieval chivalric romances, written by the Portuguese writer Vasco de Lobeira.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Amadis of Gaul&amp;quot; is the story of knight Amadis, who searches for his own identity. Being born in secret, from a forbidden love, he was abandoned but found and raised by a knight. When he reaches maturity, he starts feeling the desire to investigate his origins, so he leaves in a quest for finding more about his identity.&amp;nbsp;But this is not an ordinary quest; it is full of fantastic adventures and characters that are very different than common people: sorcerers, monsters, wild animals, kings and queens, wise men, dwarves, giants and more.&lt;br /&gt;
The action is fast moving - there are pitched battles, combats and tournaments set in exotic places from England to Constantinople, which will certainly entertain all readers. The story has plenty of fantasy and magic - which turns Amadis into the ethos of medieval society (full of adventure non-related to the everyday life) and the embodiment of chivalric virtues: loyalty, justice, humility.&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, and there is also romance between Amadis and Oriana - which is, of course, the main thread of the book&amp;#39;s plot.&amp;quot;Amadis of Gaul&amp;quot; is considered one of the best books of its kind, praised even by Miguel de Cervantes and definitely a significant part of the history of European literature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
