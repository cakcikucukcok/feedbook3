  <title>The Fountain Pen Plus Five - Tathagata Mukhopadhyay, Sirshendu Mukhopadhya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Fountain Pen Plus Five is a bouquet of half a dozen stories with bizarre twists, guaranteed to keep readers glued till the last page has been turned.
Pandit recounts the story of an urchin who sold movie tickets at a premium for a living, or so the world thought, and his passion to help friends even by risking physical abuse. But then, by his own admission, he risked himself every single day.
The Heiress is the tale of a middle aged housewife and her relationship with an old widower, scandalous to few, innocuous to others; was she an angle or a demon?
ORC4851 is the story of a teenager obsessed to learn driving and how he spontaneously uses an opportunity to fulfill his goals and grows up in the process.
The Owl is a dark tale of sexual promiscuity, infidelity, and vendetta.
Brown and Grey is the story of a retired family man getting sucked into the virtual world of cyber sex, threatening to destroy his peace and family.
The Fountain Pen is the outrageous tale of a woman and the mystery behind her eminence in the world of mathematics, her association with a peddler and the vintage fountain pen that forever changed her life." />
