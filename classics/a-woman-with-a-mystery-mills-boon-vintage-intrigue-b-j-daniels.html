        &lt;p&gt;SHE HAD NO MEMORY AND NO PAST&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A year ago Holly Barrows had raced through a raging snowstorm–convinced someone was trying to kill her–into the arms of Slade Rawlins. She&#39;d appeared before him like a beautiful apparition in the dark of night. But she was real, flesh and blood, and his fingers had memorized every curve of her body. Then she&#39;d mysteriously vanished, only to return the following Christmas with an outrageous claim of kidnapping.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;COULD THEY HAVE A FUTURE?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Monsters, she&#39;d said, had taken her baby. But any baby she&#39;d had would also have been Slade&#39;s. And he was consumed by his need to protect Holly and locate their child before the family he desperately wanted was lost…forever.&lt;/p&gt;
