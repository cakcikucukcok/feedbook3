                                                        Revised by John Stark
Jocasta Rex, is a medical doctor. One day she walks into her office and discovers a naked body lying on her examination table. Its the body of a sophomore student, Hector Ramirez Munoz, and the striking feature is a fully erect penis. Jocasta is stunned. Her office is in shambles. While searching around for clues, she is suddenly struck on the head from behind. She falls to the ground unconscious. When she recovers she is surrounded by police investigators, who are incessantly questioning her about the murder of Hector. Jocasta is adamant about taking on her own investigation of the murder so the officers leave. Her quest leads her to Venezuela, where she discovers an underground factory that is distilling a powerful aphrodisiac from a plant called Rubour Vellorum Flapparum or Red Velvet Flapper. Eventually she solves the case, aided by the local police who arrest the farmers growing the plant, and Jocasta becomes recognized as a brilliant scientific investigator, that eliminated a dangerous drug." />
