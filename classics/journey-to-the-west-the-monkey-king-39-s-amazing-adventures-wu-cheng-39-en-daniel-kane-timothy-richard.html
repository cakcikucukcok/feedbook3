      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;China&#39;s most popular traditional novel, &lt;I&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/I&gt; is the thrilling story of the Monkey King and his epic quest, with his trusted companions, to redeem himself.

More than anything else, though, the Monkey King loved mischief and rule&amp;#150;breaking, and was sure he was the most powerful creature in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But after defeat and punishment for his tricks, the Monkey King found himself wanting some things he never expected: to be disciplined and good enough to help the monk Hsuan Zhang on his mission to bring Buddhist Scriptures&amp;#151;and enlightenment&amp;#151;to China.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Readers of all ages will thrill to Timothy Richard&#39;s retelling of the Monkey King&#39;s exploits&amp;#151;whether in the Dragon King&#39;s underwater castle, the Halls of the Dead or the palace of Buddha himself&amp;#151;and find themselves captivated as the Monkey King joins Hsuan Zhang and their companions the Dragon Horse, the Monk Sand and the equally mischievous Pig on the dangerous trek West.
