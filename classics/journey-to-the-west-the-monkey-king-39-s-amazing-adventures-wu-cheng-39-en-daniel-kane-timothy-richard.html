  <title>Journey to the West: The Monkey King&#39;s Amazing Adventures - Wu Cheng&#39;en, Daniel Kane, Timothy Richard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;China&#39;s most popular traditional novel, &lt;I&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/I&gt; is the thrilling story of the Monkey King and his epic quest, with his trusted companions, to redeem himself.

More than anything else, though, the Monkey King loved mischief and rule&amp;#150;breaking, and was sure he was the most powerful creature in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But after defeat and punishment for his tricks, the Monkey King found himself wanting some things he never expected: to be disciplined and good enough to help the monk Hsuan Zhang on his mission to bring Buddhist Scriptures&amp;#151;and enlightenment&amp;#151;to China.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Readers of all ages will thrill to Timothy Richard&#39;s retelling of the Monkey King&#39;s exploits&amp;#151;whether in the Dragon King&#39;s underwater castle, the Halls of the Dead or the palace of Buddha himself&amp;#151;and find themselves captivated as the Monkey King joins Hsuan Zhang and their companions the Dragon Horse, the Monk Sand and the equally mischievous Pig on the dangerous trek West. Despite the tale&#39;s ancient origins, &lt;I&gt;Journey to the West&lt;/I&gt; proves as fresh and engaging an adventure as anything written today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
