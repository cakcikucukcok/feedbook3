          &lt;strong&gt;She had secrets no cop could ignore &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Undercover cop Zack can’t make sense of the beautiful, mysterious stranger who saved his life. She cares for him with skilled, gentle hands, awakening passions within him, but her haunted eyes speak of secrets. He knows he can’t rest until he keeps the terror permanently from her door.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Endless months of hiding from a killer have taught Krystle to be wary. Strong, compelling Zack makes her long to take shelter in his arms. But can she trust him with her deadly secret?&lt;/p&gt;
