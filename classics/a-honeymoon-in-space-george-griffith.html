  <title>A Honeymoon in Space - George Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who says classic science fiction is all hard edges and taciturn heroes? George Griffith&amp;#39;s classic A Honeymoon in Space follows newlyweds Zaidie Rettick and Lord Redgrave on their post-nuptial journey through the solar system, in which they encounter a staggering array of alien cultures and creatures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
George Griffith (1857&amp;ndash;1906), full name George Chetwynd Griffith-Jones, was a prolific British science fiction writer and noted explorer who wrote during the late Victorian and Edwardian age. Many of his visionary tales appeared in magazines such as Pearson&amp;#39;s Magazine and Pearson&amp;#39;s Weekly before being published as novels. Griffith was extremely popular in the United Kingdom, though he failed to find similar acclaim in the United States, in part due to his revolutionary and socialist views.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A journalist, rather than scientist, by background, what his stories lack in scientific rigour and literary grace they make up for in sheer exuberance of execution. &amp;quot;To-night that spark was to be shaken from the torch of Revolution, and to-morrow the first of the mines would explode...the armies of Europe would fight their way through the greatest war that the world had ever seen.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; from Griffith&amp;#39;s most famous novel The Angel of the Revolution." />
