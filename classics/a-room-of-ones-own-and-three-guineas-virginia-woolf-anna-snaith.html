  <title>A Room of Ones Own and Three Guineas - Virginia Woolf, Anna Snaith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intellectual freedom depends on material things. Poetry depends on intellectual freedom. And women have always been poor...In these two classic essays of feminist literature, Woolf argues passionately for womens intellectual freedom and their role in challenging the drive towards fascism and conflict.  In A Room of Ones Own she explores centuries of limitations placed on women, as well as celebrating the creative achievements of the women writers who overcame these obstacles. In this first history of womens writing, she describes the importance of education, financial independence, and equality ofopportunity to creative freedom. Three Guineas was written under the threat of fascism and impending war.  A radical articulation of Woolfs pacifist politics, it investigates the causes of gender inequalities and the ways in which womens historic outsider position make them crucial in the prevention of war. Both these works started life as talks to groups of young women, and their engaging wit and informality establish Woolf as one of the twentieth-centurys greatest essayists. Their arguments continue to reverberate in feminist discourse to this day.ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford Worlds Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxfords commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more." />
