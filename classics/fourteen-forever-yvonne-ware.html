      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Something exciting was going to happen; Lindsey just knew it. She had dreams, plans, and schemes for the year ahead. Shortly after her fourteenth birthday, her plans fall apart. Lindsey faces challenges and temptations she never considered.

As Lindsey becomes Zee, she finds hope in the unexpected, leaving her childhood behind in the uncertain 1970s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It wasn&#39;t like Zee to stand in silence. She usually preferred movement, motion, and conversation. She had never allowed the sound of her breath or her beating heart to speak above her voice. Perhaps it was his hand holding hers that settled her spirit; perhaps it was the warm, humid air or the fragrance of the night-blooming jasmine. She had spent many evenings on the screened patio, but she had never stood here before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
