  <title>The Sea Wolf (with an Introduction by Lewis Gannett) - Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack London’s 1904 novel “The Sea Wolf” is the story of Humphrey van Weyden, an effete gentleman who finds himself shipwrecked when the San Francisco ferry his is aboard collides with another ship in the fog. Adrift in the bay, Humphrey is rescued by Wolf Larsen, the brutish captain of a seal-hunting schooner, the “Ghost”. However his relief in being saved is short-lived, for he is soon put to work, essentially enslaved as a cabin boy forced to do menial work aboard the “Ghost” by Larsen. Humphrey finds that he must quickly adapt to the harsh environment of the vessel and over the course of the novel becomes toughened up by the strenuous work aboard the ship and in defending himself against other brutal members of the crew. Reportedly based on the real life sailor Captain Alexander MacLean, it is the characterization of Wolf Larsen that is the standout of the novel. A primitive, animalistic force, Captain Larsen is depicted as a perfect specimen of masculinity, a man with no moral compass, who values only his own survival and pleasure. “The Sea Wolf” is a thrilling tale of maritime adventure which stands as one of London’s finest literary achievements. This edition includes an introduction by Lewis Gannett and a biographical afterword." />
