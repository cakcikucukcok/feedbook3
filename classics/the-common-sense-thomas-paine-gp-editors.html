  <title>The Common Sense - Thomas Paine, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Common Sense&lt;/strong&gt; cites the evils of monarchy, accuses the British government of inflicting economic and social injustices upon the colonies, and points to the absurdity of an island attempting to rule a continent. Credited by George Washington as having changed the minds of many of his countrymen, the document sold over 500,000 copies within a few months.&lt;br /&gt;
Today, &amp;#39;The Common Sense&amp;#39; remains a landmark document in the struggle for freedom, distinguished not only by Paine&amp;#39;s ideas but also by its clear and passionate presentation. Designed to ignite public opinion against autocratic rule, the pamphlet offered a careful balance between imagination and judgment, and appropriate language and expression to fit the subject. It immediately found a receptive audience, heartened Washington&amp;#39;s despondent army, and foreshadowed much of the phrasing and substance of the Declaration of Independence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
