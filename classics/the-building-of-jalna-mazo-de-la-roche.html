  <title>The Building of Jalna - Mazo de la Roche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1944, &lt;i&gt;The Building of Jalna&lt;/i&gt; is one of sixteen books in the Jalna series written by Canada&amp;rsquo;s &lt;b&gt;Mazo de la Roche&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;i&gt;The Building of Jalna&lt;/i&gt;, Adeline lay thinking about the journey. They were leaving London. When might she see it again? Perhaps never, with all the dangers of travel. What would happen to her and Philip in the New World? What strange distant place lay waiting for them?&lt;br /&gt;
The vast and beautiful Canadian wilderness is the setting for this very special novel about Jalna. Unfolded here is the absorbing story of the beginning of Jalna &amp;mdash; of Adeline and Philip Whiteoak, who come across half a world to meet the challenge and promise of a new land. For them both, Jalna not only becomes a symbol of their love, but a heritage for generations to come." />
