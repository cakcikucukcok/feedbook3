  <title>Great Expectations (stage version) - Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A beautifully simple adaptation of one of Dickens&#39;s best-loved novels, bringing it thrillingly to life for the stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the orphan Pip meets the convict Magwitch in a graveyard and is forced to help him escape, his life takes a series of unexpected turns. Invited to the house of the mysterious Miss Havisham, he falls in love with her adopted daughter, the beautiful but cold-hearted Estella. Then the generosity of an unknown benefactor sends him to London to become a gentleman. But the truth behind his change of fortune, once revealed, is not what Pip expects...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Eminently actable and stageable, this version is also ideal for schools and amateur theatre companies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Contains introductions by Simon Callow, Lucinda Dickens Hawksley (great-great-great granddaughter of Charles Dickens) and Clifford herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#39;What is so admirable... is that it decisively shrugs off the many screen adaptations to make something that is pure theatre&#39; &lt;I&gt;The Times&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#39;Arresting... the adaptation is a model of its kind&#39; &lt;I&gt;Whatsonstage.com&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
