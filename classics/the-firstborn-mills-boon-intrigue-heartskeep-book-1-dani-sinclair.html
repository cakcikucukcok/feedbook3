          &lt;strong&gt;THE BOLD, FEARLESS TWIN&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That was Heartskeep heiress Hayley Thomas–until the blackouts, slamming doors and nighttime whispers began. Was someone at Heartskeep toying with her or was she going crazy? With her sister away and the eerie family estate full of estranged relatives, Hayley sought help from a disturbingly sensual stranger….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With his sinful smile and aura of mythic power, Bram Myers could have been Satan himself. So how had he become a guardian angel to the stubborn benefactress whose very presence wreaked havoc with his senses? Yet when a shaken Hayley trembled in his shielding embrace, he knew he would walk through fire to keep her safe from the evil closing in.&lt;/p&gt;
