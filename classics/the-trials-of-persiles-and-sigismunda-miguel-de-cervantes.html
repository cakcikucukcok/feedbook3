  <title>The Trials of Persiles and Sigismunda - Miguel de Cervantes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Considered by many as the greatest of all Spanish authors, Miguel de Cervantes is most well-known of course for &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; a work of such literary impact that its historical importance cannot be understated. Unfortunately Cervantes&#39; other works are often overlooked and characterized as inferior to his masterpiece. While his other writings never gained the popularity of &quot;Don Quixote,&quot; he did author several other works that are worthy of consideration. Amongst these is &quot;The Trials of Persiles and Sigismunda,&quot; a romantic novel that Cervantes finished just three days before his death, and which was posthumously published in 1617. The work stands in contrast to &quot;Don Quixote&quot; as a work that embraces the fantastic rather than the ordinary. While the history of literature will likely continue to regard &quot;Don Quixote&quot; as Cervantes&#39; greatest contribution he himself believed this work to have been his crowning achievement." />
