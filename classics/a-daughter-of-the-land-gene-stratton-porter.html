  <title>A Daughter of the Land - Gene Stratton-Porter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you loved Gene Stratton-Porter&amp;#39;s A Girl of the Limberlost, be sure to add her later novel A Daughter of the Land to your reading list. The family that serves as the focus of the novel isn&amp;#39;t perfect, but they manage to fix their foibles and come together to make something beautiful and lasting. It&amp;#39;s an engaging read for anyone who&amp;#39;s ever fantasized about leaving city life behind and living off the land.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gene Stratton-Porter (August 17, 1863 &amp;ndash; December 6, 1924), born Geneva Grace Stratton, was an American author, early naturalist, and nature photographer. She used her position and income as a well-known author to support conservation of Limberlost Swamp and other wetlands in the state of Indiana. She wrote several best-selling novels and well-received columns in national magazines, such as McCall&amp;#39;s. Her works were translated into several languages, including Braille, and Stratton-Porter was estimated to have had 50 million readers around the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her novel, A Girl of the Limberlost, was adapted four times as a film, and the story of Gene Stratton-Porter herself was written as a one-woman play, A Song of the Wilderness, by playwright and actor Larry Gard for his wife, actress Marcia Quick. Although Stratton-Porter wanted to focus on nature books, it was her romantic novels that gained her fame and revenue. These generated the income that allowed her to pursue her nature studies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was an accomplished author, artist and photographer. One of Stratton-Porter&amp;#39;s last novels, Her Father&amp;#39;s Daughter (1921), was set outside Los Angeles. She had moved about 1920 for health reasons and to expand her business ventures into the movie industry. This novel presented a unique window into Stratton-Porter&amp;#39;s feelings about World War I-era racism and nativism, especially relating to immigrants of Asian descent." />
