          &lt;strong&gt;Detective Judah Finnegan didn&#39;t believe in happy endings - too many years fighting crime had left him cynical. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when the discovery of an abandoned baby brought him back into the arms of his lost love, he realized he would have to find a new way of looking at the world or risk losing the woman of his dreams. Dr. Sophie Brennan had always been able to see through Judah&#39;s bitterness into the loner&#39;s heart, but she could never convince him that he was worthy of love.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As they worked to save the baby, they tried to stay out of each other&#39;s arms, but their old passion was too powerful to resist. Could their love survive a second chance?&lt;/p&gt;
