  <title>By Pond and River - Arabella Buckley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By Pond and River by Arabella Buckley, first published in 1907.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Through life stories of frogs, dragon-flies, fish, water-bugs, water birds, otters, and voles, children&amp;#39;s interest in water creatures is awakened. An exhibit of water plants at a flower show concludes the volume. Seven color illustrations and numerous black and white drawings complement the text.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book is intended to interest children in country life. They are written in the simplest language, so as to be fit for each class to read aloud. But the information given in them requires explanation and illustration by the teacher. I have, in fact, tried to make each lesson the groundwork for oral teaching, in the course of which the children should be en- couraged to observe, to bring in specimens, and to ask questions. Then when the chapter is read and re-read, as is the case with most school books, it will become part of the child&amp;#39;s own knowledge." />
