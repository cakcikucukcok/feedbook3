  <title>Narrative of Sojourner Truth - Sojourner Truth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hailed as an inspiring memoir during a time of slavery, &lt;em&gt;The Narrative of Sojourner Truth&lt;/em&gt;  is not just about the emancipation of an African American woman, but also the strength of her faith. Truth provides the narrative of her life, from her early years as a slave to her liberation and life as a freed woman. A staunch activist, Truth also gives her readers insight on gender equality issues faced by women of her time and discusses the abolitionist movement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raised as a slave, Sojourner Truth was illiterate and was able to complete her memoir by dictating it to her friend and neighbour, Olive Gilbert. Originally published in 1850, &lt;em&gt;The Narrative of Sojourner Truth&lt;/em&gt; became an important work to the abolitionist movement, and was republished five times during the author’s life alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HarperTorch brings great works of non-fiction and the dramatic arts to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms. Look for more titles in the HarperTorch collection to build your digital library.&lt;/p&gt;" />
