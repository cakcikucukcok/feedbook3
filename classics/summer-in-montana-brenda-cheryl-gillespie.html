  <title>Summer in Montana - Brenda Cheryl Gillespie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Orphaned at birth, Elizabeth had to fight her whole life against the feelings of loneliness and abandonment.   Now the time had come for her to make a new life for herself.   The opportunity was there with the whole big world open to her, but would she be able to overcome the trauma caused by feelings of being unwanted in order to begin anew?  With the orphanage in her rearview mirror, Elizabeth must now enter a world of complete strangers in unchartered territory.  The little red-haired girl with big green eyes, who nobody wanted to adopt, was now grown and once again thrown into a world of uncertainty.   Would Elizabeth ever have the life she desired with a home of her own?  Would that life include someone to love, who would return her love?   Or, would Elizabeth once again suffer the ordeal of being rejected?" />
