Typee, his first book, focused on the French Polynesian island of Nuku Hiva (Marquesas Islands). Omoo starts after Melville leaves Nuku Hiva, and centers on his adventures on a whaling ship, the ship's subsequent "soft mutiny" and his imprisonment with a majority of the ship's crew on the island of Tahiti.<br /><b><i>Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas by ...</i></b> | Melville's second book, Omoo, begins where his first book, Typee, left off. As the author said, "It embraces adventures in the South Seas (of a totally different character from 'Typee') and includes an eventful cruise in an English Colonial Whaleman (a Sydney Ship) and a comical residence on the island of Tahiti."<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Omoo: A Narrative of Adventures in the South Seas - Herman Melville</a> </h3></p><hr/>
