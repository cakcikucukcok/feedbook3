        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Never get personally involved in a story.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For star reporter Tory Patton, that was the cardinal rule of TV news. But when a fellow journalist and Athena Academy graduate was taken hostage in a war zone–and a rival network broke the story–Tory took it very personally, giving up the safety of her anchor desk to investigate in the field. The assignment was risky from the start, including a shocking complication: Tory&#39;s unexpected pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her stubborn, covert-agent lover begging her to go home and her questions stirring up a hornet&#39;s nest, Tory suddenly faced reporting a story that could make her career but cost her everything she loved.&lt;/p&gt;
