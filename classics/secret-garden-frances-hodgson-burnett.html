  <title>Secret Garden - Frances Hodgson Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Orphaned by a cholera outbreak, young Mary Lennox is sent to live with her uncle in Yorkshire. Sad and lonely, Mary is left to explore the house and the grounds alone, one day finding the secret garden that becomes her salvation. Aided by her friend Dickon and the kindly gardener, Ben Weatherstaff, Mary returns the garden to its former glory, helps her cousin, Colin, recover his health, and brings joy back into the life of her uncle.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One of Frances Hodgson Burnett’s most popular novels, &lt;em&gt;The Secret Garden&lt;/em&gt; was originally published as a serial starting in fall 1910 in &lt;em&gt;The American Magazine&lt;/em&gt;. Ahead of its time in many respects, &lt;em&gt;The Secret Garden&lt;/em&gt; championed good health coming from healthy food, physical exercise, and a positive attitude. It continues to be a beloved childhood classic, and has been adapted multiple times for the screen and stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;HarperPerennial Classics brings great works of literature to life in digital format, upholding the highest standards in ebook production and celebrating reading in all its forms.
