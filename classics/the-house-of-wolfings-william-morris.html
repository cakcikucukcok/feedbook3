  <title>The House of Wolfings -  William Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The House of Wolfings&amp;quot;, written in 1890 by William Morris, some argue, is a demonstration of Morris&amp;#39; socialism as the society described, though not an utopia, is clan-based, elects leaders and makes decisions in clan tribal meetings. Notwithstanding, it tells the story of how Thiodolf and his clan - the Wolfings, men of the Mark- fight and vanquish the Roman invaders. The book is built with Morris&amp;#39; knowledge of the historical period and his own idealistic views, which allow him to combine facts and mythical elements. Thiodolf is protected by a dwarfish coat of mail, given to him by his lover Wood Sun, herself one of the Vala, the immortals. But things are not what they seem and what are meant to protect him, but a curse...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even apart from the obvious influence this story had on Tolkien, and his masterpiece &amp;quot;The Lord of the Rings&amp;quot;, it&amp;rsquo;s an enjoyable read. The battle scenes are well-written and the characters are interesting. A lot of detail is given regarding the land, the houses of the Mark, their histories, and even their marriage customs. It&amp;rsquo;s unusual to read such convincing world-building from a book written that time." />
