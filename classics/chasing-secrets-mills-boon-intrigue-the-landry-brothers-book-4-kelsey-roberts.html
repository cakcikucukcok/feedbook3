          &lt;strong&gt;UNLAWFULLY WEDDED?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Clayton Landry would do whatever it took to prove his innocence–and Victoria DeSimone was the key to clearing his name. Her testimony had sent him to jail for a crime he didn&#39;t commit and he could never forget what she had cost him. Clayton had escaped to find justice…but his salvation meant marrying a woman he couldn&#39;t trust.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Newly wedded to an escaped con and on the run from the law, Victoria didn&#39;t think things could get much worse–but she was wrong. When their quest to clear Clayton&#39;s name turned deadly, their need to believe in each other was suddenly a matter of life or death.&lt;/p&gt;
