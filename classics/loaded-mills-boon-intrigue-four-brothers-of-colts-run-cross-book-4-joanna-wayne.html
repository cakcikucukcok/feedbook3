          &lt;strong&gt;Texas charm, cowboy cool and loaded with sex appeal! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Coming to a woman’s rescue was all in a day’s work for billionaire rancher Matt Collingsworth. Little did he know that the woman he’d jumped off his horse to save was working undercover, investigating him. Exposing the Collingsworths was a golden opportunity for Shelly to prove she had what it took to be a real CIA agent.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What Shelly had to do involved the highest national security and could devastate the Collingsworth empire…unless her desire for gorgeous Matt got in the way!&lt;/p&gt;
