  <title>The Princess of Cleves (Centaur Classics) [The 100 greatest novels of all time - #53] - Madame de La Fayette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;One of the greatest [French novels].&quot; —Malcolm Cowley
&quot;A story of hopeless love and mute renunciation in which the stately tenor of the lives depicted is hardly ruffled by the exultations and agonies succeeding each other below the surface.&quot; —Edith Wharton
Though the Congress of Cercamp had been broken off, the negotiations for the peace were continued, and things were so disposed, that towards the latter end of February the conferences were reassumed at Chateau-Cambresis; the same plenipotentiaries were sent as before, and the Mareschal de St. Andre being one, his absence freed the Duke de Nemours from a rival, who was formidable rather from his curiosity in observing those who addressed to Madam de Cleves, than from any advances he was capable of making himself in her favour." />
