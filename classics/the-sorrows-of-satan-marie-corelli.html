  <title>The Sorrows of Satan - Marie Corelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1895, &amp;quot;The Sorrows of Satan&amp;quot; is Marie Corelli&amp;#39;s masterpiece and the novel where her views on religion and society find their clearest and fullest expression. And on another level it is a savage and bitter riposte to her critics, who had vilified her previous novel, &amp;quot;Barabbas&amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Sorrows of Satan&amp;quot; is a faustian novel and it is widely regarded as one of the world&amp;#39;s first bestsellers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the Devil arrives in &lt;i&gt;fin de si&amp;egrave;cle&lt;/i&gt; London in the form of the handsome and charming Prince Lucio Rim&amp;acirc;nez, his work promises to be easy. After all, in a world where science and materialism have replaced a belief in God, who will suspect Lucio of being Satan in disguise? Lucio sets his sights on Geoffrey Tempest, a starving novelist who has just inherited a fortune, and promises to guide him to power and fame. As the tragic story of Geoffrey&amp;#39;s meteoric rise and fall unfolds, Marie Corelli lays bare the hypocrisy, immorality, and irreligiousness of modern life, satire which is as fresh and relevant today as ever." />
