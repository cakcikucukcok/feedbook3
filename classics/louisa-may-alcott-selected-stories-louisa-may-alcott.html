A Christmas Dream, and How It Came to Be True&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m so tired of Christmas I wish there never would be another one!&amp;quot; exclaimed a discontented-looking little girl, as she sat idly watching her mother arrange a pile of gifts two days before they were to be given.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why, Effie, what a dreadful thing to say! You are as bad as old Scrooge; and I&amp;#39;m afraid something will happen to you, as it did to him, if you don&amp;#39;t care for dear Christmas,&amp;quot; answered mamma, almost dropping the silver horn she was filling with delicious candies.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Who was Scrooge? What happened to him?&amp;quot; asked Effie, with a glimmer of interest in her listless face, as she picked out the sourest lemon-drop she could find; for nothing sweet suited her just then.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He was one of Dickens&amp;#39;s best people, and you can read the charming story some day. He hated Christmas until a strange dream showed him how dear and beautiful it was, and made a better man of him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I shall read it; for I like dreams, and have a great many curious ones myself. But they don&amp;#39;t keep me from being tired of Christmas,&amp;quot; said Effie, poking discontentedly among the sweeties for something worth eating.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why are you tired of what should be the happiest time of all the year?&amp;quot; asked mamma, anxiously.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Perhaps I shouldn&amp;#39;t be if I had something new. But it is always the same, and there isn&amp;#39;t any more surprise about it. I always find heaps of goodies in my stocking. Don&amp;#39;t like some of them, and soon get tired of those I do like. We always have a great dinner, and I eat too much, and feel ill next day. Then there is a Christmas tree somewhere, with a doll on top, or a stupid old Santa Claus, and children dancing and screaming over bonbons and toys that break, and shiny things that are of no use. Really, mamma, I&amp;#39;ve had so many Christmases all alike that I don&amp;#39;t think I can bear another one.&amp;quot; And Effie laid herself flat on the sofa, as if the mere idea was too much for her." />

Louise Alcott is best known for her book Little Women. This compilation of stories were originally published anonymously in "Frank Leslie's Lady's magazine" between 1868 and 1870.<br /><b><i>The Lost Stories Of Louisa May Alcott by Louisa May Alcott</i></b> | On November 29, 1832, Louisa May Alcott (1832-1888) was born the second daughter of Amos Bronson Alcott and Abigail "Abba" May in Germantown, Pennsylvania. Her father, Bronson Alcott was a teacher that believed children should enjoy learning, a controversial notion for the time and he moved the family to Boston, Massachusetts in 1844 where he established the Temple School and joined the Transcendental Club with Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.<br /><b><i>Louisa May Alcott - American Literature</i></b> | The first two stories are from Alcott's "Hospital Sketches"; together with the third story, they deal with protagonists who work as nurses for Civil War soldiers. "My Contraband" has as a key theme the legacy of slavery.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Louisa May Alcott - Selected Stories - Louisa May Alcott</a> </h3></p><hr/>
