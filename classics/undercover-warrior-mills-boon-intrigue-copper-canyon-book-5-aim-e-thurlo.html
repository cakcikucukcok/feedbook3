          &lt;strong&gt;A NAVAJO UNDERCOVER AGENT COMES TO THE RESCUE OF AN INNOCENT VICTIM IN ANOTHER COPPER CANYON MYSTERY BY AWARD-WINNING AUTHOR AIMÉE THURLO. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Erin Barrett was the sole survivor of an armed assault on her company. Her saving grace? Undercover agent Kyle Goodluck, who&#39;d grown from troubled youth to total warrior. Though he agreed to protect Erin, he still had unanswered questions. Starting with how much she could be trusted. But only Erin knew what these terrorists wanted–and were willing to kill for. Kyle just had to gauge how forthcoming she was going to be about it. Standing their ground as New Mexico heated up with cross fire, Kyle wouldn&#39;t settle for anything less than absolute victory. And with Erin as his spirit guide, he wouldn&#39;t have to settle for anything anymore….&lt;/p&gt;
