  <title>A Fair Barbarian - Frances Hodgson Burnett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Frances Hodgson Burnett&amp;#39;s A Fair Barbarian, cultures clash when an affluent American heiress makes a splash in a sleepy British village. Octavia Bassett, a spirited young woman who hails from the untamed outback of Nevada, shocks and offends many of the staid aristocrats she encounters -- but she manages to capture a few hearts, as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Frances Hodgson Burnett (24 November 1849 &amp;ndash; 29 October 1924) was a British-American novelist and playwright. She is best known for the three children&amp;#39;s novels Little Lord Fauntleroy (published in 1885&amp;ndash;1886), A Little Princess (1905), and The Secret Garden (1911). Frances Eliza Hodgson was born in Cheetham, Manchester, England. After her father died in 1852, the family fell on straitened circumstances and in 1865 emigrated to the United States, settling near Knoxville, Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There Frances began writing to help earn money for the family, publishing stories in magazines from the age of 19. In 1870, her mother died, and in 1872 Frances married Swan Burnett, who became a medical doctor. The Burnetts lived for two years in Paris, where their two sons were born, before returning to the United States to live in Washington, D.C. Burnett then began to write novels, the first of which (That Lass o&amp;#39; Lowrie&amp;#39;s), was published to good reviews. Little Lord Fauntleroy was published in 1886 and made her a popular writer of children&amp;#39;s fiction, although her romantic adult novels written in the 1890s were also popular. She wrote and helped to produce stage versions of Little Lord Fauntleroy and A Little Princess." />
