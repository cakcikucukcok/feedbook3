  <title>The Second Achmed Abdullah Megapack: 17 Classic Stories - Achmed Abdullah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you&#39;ve picked up this volume, you may already be familiar with Achmed Abdullah&#39;s work from the first volume, &quot;The Achmed Abdullah Megapack.&quot; If not, no harm done; both Megapacks contain short stories which can be read in any order. The only real difference is that Volume 1 contains quite a few supernatural stories, while Volume 2 focuses more on &quot;contemporary&quot; (early 1900s) life in exotic locales, like the Middle East, China, and New York City (primarily in Chinatown). Crime is frequently touched upon; many of these stories qualify as mysteries. &lt;P&gt; Included: &lt;P&gt; THE EVENING RICE&lt;BR&gt; THE HATCHETMAN&lt;BR&gt; FEUD&lt;BR&gt; REPRISAL&lt;BR&gt; THE HOME-COMING&lt;BR&gt; THE DANCE ON THE HILL&lt;BR&gt; THE RIVER OF HATE&lt;BR&gt; THE SOUL OF A TURK&lt;BR&gt; MORITURI&lt;BR&gt; THE JESTER&lt;BR&gt; THE STRENGTH OF THE LITTLE THIN THREAD&lt;BR&gt; GRAFTER AND MASTER GRAFTER&lt;BR&gt; THE LOGICAL TALE OF THE FOUR CAMELS&lt;BR&gt; THE TWO-HANDED SWORD&lt;BR&gt; BLACK POPPIES&lt;BR&gt; THE PERFECT WAY&lt;BR&gt; TAO&lt;P&gt; A note for the sensitive: Some of these stories are not &quot;politically correct&quot; by today&#39;s standards. Please keep in mind that Abdullah was writing in a different age, with different standards of propriety.
