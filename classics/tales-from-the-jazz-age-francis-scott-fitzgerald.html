  <title>Tales from the jazz age - Francis Scott Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This essential Fitzgerald collection contains some of the writer&amp;#39;s most famous and celebrated stories. In &amp;quot;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,&amp;quot; an extraordinary child is born an old man, growing younger as the world ages around him. &amp;quot;The Diamond as Big as the Ritz,&amp;quot; a fable of excess and greed, shows two boarding school classmates mired in deception as they make their fortune in gemstones. And in the classic novella &amp;quot;May Day,&amp;quot; debutantes dance the night away as war veterans and socialists clash in the streets of New York. Opening the book is a playful and irreverent set of notes from the author, documenting the real-life pressures and experiences that shaped these stories, from his years at Princeton to his cravings for luxury to the May Day Riots of 1919. Taken as a whole, this collection brings to vivid life the dazzling excesses, stunning contrasts, and simmering unrest of a glittering era. Its 1922 publication furthered Fitzgerald&amp;#39;s reputation as a master storyteller, and its legacy staked his place as the spokesman of an age." />
