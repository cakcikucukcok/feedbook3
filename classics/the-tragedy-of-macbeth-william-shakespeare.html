  <title>The Tragedy of Macbeth - William Shakespeare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Macbeth is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, thought to have been first performed in 1606. It dramatises the damaging physical and psychological effects of political ambition on those who seek power for its own sake. Of all the plays that Shakespeare wrote during the reign of James I, who was patron of Shakespeare&amp;#39;s acting company, Macbeth most clearly reflects the playwright&amp;#39;s relationship with his sovereign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
A brave Scottish general named Macbeth receives a prophecy from a trio of witches that one day he will become King of Scotland. Consumed by ambition and spurred to action by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan and takes the Scottish throne for himself. He is then wracked with guilt and paranoia. Forced to commit more and more murders to protect himself from enmity and suspicion, he soon becomes a tyrannical ruler. The bloodbath and consequent civil war swiftly take Macbeth and Lady Macbeth into the realms of madness and death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English poet, playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world&amp;#39;s pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England&amp;#39;s national poet, and the &amp;quot;Bard of Avon&amp;quot;. His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright." />
