A silent movie adaptation of the novel was also released on April 30, 1922. The film starred Tom Douglas as Milt Daggett and Marjorie Seaman as Claire Boltwood. Plot summary [ edit ]<br /><b><i>Free Air - Wikipedia</i></b> | Sinclair Lewis did something very similar at the end of each segment of his 1917 serial Free Air by inserting an abrupt meeting between one of his two protagonists and the person he or she least wants to see.<br /><b><i>Free Air by Sinclair Lewis - Goodreads</i></b> | Fame was just around the corner when Sinclair Lewis published Free Air in 1919, a year before Main Street. The latter novel zeroed in on the town of Gopher Prairie; the former stopped there briefly and then took the reader by automobile in search of America.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Free Air - Sinclair Lewis</a> </h3></p><hr/>
