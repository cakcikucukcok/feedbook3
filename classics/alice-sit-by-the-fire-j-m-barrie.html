  <title>Alice Sit-By-The-Fire - J.M. Barrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Written immediately after the play that would launch J. M. Barrie to international acclaim, Peter Pan, Alice Sit-By-The-Fire is just as charming, sweet and madcap as its predecessor. A group of older children are introduced to their long-absent parents, and it initially appears that the family unit may be irreparably broken. Will they be able to find a way to live together without driving each other crazy?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
J.M. Barrie (9 May 1860 &amp;ndash; 19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys, who inspired him to write about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in The Little White Bird), then to write Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn&amp;#39;t Grow Up, a &amp;quot;fairy play&amp;quot; about an ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although he continued to write successfully, Peter Pan overshadowed his other work, and is credited with popularising the name Wendy. Barrie unofficially adopted the Davies boys following the deaths of their parents. Barrie was made a baronet by George V on 14 June 1913, and a member of the Order of Merit in the 1922 New Year Honours. Before his death, he gave the rights to the Peter Pan works to Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, which continues to benefit from them." />
