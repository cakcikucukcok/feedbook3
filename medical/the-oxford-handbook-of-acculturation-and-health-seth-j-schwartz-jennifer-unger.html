  <title>The Oxford Handbook of Acculturation and Health - Seth J. Schwartz, Jennifer Unger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Acculturation and Health&lt;/em&gt; expertly brings together two very distinct, but complementary, streams of work and thought: theoretical and methodological work on acculturation, and the applied work linking acculturation to various health outcomes among international migrants and their families. In this important volume, the work of landmark acculturation theorists and methodologists come together to showcase applied epidemiologic and intervention work on the issues facing acculturation and public health today.
Edited by Seth J. Schwartz and Jennifer B. Unger, this &lt;em&gt;Handbook&lt;/em&gt; is divided into two important parts for readers. Part one features chapters that are dedicated to theoretical and methodological work on acculturation, including definitional issues, measurement issues, and procedures for studying acculturation across immigrant groups and national contexts. The second part focuses on the links between acculturation and various health outcomes, such as obesity, physical activity, drug and alcohol abuse, mental health, delinquency, and suicide.
Notably, because a majority of the research on acculturation and health has been conducted on Hispanic immigration, this volume contextualizes that research and offers readers compelling insight for how to apply these principles to other immigrant groups in the United States and around the world." />
