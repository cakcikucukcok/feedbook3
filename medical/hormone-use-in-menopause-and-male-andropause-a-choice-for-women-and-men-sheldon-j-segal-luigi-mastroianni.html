  <title>Hormone Use in Menopause and Male Andropause: A Choice for Women and Men - Sheldon J. Segal, Luigi Mastroianni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, by two of the most distinguished figures in fertility and reproduction research, answers all the most common questions about menaupause and andropause, and hormone resupplement therapy (HRT) for menopausal women.  It offers explanations of all aspects of this subject, presenting balanced and reliable information about benefits, risks, and prospects for this field.      Segal invented Norplant, the first long-term implantable contraceptive, and as the leader of Reproductive Biology at the Population Council, he orchestrated and coordinated the research and trials leading to basically every new contraceptive introduced over a period of about 25 years.      Mastroianni did more than anyone else to develop in vitro fertizilation as a viable treatment option, and was for many years the chairman of the largest department of obstetrics and gynecology, and the director of the most successful IVF clinic.  This book is unique in including coverage of the climacteric in men." />
