  <title>Psoriatic Arthritis - Dafna Gladman, Cheryl F. Rosen, Vinod Chandran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the past 30 years, there has been increasing recognition of psoriatic arthritis as a distinct clinical entity. Psoriatic arthritis occurs mostly in patients with psoriasis and may affect up to 1% of the general population. It has many similarities to other forms of spondyloarthritis, and must be differentiated from related conditions. Given that most patients with psoriatic arthritis have skin and musculoskeletal diseases that significantly affect their qualityof life and function, patients are ideally managed in a multidisciplinary clinic with rheumatologists, dermatologists and a nurse specialist, physical therapist and occupational therapist. &amp;amp;lt;i&amp;amp;gt;Psoriatic Arthritis&amp;amp;lt;/i&amp;amp;gt; covers the epidemiology and diagnostic and classification criteria, describing the clinical features of the disease, including skin and nail involvement, articular, and other extra-articular manifestations. Laboratory features and imaging characteristics are covered in detail, along with co-morbidities and their impact. A comprehensive review of skin disease therapy is also provided, along with the various treatment options for jointdisease, including traditional disease modifying therapy and newer biologic agents . This comprehensive yet concise and practical volume is the perfect guide to psoriatic arthritis for the busy practitioner, and will be of interest to trainees and specialists in rheumatology and dermatology." />
