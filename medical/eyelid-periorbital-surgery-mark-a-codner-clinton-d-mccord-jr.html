  <title>Eyelid &amp; Periorbital Surgery - Mark A. Codner, Clinton D. McCord Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I found this up-to-date factual book to be well-written and relatively concise...Its easy readability will make it both appealing and useful for students, trainees, and experts.&lt;/em&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;PMFA News&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;...there are 80 aesthetic and reconstructive oculoplastic videos, 30 of which are new, which makes this a one-of-a-kind video library. What I liked about the videos, especially the new ones, is the high quality, clarity, and details of technique provided by the authors who do the voiceovers themselves.&lt;/em&gt; -- &lt;strong&gt;Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FIRST PRIZE from the BMA Medical Book Awards for Surgical Specialties!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Eyelid &amp; Periorbital Surgery&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; offers expansive coverage of aesthetic and reconstructive procedures in oculoplastic surgery. Oculoplastic and plastic surgeons combine their talents in this unique two-volume clinical resource that features comprehensive guidance for solving both common and rare eyelid and periorbital problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With more than 2,900 photos and color illustrations, this edition has 26 rewritten first edition chapters and expands on an additional 13 new chapters, including topics ranging from nonsurgical periorbital rejuvenation to male blepharoplasty. Best of all, there are more than 30 new surgical videos demonstrating the latest surgical techniques. Also included is a complimentary eBook.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Divided into 5 sections, the book begins by covering the fundamentals including periorbital and eyelid anatomy, eyelid function, innervation, biomechanics, and tissue grafts. The following section discusses aesthetic surgery including procedures such as brow lift, upper and lower blepharoplasty, midface lift, treatment of malar bags and festoons, lateral canthal dysfunction, and management of chemosis.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A new section has been added on aesthetic nonsurgical state-of-the-art periorbital treatments with an update on injectable fillers, botulinum toxin injections, and fat grafting. The reconstructive surgery section covers ptosis surgery, upper and lower eyelid reconstruction, entropion and ectropion reconstruction, surgery for facial paralysis, malignant eyelid tumors, Graves&#39; disease, and the treatment of pediatric patients.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new final section covers orbital and lacrimal surgery including blowout fracture of the orbital floor, neuroophthalmologic injuries, evisceration and enucleation, late repair of orbital fractures, and management of the lacrimal system. Step-by-step descriptions and detailed videos provide a wide variety of tips, clinical pearls, and personal insights from the authors making this an invaluable resource for surgeons interested in the topic.&lt;/p&gt;" />
