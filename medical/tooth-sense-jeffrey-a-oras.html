  <title>Tooth Sense - Jeffrey A. Oras</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The prospect of dental care for many presents no problem, yet for others it does. Jeffrey A Oras, DMD, has looked beyond age old stereotypes attached to anxiety about dentistry, widening his understanding of what makes this anxiety unique both to dental care and at the same time related to how all of us, whether anxious or not about dental care, respond to life itself. Tooth Sense is meant to not only demystify what is behind all this, but also to offer practical insights and solutions so that everyone can more comfortably receive better carewhether youre going in for a complicated procedure or routine cleaning.
The authors quest to develop the concept of Tooth Sense has taken him well beyond his original intentions, into the mysteries behind the evolution of the mouth and its surrounding organs and how the workings of this part of our anatomy may significantly impact the quality of all aspects of our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part memoir, part practical guidebook, and part invitation to join Dr. Oras in looking more fully at what comprises these mysteries, Tooth Sense also assesses for dentists and patients alike the impact of various ways that dentistry is actually delivered, such as through dental office design or through using team based practice models.  Throughout, we are encouraged to view dentistry as much more than a set of procedures and protocols.&lt;/p&gt;" />
