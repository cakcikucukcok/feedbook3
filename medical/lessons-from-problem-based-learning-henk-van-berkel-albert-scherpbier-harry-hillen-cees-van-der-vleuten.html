  <title>Lessons from Problem-based Learning - Henk van Berkel, Albert Scherpbier, Harry Hillen, Cees van der Vleuten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Problem-based learning (PBL) has excited interest among educators around the world for several decades. Among the most notable applications of PBL is the approach taken at the Faculty of Health, Medicine and Life sciences (FHML) at Maastricht University, the Netherlands. Starting in 1974 as a medical school, the faculty embarked on the innovative pathway of problem-based learning, trying to establish a medical training program which applied recent insights of
education which would be better adapted to the needs of the modem physician. The medical school, currently part of the FHML, can be considered as an &#39;established&#39; school, where original innovations and educational changes have become part of a routine. 
The first book to bring this wealth of information together, Lessons from Problem-based Learning  documents those findings and shares the experiences of those involved, to encourage further debate and refinement of problem-based learning in specific applications elsewhere and in general educational discussion and thought. Each chapter provides a description of why and what has been done in the Maastricht program, followed by reflection on the benefits and issues that have arisen for
these developments. The final section of the book examines the application of PBL in the future, and how it is likely to develop further." />
