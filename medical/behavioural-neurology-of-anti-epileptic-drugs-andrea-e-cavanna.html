  <title>Behavioural Neurology of Anti-epileptic Drugs - Andrea E. Cavanna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Antiepileptic drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications by both neurologists and psychiatrists, as they exert a number of effects which extend far beyond their anticonvulsant properties. There is growing evidence that each antiepileptic drug is characterised by a specific behavioural profile. Behavioural Neurology of Antiepileptic Drugs: A Practical Guide offers a user-friendly guide to the use of antiepileptic drugs and their behavioural
effects on patients with epilepsy and primary psychiatric conditions.
Written over 18 chapters, this practical handbook guides the reader through the breadth of medications used in modern epilepsy and psychiatry practice alphabetically, including information on each drug&#39;s indications, contra-indications, side-effects, and important interactions. This resource covers practical information on prescribing and monitoring to ensure the reader has the most up-to-date evidence-based guidance at their fingertips, and diagrams are used throughout to aid visual learning.
With up-to-date content and a practical approach, Behavioural Neurology of Antiepileptic Drugs: A Practical Guide is an invaluable resource for consultants and trainees in neurology, psychiatry, and neuropsychiatry, as well as to pharmacists and specialist epilepsy nurses." />
