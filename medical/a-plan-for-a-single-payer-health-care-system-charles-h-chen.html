  <title>A Plan for a Single-Payer Health Care System - Charles H. Chen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Approximately fifty million people in the United States have no health insurance. Dr. Charles Chen, an obstetrician and gynecologist for almost thirty years, agrees with many people in this country that health insurance should cover every citizen, not just those who can afford to pay the rates.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;A Plan for a Single Payer Health Care System&lt;/i&gt; takes an in-depth look at every aspect of our current health care system and provides a strategic plan, along with innovative solutions for reforming the system.&lt;p&gt;
In an easy-to-understand format, Dr. Chen provides clear definitions and the pros and cons of utilizing three potential health care systems. Dr. Chen presents the results from his research on several international health care systems and then proposes the best solution for America. He recommends several concrete ideas, including establishing a Department of the National Health Care System, requesting the support of large corporations who pay high medical premiums for employees, and allowing uninsured citizens to purchase a low-cost health plan from the government.&lt;p&gt;
The ability to receive medical treatment should be a basic human right. Dr. Chen&#39;s plan for improvement helps shine a bright light on a situation that has quickly become critical for this country. His plan will ultimately help ensure that all citizens have access to health insurance." />
