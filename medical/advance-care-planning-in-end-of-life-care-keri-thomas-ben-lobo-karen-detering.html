  <title>Advance Care Planning in End of Life Care - Keri Thomas, Ben Lobo, Karen Detering</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Advance Care Planning (ACP) is an essential part of end of life care in the UK and most developed countries.  It enables more people to live well and die as they would choose, and has significant implications for the individual person, their family and carers, and our wider society. In the context of an ageing population and increasing possibilities for medical interventions, ACP is a particularly important aspect of quality care.
Expanded and fully updated throughout, this new edition gives a comprehensive overview of ACP and explores a wide range of issues and practicalities in providing end of life care. Written by experts from around the world, the book takes a comprehensive look at the subject by exploring the wide range of issues and practicalities in providing ACP; framing the purpose, process, and outcomes of these plans; and providing an important update on national and international research, policy and
practice. Chapters also discuss values, goals and priorities, and include detailed case examples to aid best practice.
This book is an invaluable resource for all clinicians involved in the caring for people in their final stages of life. It is of particular value to GPs, palliative care specialists, geriatricians, social care teams, researchers and policy leads interested in improving end of life care." />
