  <title>Becoming a Chiropractor - Christina Cunliffe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The chiropractic profession was originally founded in the USA in 1895 and has been well established there for decades. There is now similar general recognition in Australasia. Chiropractic in the UK is now firmly established and is gaining recognition in Europe.  With the introduction of the Chiropractor’s Act (Parliamentary recognition of the profession), the General Chiropractic Council (Government regulation of the profession) and many other professional bodies on board, including the Royal College of Chiropractors. Although most chiropractors are currently in private practice, latest NHS guidelines advocate chiropractic healthcare and welcome the practice into mainstream healthcare. Chiropractic care via NHS provision is in an embryonic stage but private chiropractic is a fast-growing profession, gaining increasing recognition. A career in chiropractic presents a very exciting opportunity for those who want to be at the cutting edge of health care in the new era of patient-centred/choice health care. It is recognised by all major health insurance providers." />
