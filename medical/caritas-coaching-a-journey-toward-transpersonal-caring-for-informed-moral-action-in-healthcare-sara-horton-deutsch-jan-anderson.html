  <title>Caritas Coaching: A Journey Toward Transpersonal Caring For Informed Moral Action In Healthcare - Sara Horton-Deutsch, Jan Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Historically, nurses have been the source of heart and healing in the healthcare system. But today’s care providers have little opportunity to make sense of their own experiences[md]let alone be fully present for others. Nurses and other care providers are often ill-prepared for the heavy toll of their day-to-day workload and find themselves at a crossroads: accept things the way they are or search for a different way.
Through stories of caring moments, transpersonal journeys, and ongoing evolution, Caritas Coaching provides nurses and other caregivers a deep, intimate look at how to integrate Caring Science into their practice. Caring Science offers a scientific and philosophical context to explore, describe, and research human healing – ultimately providing a path for bringing care back into healthcare. By integrating Caring Science into their practice, nurses can balance information and technology with the human side of healthcare." />
