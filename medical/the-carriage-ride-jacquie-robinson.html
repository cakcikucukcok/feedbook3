  <title>The Carriage Ride - Jacquie Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs a little help sometimes in running their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Carriage Ride is based on an old, Oriental model that compares learning how to manage life to learning how to drive a horse-drawn carriage. While its insights can help anyone, it has proved especially useful for adults and children with physical and mental disabilities. It is an excellent self-discovery recovery workbook&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the workbook, Jacquie Robinson draws upon her decades of experience as a mental health professional in Canada and Australia to help you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; use a holistic approach in conducting mental health assessments;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; identify whether youre letting emotions run your life;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; eliminate negative thoughts that are holding you back;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; discover how to control your emotions to get to where you want to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filled with interactive activities, the workbook can be used on a personal journey or as a tool to for small groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether youre a family member seeking to help a loved one overcome autism, a phobia, or some other problem or an individual who wants to take a proactive approach to taking ownership of your life, this workbook is filled with tools to help you accomplish your goals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
