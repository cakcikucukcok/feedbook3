  <title>Overcoming Anger in Your Relationship: How to Break the Cycle of Arguments, Put-Downs, and Stony Silences - W. Robert Nay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;		 &lt;/P&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Has your relationship become a battlefield? Does your partner&#39;s sarcasm, irritability, or hostility make you wonder where the closeness and trust have gone-and how much more you can take? If anger is poisoning your relationship, this book offers a powerful antidote. Anger expert W. Robert Nay provides clear-cut, practical techniques for responding productively to inappropriate expressions of anger. Learn how anger gains a foothold in a couple&#39;s life, why your usual responses may unwittingly reward bad behavior, and how to stand up for yourself in ways that promote lasting change. Self-quizzes and step-by-step suggestions for dealing with different types of angry behavior are illustrated with true-to-life examples. Grounded in psychological science, the strategies in this book are simple yet surprisingly effective. Try them for yourself-and for the person you love.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;		See also Dr. Nay&#39;s &lt;I&gt;Taking Charge of Anger, Second Edition&lt;/I&gt;, which helps you understand and manage destructive anger in all its forms, and &lt;I&gt;The Anger Management Workbook: Use the STOP Method to Replace Destructive Responses with Constructive Behavior&lt;/I&gt;, which builds core anger management skills using interactive exercises.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
