  <title>Living with Lewy Body Dementia - Judy Towne Jennings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Judy is a wonderful physical therapist, who has energy, enthusiasm and the best can do attitude.  She has accurately given a description of the major task of in-home care that most people cannot understand. I applaud her efforts; both the monumental task of care for Dean (who was a super guy) and writing this helpful book.  Job well done!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Joyce Dunlevy Cready, RN, BSN, Rehabilitation &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I want to commend Mrs. Jennings on the work done to put together this book.  It will be a valuable resource for patients and caregivers, and provides an honest and thoughtful look at her experiences with LBD.   It was an honor to care for Dean and I know that her work with him and in this book will help others who are going through the same difficult life journey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrew P. Duker, MD, Neurology&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book is medically appropriate and concise.  The information has breadth that is not available in other books.  I will recommend it to all my patients with Lewy Body Dementia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James P. Simcoe, MD, Family Practice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What an outstanding caregiver and loving wife to share this most personal knowledge, gained from her heartfelt experience with Lewy Body Dementia.  &lt;/p&gt;
