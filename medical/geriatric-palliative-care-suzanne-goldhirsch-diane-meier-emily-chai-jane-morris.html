  <title>Geriatric Palliative Care - Suzanne Goldhirsch, Diane Meier, Emily Chai, Jane Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The growing geriatric population in the United States has created an increasing need for palliative medicine services across the range of medical and surgical specialties.  Yet, palliative medicine lacks the resources to carry such a workload itself.  Geriatric Palliative Care addresses this need by encouraging individual specialties to own the management of elderly with the same vigor as they own other key management competencies within their specialty. This clinically focused and highly practical handbook, which compliments the more comprehensive text Geriatric Palliative Care by Sean Morrison and Diane Meier (Oxford University Press, 2003), encourages this process of learning and ownership across many medical specialties. Designed to be readable and easily accessible to a range of health care providers, Geriatric Palliative Care outlines specific strategies for caring for specific palliative care issues common in elderly patients. The handbook also provides evidence based advice for helping patients, relatives, and staff cope with such issues as polypharmacy, dementia and consent, multiple pathologies, home care, elderly caregivers, and supporting the elderly in the place where they would like to be." />
