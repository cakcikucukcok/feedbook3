  <title>Neurological assessment from birth to 6 - Claudine Amiel-Tyson, Julie Gosselin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="How to make simple in clinical neurology in the
first years of life? Perinatal insults occur on a brain
which is in rapid development. The clinical presentation
of these pathologies is thus changing particularly
in the neuromotor domain during the first two years.
Therefore the clinician needs precise landmarks to
detect possible deviancy at each stage of development.
In the first edition published in 1998 we proposed
a single and unique assessment tool applicable from
birth to 6 years of life. This first edition already included
the technical description for each maneuvers scoring
and coding system.
After 10 years of use in clinical research as well as
in regular follow-up the current edition is improved:
• research data collected at the corrected age of
2 years have allowed to identify a spectrum of
neurological disabilities from disabling cerebral
palsy to more minor signs;
• the proposed 5-level categorization of neuromotor
disabilities has shown significant correlation
with developmental and intellectual performances
both at preschool and school age providing a
link between early perinatal insults and different
neurodevelopmental disabilities of late emergence.
This assessment tool should be systematically used
with high risk infants to better understand the course
of their development in order to implement early intervention
when neurocranial signs are present. It should
also be used to assess current perinatal practices." />
