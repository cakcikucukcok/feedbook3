  <title>The Post-Lsd Syndrome - Edwin I. Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author proposes the recognition of a condition, which he terms The Post-LSD Syndrome, in which patients who have had prior experience with LSD experience a triad of distressing and debilitating symptoms.  This triad of unique symptoms consists of a sleep disturbance, anxiety, and forms of mental instability which are described in detail.  These symptoms can occur after decades of even only one exposure to LSD.  The author describes in detail a variety of case studies which illustrate the various forms of pathology which the condition can manifest.  Typical cases which consist of a fairly clear and direct presentation of the basic triad of symptoms are described, as are atyplcal cases in which other symptoms may appear to predominate, such as depression and addictions.  Situations in which other conditions may coexist with The LSD-Syndrome and in which they reenforce each other, such as PTSD, are also described.  The book is written for the benefit of the general public as well as for professionals, in the hope of helping people obtain proper treatment." />
