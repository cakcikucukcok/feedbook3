  <title>Cancer and You - Joyce Trout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book outlines what causes cancer &amp; tells you what to do to rebuild the immune system so the body can heal itself because we have a healing mechanism in our body placed there by the Lord. There is a poultice that draws out poisons such as tumors. You learn what takes away the pain. A tumor is just a mass of toxic poisons that formed in a weak area. The cancer cell has a protein coating around it to protect itself. Joyce tells how you can get thru that protein coating &amp; destroy the cancer cells. Cancer patients dont use iron properly so they become anemic. I give an all natural iron formula that works in a few days to a week. There is a section on leukemia &amp; how to treat it using Gods natural program. Would you like to know how to reactivate the liver if only 10% of it is working? Joyce tells you how in her book. There are case histories of former cancer patients who are doing well today &amp; one of them is my husband." />
