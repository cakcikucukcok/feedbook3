  <title>Pocket Guide to Crisis Intervention - Albert R Roberts, Kenneth R Yeager</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Crisis workers make split-second decisions every day that affect the mental health and well-being of individuals, families, and entire communities.  They support and guide people through health diagnoses, bankruptcies, sexual assaults, deaths of loved ones, suicide attempts, and natural or man-made disasters from the front lines.  While professions vary from mental health professionals, emergency responders, educators, business managers or volunteers such as suicide hotline workers, all have a common and urgent need for a rapid reference that covers every type of traumatic event they may be asked to respond to in the course of an unpredictable and highly stressful day.   The Pocket Guide to Crisis Intervention is a complete crisis toolkit, a trusted resource to consult on the fly, packed with easy-to-follow, step-by-step evidence-based protocols for responding effectively to a broad range of traumatic events.  Checklists, bullets, and boxes highlight symptoms &amp;amp; warning signs and provide action plans, dos &amp;amp; donts, and screening &amp;amp; assessment questions. The open layout and two-color design make this pocket guide as visually appealing as it practical, ensuring at-a-glance lookup of the essentials of managing the most common types of crisis.    More than just a collection of action lists, though, this pocket guide explains theories and models in clear, jargon-free language, offering tips for clinical practice, treatment planning, referrals, and coordinating services as needed.  It can be used as a field manual for seasoned professionals or as a training tool for new recruits and practitioners seeking to sharpen their skills." />
