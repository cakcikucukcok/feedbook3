Judges, attorneys, law professors and a police scientist all weigh in on the influence of the interdisciplinary research these forensic scientists have had on the justice system.  Featuring case examples and research conducted by the professionals who have had the greatest influence on the growth of the field of forensic psychiatry, they lead the discussion on the various aspects and issues of the disciplines impact on the criminal justice system. Dr. Sadoff and his team have set out to improve the phases of criminal procedures as they impact our community at large." />
