  <title>Caregiving: Our Labor of Love - John Patterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Caregiving: Our Labor of Love is the definitive caregiving experience. This experience took almost seven years to live through. This is a detailed account of that experience. In the next ten years, over 70 million souls will enter the caregiving experience for not only them but their families as well. This level of expectation is just within the United States alone. The United States government is pushing for in-home healthcare in these approaching years. For the numbers and figures that Ive listed, you can go to this website for verification. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK43619/ 
Let me just say that you amaze me  what a good writer you are! I really believe that God has anointed you to write this for such a time as this  and is going to use it mightily to help others.
