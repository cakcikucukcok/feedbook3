  <title>Advancing the Human Right to Health - José M. Zuniga, Stephen P. Marks, Lawrence O. Gostin</title>
      <meta name="description" content=" Advancing the Human Right to Health  offers a prospective on the global response to one of the greatest moral, legal, and public health challenges of the 21st century - achieving the human right to health as enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and other legal instruments. 
Featuring writings by global thought-leaders in the world of health human rights, the book brings clarity to many of the complex clinical, ethical, economic, legal, and socio-cultural questions raised by injury, disease, and deeper determinants of health, such as poverty. Much more than a primer on the right to health, this book features an examination of profound inequalities in health, which have resulted in millions of people condemned to unnecessary suffering and hastened deaths. In so
doing, it provides a thoughtful account of the right to health&#39;s parameters, strategies on ways in which to achieve it, and discussion of why it is so essential in a 21st century context. 
Country-specific case studies provide context for analysing the right to health and assessing whether, and to what extent, this right has influenced critical decision-making that makes a difference in people&#39;s lives. Thematic chapters also look at the specific challenges involved in translating the right to health into action. 
 Advancing the Human Right to Health  highlights the urgency to build upon the progress made in securing the right to health for all, offering a timely reminder that all stakeholders must redouble their efforts to advance the human right to health.
