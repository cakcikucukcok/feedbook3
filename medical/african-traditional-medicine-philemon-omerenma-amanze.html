  <title>African Traditional Medicine - Philemon Omerenma Amanze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="AFRICAN TRADITIONAL MEDICINE AMONG SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS:
?	Revealed that African traditional medicine could be used in the explicable or inexplicable form.  
?	Examined the veracity of the claim that the practice and use of African traditional medicine amounted to idolatry,
?	Identified the patterns and extent of the practice and use of traditional medicine among the Seventh-day Adventists in particular and Christians in general,
?	Analyzed the social, economic and spiritual impacts of the practice and use of traditional medicine on Seventh-day Adventists and other Christians.
?	Discussed the interplay between African traditional medical practices and Western medical practices in the health care delivery system of the Seventh-day Adventists.
?	Discovered that Seventh-day Adventists use the explicable form of African traditional medicine to meet their health needs because it was affordable, available and effective to meet their health needs.   
?	Demonstrated that using the explicable form of African traditional medicine to meet the health needs of Seventh-day Adventists is supported by the Bible and Ellen G. White, who said among other things that:
God has caused to grow out of the ground, herbs for the use of man, and if we understand the nature of these roots and herbs, and make a right use of them, there would not be a necessity of running to the doctor so frequently, and people would be in much better health than they are today.
