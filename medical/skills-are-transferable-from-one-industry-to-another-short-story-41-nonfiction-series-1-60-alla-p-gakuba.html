      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One Friday was my graduation day, I received my doctoral degree, or PhD. The next day, on Saturday, my then husband, Chrys, a physician, asked me to come to his office and see that is going on there. I was surprise, but went.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He confessed that he is running out of business. All his physicians friends already closed their offices. His accounts receivable had over $700,000 uncollectable debt. He already took a loan and hired 2 consultants to turn his office from red into black.&amp;nbsp; But for the last 3 month they produced no solutions, except stating that: &amp;ldquo;President&amp;rsquo;s Reagan Administration drastically cut reimbursement to physicians and that is why physicians are running out of business.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;That policy was a common knowledge, one does not need to be a consultant to knew about it.&amp;nbsp; In 15 minutes I found 3 major problems. &amp;nbsp;Chrys jumped the ceiling; &amp;ldquo;Who do you think you are? A super-woman? I have here 2 men consultant. For the last 3 month they could find nothing, and you in just 15 minute found major problems?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Seeing how desperate he was I did not challenged him. Here, on a spot I made a decision. I must put my career on hold and come to his office and turn it around. I reasoned: our children are attending very expensive schools; I am a woman, flexible, and can work in many jobs. On another side, he is not flexible, he can not work nowhere else, or learn and adjust quickly. The end result was: I turned his office around, and double his revenue.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;And then &amp;hellip; I decided that I should not go back to my engineering. Instead, I should go to work in health care industry that is trillions dollars industry, and need my creativity. So, I start working in a big HMO where I created many innovations. My greatest innovation was &amp;ldquo;Reimbursement from Medicare&amp;rdquo; that sparked a new industry called &amp;ldquo;Medicare Advantage.&amp;rdquo; This industry has hundreds of thousands employees and is receiving from Medicare $120-$140 billion per year. That was my noble innovation.&amp;nbsp; I received for it zero money, nil. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
