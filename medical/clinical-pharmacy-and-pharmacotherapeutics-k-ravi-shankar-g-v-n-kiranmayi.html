  <title>Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacotherapeutics - K. Ravi Shankar,, G. V. N. Kiranmayi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The second Edition of Clinical Pharmacy and Pharmacotherapeutics is a New Book which covers many general and important topics. The color style has increased the clarity of presentation and total information content.&lt;br /&gt;
This edition emphasizes several new themes which includes General Topics, Drugs used in Different Life Stages, Case Studies of Different Disorders, Problems related to Clinical Pharmacotherapeutics. Major features that make this Book particularly useful in integrated curricula include sections that specifically address the clinical choice and uses of drugs in patients and monitoring of their effects is an integral part of this text. This sequence of new chapters builds new information on a foundation of information already assimilated. However, these new chapters can be used equally well in courses and curricula that present these topics in a different sequence. Within each chapter, emphasis is placed on discussion of drug groups and prototypes rather than offering repetitive detail about individual drugs.&lt;br /&gt;
