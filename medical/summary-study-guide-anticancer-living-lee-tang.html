      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DELAY AND PREVENT CANCERS&lt;br /&gt;
IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;This book is a summary of &amp;ldquo;Anticancer Living: Transform Your Life and Health with the Mix of Six,&amp;rdquo; by Lorenzo Cohen, PhD and Alison Jefferies, MEd.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the United States. One-third of American women and one-half of American men can expect to develop cancer.&lt;br /&gt;
A cancer diagnosis was once a death sentence. But this has changed over the past 20 years. Recent research shows changing our lifestyle choices can (1) improve the quality of life, (2) increase the chances of survival, and (3) aid in the healing process for cancer patients.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book provides a prescriptive guide to wellness based on the latest scientific findings and clinical trials. It introduces the concept of the &lt;b&gt;Mix of Six&lt;/b&gt; &amp;mdash;the six key lifestyle factors that work together to promote an optimal environment for preventing and healing cancer. These six lifestyle factors are &lt;i&gt;social connectedness, stress, sleep, exercise, diet,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;exposure to environmental toxin&lt;/i&gt;s. The synergy created by these six factors can delay or prevent many cancers, support conventional treatments, and significantly improve the quality of life for cancer patients.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Read this book and apply the Mix of Six anticancer lifestyle changes to prevent and heal cancers, live longer, and improve your quality of life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
