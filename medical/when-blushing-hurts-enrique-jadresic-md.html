  <title>When Blushing Hurts - Enrique Jadresic Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For most of us, blushing when were embarrassed or anxious is a common occurrence. But for those who suffer from a stronger type of blushing, or blush more easily, also known as pathological blushing, this abnormal facial reddening can become physically and psychologically tormenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;When Blushing Hurts&lt;/i&gt;, author and noted psychiatrist Dr. Enrique Jadresic offers hope for those who experience this condition. He examines blushing from the dual perspective of the healer and the healed, offering inspired testimonies of patients who sought medical help and successfully overcame their pathological blushing. Backed by scientific fact, Jadresic explores the delicate balance of human emotion and how it affects our physical responses. In addition, Jadresic discusses options for treatment, including drug therapy, cognitive-behavioral techniques, and even surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frank, compassionate, and informative, &lt;i&gt;When Blushing Hurts&lt;/i&gt; offers solid information, help, and hope to those who suffer from blushing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;		Praise for &lt;i&gt;When Blushing Hurts&lt;/i&gt;, First Edition&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jadresics book, which is both meticulous and heartfelt, contributes greatly towards sharing information on and furthering an understanding of a disorder that is medically benign but psychologically tormenting, and orients the physician and the layman on the treatment possibilities offered by medicine today.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Alejandro Goic, MD, President, Chilean Medical Academy &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While reading &lt;i&gt;When Blushing Hurts&lt;/i&gt;, I once again admired Dr. Jadresics expository talent, his elegant, poetic pen, his thoughtful honesty, and his clinical ability.&lt;/p&gt;
