  <title>Integrative Environmental Medicine - Aly Cohen, Frederick S. vom Saal, Andrew Weil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At no other time in human existence has there been so many environmental changes. Over 87,000 chemicals are now commercially available in the U.S., almost all of which have not been tested for safety, particularly in young children and the growing fetus. The number and quantity of chemicals has continued to increase since World War II--and so too has the incidence of many chronic health problems, such as Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, thyroid disease, asthma, allergy, autoimmune disease, autism, ADHD, and several cancers. Many studies have revealed that exposure to chemicals and radiation in our everyday environment may increase risk for these conditions.
Integrative Environmental Medicine examines the history and changing landscape of our environment in the U.S. and shares up-to-date research and information on ways to reduce exposures and reduce health risks. This text explores the unique properties of many chemicals and their ability to deceive the human body&#39;s normal workings, affecting everything from thyroid and autoimmune disease risk, to cancer development, to developmental issues in children, and even the development of diabetes and weight gain through gut bacteria manipulation. We discuss topics of improving regulations and appropriate testing for chemicals, remediation of environmental catastrophes, and designing healthier products for the future. Finally, we discuss best practices for clinicians to ascertain exposure history and teach patients how to avoid harmful exposures and help their bodies eliminate contaminates through better dietary and lifestyle practices.
Throughout this book, we share vetted, practical resources and tools--including websites, phone apps, physician and patient hand-outs--to help healthcare practitioners facilitate healthier choices for themselves and their patients.
This text is unique in that it offers tangible, practical information that can easily be integrated into the daily work flow of patient clinical care." />
