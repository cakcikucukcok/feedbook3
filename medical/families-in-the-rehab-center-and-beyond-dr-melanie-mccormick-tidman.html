  <title>Families in the Rehab Center and Beyond - Dr. Melanie McCormick Tidman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a sequel to my first book entitled Families in the ICU: A Survival Guide, and was developed from a growing concern that families were lacking critical information to assist them while their family member is in a rehabilitation center. It is designed to ease the tremendous stress on families as they seek information about rehabilitation and have the resources they need to transition their loved one from rehab to home.
Transitions from hospital to rehab to home are difficult, and the information compiled here in a quick-reference format will assist families and patients in locating needed equipment, caregiver assistance, home health, and further rehabilitation. The information contained in this book has been used in actual practice by the author for thirty-seven years in educating families and training patients to be as independent as possible, following a hospitalization.
The book is broken up into chapters and there are places for making notes after each chapter, just as in my first book. None of the information contained in this book is my creation. I have given credit to websites, organizations, and authors. My efforts in creating this book were to merely compile information into one resource, making it more easily accessible to you, the family.
My hope is that this book will provide needed information regarding resources and will answer important questions for you, the family, while your loved one is receiving rehabilitation and preparing to return home." />
