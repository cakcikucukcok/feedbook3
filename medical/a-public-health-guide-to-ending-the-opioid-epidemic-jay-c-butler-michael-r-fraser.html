  <title>A Public Health Guide to Ending the Opioid Epidemic - Jay C. Butler, Michael R. Fraser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;strong&gt;THE DEFINITIVE GUIDE FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FIGHTING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC&lt;/strong&gt;
The opioid crisis has devastated families and communities across the United States. Changes in policing and medical practices have been swift, but they&#39;ve achieved only a modest impact on the fundamental causes of substance misuse and addiction.
The necessity for upstream intervention is clear. But what does that look like?
&lt;em&gt;A Public Health Guide to Ending the Opioid Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; does what only a public health approach can: offer credible, scalable, and empirically supported approaches to uprooting one of society&#39;s most pernicious challenges. It systemizes the core tenets of the public health approach to substance misuse and addiction, which alongside clinical approaches (prescription guidelines and monitoring, increased access to overdose-reversal medication, and medication-assisted treatment availability) offers a roadmap for end-to-end response to this diverse problem.
Core elements of the public health approach, all covered here in practical terms, include:
&amp;#183; How to support community-based, primary prevention of substance misuse and addiction in different settings and populations
&amp;#183; How to effectively address the cultural, social, and environmental aspects of health that are driving the current epidemic
&amp;#183; How governmental public health agencies play a significant role in responding to the epidemic, both in the field&#39;s traditional model of disease surveillance and control and in more directed approaches to health promotion (building community resilience; addressing the impact of adverse childhood events; mitigating the root causes of addiction)
These frameworks offer a foundation for understanding, analyzing, and meaningfully impacting the burden of opioid misuse and addiction in any population or setting. &lt;em&gt;A Public Health Guide to Ending the Opioid Epidemic &lt;/em&gt;is a roadmap for meaningful change." />
