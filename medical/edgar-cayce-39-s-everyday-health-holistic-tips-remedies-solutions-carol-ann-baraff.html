  <title>Edgar Cayce&#39;s Everyday Health: Holistic Tips, Remedies &amp; Solutions - Carol Ann Baraff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Author Carol A. Baraff has incorporated her forty years of researching and writing on holistic health topics from the Edgar Cayce readings into a simple yet complete everyday health guide full of practical solutions, natural remedies, and holistic health perspectives from the &quot;father of holistic medicine&quot; himself. Baraff has divided her book into four easy-to-follow reference sections. Every aspect of your health is covered with: Diet - What&#39;s good, what&#39;s not so good? And the benefits of such simple ingredients as gelatin, olive oil, almonds, fat (yes, some fat is good for you!), and wine. Health Aids and Strategies - Solutions and cures to keep you healthy from head to toe.  You&#39;ll learn about castor oil (as an application) and the benefits of cayenne, healing light, Ipsab (for happy gums), Glycothymoline, Atomidine, water cures and more. Common Concerns and Disorders - What&#39;s ailing you today? Check out Baraff&#39;s quick tips to feeling better if you have a sore throat, constipation, arthritis, or a simple cold (plus much more!). Holistic Perspectives - Baraff closes with an overview of holistic health perspectives and additional practical applications using essential oils, healing rocks, and breath-work for total body rejuvenation!" />
