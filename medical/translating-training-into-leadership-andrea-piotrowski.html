  <title>Translating Training Into Leadership - Andrea Piotrowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book highlights the training in professional psychology programs that prepares students and psychologists to be effective leaders. The scientist-practitioner model promotes proficiency in both clinical and analytical skills that are important in leadership positions, though the translation of these skills into leadership roles is often neglected by psychologists. The first part of the book briefly reviews basic concepts related to management and demonstrates that the foundational and functional competencies acquired in professional psychology programs are readily transferable into these positions. Specific examples of psychological concepts that benefit leadership roles are also discussed. The latter part of the book examines the gaps and limitations of skills in training programs that are important in leadership positions and how concepts related to industrial/organizational psychology could fill these gaps. Two psychologists in leadership roles are profiled to illustrate the benefits of psychology training to leadership positions and ways in which limitations can be successfully addressed. A resource list related to leadership and management skills development is also provided to supplement the competencies already acquired in training." />
