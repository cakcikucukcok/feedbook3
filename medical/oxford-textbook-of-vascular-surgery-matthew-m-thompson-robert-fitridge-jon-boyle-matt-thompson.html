  <title>Oxford Textbook of Vascular Surgery - Matthew M. Thompson, Robert Fitridge, Jon Boyle, Matt Thompson...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Oxford Textbook of Vascular Surgery draws on the expertise of over 130 specialist contributors to encompass the field of vascular surgery. Through the use of figures, findings of contemporary trials, and additional online content, this textbook is an excellent study material for surgical trainees entering their final two years of training, in addition to serving as an effective reference source for practicing surgeons.
This volume discusses the epidemiology, vascular biology, clinical features and management of diseases that affect the vasculature and contains dedicated chapters which address topics such as paediatric surgery, damage control surgery, and amputations. The text follows a logical framework which complements the published Intercollegiate Surgery Curriculum making it particularly useful in preparation for the Intercollegiate Examination.
The online version of The Oxford Textbook of Vascular Surgery is free for twelve months to individual purchasers of this book and contains the full text of the print edition, links to external sources and informative videos demonstrating current surgical techniques,  making this a valuable resource for practicing surgeons. The field of vascular surgery has advanced rapidly in recent years and has expanded to include the techniques of interventional radiology and cardiology which are
also extensively covered in this volume, making it an authoritative modern text.
By combining contemporary evidence-based knowledge with informative figures, online resources and links to the current training curriculum, The Oxford Textbook of Vascular Surgery is a highly valuable source of information and will become the standard reference text for all who study vascular disease and its treatment." />
