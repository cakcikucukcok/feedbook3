No money. No passport. No identity.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Taken to a mental hospital by the police, MacLean then started to hallucinate so severely he had to be tied down. He could remember song lyrics, but not his family, his friends, or the woman he was told he loved. The illness, it turned out, was the result of a commonly prescribed antimalarial medication he had been taking. Upon his return to the United States, he struggled to piece together the fragments of his former life.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; In this &amp;ldquo;mesmerizing, unsettling memoir about the ever-echoing nature of identity&amp;mdash;written in vivid, blooming detail,&amp;rdquo; he tells the harrowing, absurd, and unforgettable story of his journey back to himself (Gillian Flynn, author of &lt;I&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/I&gt;).&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;ldquo;[MacLean] is an exceedingly entertaining psychotic.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.
