  <title>Succeeding in Your Consultant Medical Interview - Robert Ghosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Achieving consultant status remains the ambition and pinnacle of achievement in the eyes of most hospital doctors. The stakes are high, the competition is intense and the selection process is discerning. It is important, therefore, that the interview process is understood, and that the commonly asked questions and pitfalls are examined in order to prepare meticulously. Despite the importance of this interview, it is probable that most doctors do not invest sufficient time and effort preparing for it. In this book, the following issues are taken into account: recommendations of how to prepare before you apply, visiting the institution post-shortlisting, the format of the interview panel and presentations, behaviour traits to adopt and avoid during the interview, general principles for answers to commonly asked questions, relating to factual knowledge, opinion and scenarios and summaries of ‘hot topics’ with related questions. The information and guidance given in this book will go a long way towards helping you with your interview preparation, equipping you with the right behavioural skills and empowering you with the knowledge and confidence to succeed in your consultant interview." />
