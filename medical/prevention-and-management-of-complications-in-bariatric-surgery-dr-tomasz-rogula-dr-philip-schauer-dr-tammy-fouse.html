  <title>Prevention and Management of Complications in Bariatric Surgery - Dr Tomasz Rogula, Dr Philip Schauer, Dr Tammy Fouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As bariatric procedures become more commonplace, the safety and quality of bariatric surgery continues to rise. Risk factors remain inconsistent from hospital to hospital and procedure to procedure, however, highlighting the necessity for comprehensive education on the prevention and management of their resulting complications.
In response to this need, &lt;em&gt;Prevention and Management of Complications in Bariatric Surgery &lt;/em&gt;is the first book to compile the most up-to-date prevention and management strategies in this field. Edited by leading experts, it provides sound recommendations for collecting, monitoring, and analyzing outcomes, with an emphasis on quality and process improvement. Its scope is tremendously comprehensive, covering everything from common complications, such as leaks, bleeding, wound infections, and venous thromboembolism; to rare-but-deadly complications, such as Wernicke&#39;s encephalopathy and rhabdomyolsis as well as the emergency management of various life-threatening complications, including internal hernia, gastric nectrosis from banding, pulmonary embolus, and bleeding.
Readers also learn about early-day, late-day, and intraoperative complications, for which the authors provide evidence-based recommendations for swift and accurate diagnosis, preventive strategies, and best practices in medical and surgical management. Comprehensive and accessible, this book is a valuable resource for bariatric surgeons and surgical trainees, physicians, and nurses who participate in the perioperative care of the bariatric patient." />
