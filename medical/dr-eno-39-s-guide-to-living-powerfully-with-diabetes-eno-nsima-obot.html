  <title>Dr. Eno&#39;s Guide to Living Powerfully with Diabetes - Eno Nsima-Obot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During my years in practice as a primary care physician, I discovered that a lot of patients recently been diagnosed or who have been living with diabetes for quite some time had a lot of questions about their disease and do not have the resources with sufficient clarity that they truly `get it&#39;. 
With the number of people with diabetes expected to double to 44 million in the next 25 years in the United States, now more than ever, we need to become more aware of measures to prevent or treat early diabetes.
In my experience, a typical 15 minute office visit is not enough time to answer all the questions; especially questions that relate to how to live with the knowledge needed to move them forward. As the saying goes, `knowledge is power&#39;.
  I have written in a simple and yet illustrative phrases. I have set the book out explaining the different aspects of diabetes care using each letter of the alphabet.
By empowering people with knowledge, they are able to make better informed and healthier decisions.
In addition to being a physician, I am also trained as a life coach. My goal in this manual is to focus more on wellness than disease.  My assertion is that being diagnosed with diabetes does not mean that you cannot live a life that focuses on being healthy and doing things to support your wellbeing. In fact on the contrary it is a call to embrace a wellness lifestyle with enthusiasm and an optimistic attitude." />
