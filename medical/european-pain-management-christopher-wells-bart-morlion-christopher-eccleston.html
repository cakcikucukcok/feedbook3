  <title>European Pain Management - Christopher Wells, Bart Morlion, Christopher Eccleston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The European Pain Federation EFIC is made up of Chapters of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). Its Health Care Professionals look after a population of over 740 million people in its 37 member countries. European Pain Management provides a review of the organization and delivery of pain care in the 37 European countries.
Leaders in the field of pain management from each country offer a chapter on how their health and pain care services are organized, the demands of their specific populations, the specific national challenges they face, and examples of innovations and advances. After this comprehensive summary, key experts in the field discuss issues that are pertinent to all the European nations; ranging from working with young people to managing opioids, and the rise of pain as a specialism. The final chapter
pulls together themes from across the entire book, making a call to envision a new form of pain management for a new Europe. European Pain Management provides an authoritative summary, description, and discussion of the challenges and opportunities for improving the care of people living in
pain." />
