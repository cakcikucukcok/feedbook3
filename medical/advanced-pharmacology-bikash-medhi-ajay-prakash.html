  <title>Advanced Pharmacology - Bikash Medhi, Ajay Prakash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;ldquo;Advanced Pharmacology&amp;rdquo; aimed to deliver such topics of drugs which are very important to be know by any healthcare professional, but found rarely in any books or library. Complete idea of publishing it, is to provide readers a good platform to study the rare topics in pharmacology. This book is recommended for MBBS, MD (Pharmacology), DM (Clinical Pharmacology), Pharm D., M. Pharm and B. Pharm students or any other healthcare professionals. The book is a strong learning aid for post graduate teaching and also helps clinicians or other heathcare professionals understand the pharmacological basis of pharmacotherapeutics through thematic flow diagrams and logical explanations for specialized topics in pharmacology to ease the reading. Book is divided into three sections; Initial two sections of the book deal with basic aspects of clinical pharmacology, regulation and therapeutics; also address the most recent advances in the field. Third section is thoroughly updated to provide readers with an ideal reference that covers wide range of neglected but important topics. It also provides a rich collection of material on critical areas such as medication errors, rational use of drugs, self medication, drug compliance etc. Several other essential regulations framed in India for drugs have been incorporated in the chapters drug policy, drug pricing, orphan drugs etc. Further, critical issues in pharmacology like usage of drugs in pregnancy, renal and hepatic complications, drug-drug interactions etc. are also addressed in a point specific manner to simplify the language to readers. Emerging topics in medical fields like regenerative medicine, nanomedicine, electronic prescribing (e-Rx), drug surveillance systems like Pharmacovigilance, Haemovigilance, Materiovigilance etc. are well explained. Hope, &amp;ldquo;Advanced Pharmacology&amp;rdquo;, will fulfill the demand and need of healthcare professionals by covering the important and rare topics on drugs." />
