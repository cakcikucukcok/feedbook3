  <title>Family Caregiving - Brett H. Lewis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Family Caregiving&lt;/i&gt; explores one of the most precious and fulfilling gifts of love that can be given to a family member or a friendand also one of the most difficult tasks to undertake. The difficulty increases in magnitude because many family caregivers have no formal medical training other than basic first aid. In most cases, all of their medical knowledge has come from their own life experiences with personal illnesses, accidents, and medications. In &lt;i&gt;Family Caregiving&lt;/i&gt;, author &lt;b&gt;Brett Lewis&lt;/b&gt; shares his insights and the bounty of information that he learned acting as a family caregiver for both his father and his close friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explains that even though caregiving is stressful, being prepared and knowledgeable can reduce stress levels and better position a family member for caregiving success. A caregiver should have a thorough understanding of the patients personal and family medical history, current symptoms, and medical conditions. It is critical to learn how to interact effectively with medical personnel; to become familiar with hospital/rehabilitation center processes and protocols; and to learn about basic medical terminology, equipment, and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing candid, real-world experiencesincluding his mistakesLewis provides a step-by-step guide that can enable the family caregiver to better navigate the journey of caregiving.&lt;/p&gt;" />
