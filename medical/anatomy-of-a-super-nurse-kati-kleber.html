For students and recent graduates looking to conquer the challenging transition from stressed-out student to nursing professional, Kati Kleber&#39;s got you covered.
Acclaimed blogger and author of Becoming Nursey: From Code Blues to Code Browns, How to Care for Your Patients and Yourself, Kati expands on her guide for new nurses with this revised edition, Anatomy of a Super Nurse: The Ultimate Guide to Becoming Nursey.
