  <title>The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living - Amit Sood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Have you ever driven several miles without noticing anything on the road, or read a page in a book without registering any of it? Do the day&amp;#39;s worries and disappointments crowd your mind as you&amp;#39;re trying to fall asleep at night? Do you feel stressed much of the time and aren&amp;#39;t sure how to find peace? In this book, Amit Sood, M.D., M.Sc., a Mayo Clinic specialist in stress and resiliency, reveals how the mind&amp;#39;s instinctive restlessness and shortsightedness generate stress and anxiety and presents strategies for living a more peaceful life. The book is based on the highly popular stress management program offered at Mayo Clinic that Dr. Sood developed after two decades of work with tens of thousands of people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on groundbreaking brain research, Dr. Sood helps you understand the brain&amp;#39;s two modes and how an imbalance between them produces unwanted stress. From this basis, you learn skills that will help you:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Develop deep and sustained attention&lt;BR&gt; Practice gratitude, compassion and acceptance&lt;BR&gt; Live a meaningful life&lt;BR&gt; Cultivate nurturing relationships&lt;BR&gt; Achieve your highest potential&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All of these concepts are weaved into a practical and fun journey that has been tested in numerous scientific studies, with consistently positive results. Take the first step to discover greater peace and joy for you and your loved ones.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Dr. Sood has put together a simple, secular and structured program that is anchored in science, is free of rituals and dogmas, and is accessible to everyone. This book can change your life.&quot;--Dr. Andrew Weil&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;An important innovative approach to well-being, one we all should know about.&quot;--Dr. Daniel Goleman&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
