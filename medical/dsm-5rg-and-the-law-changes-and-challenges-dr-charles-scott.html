  <title>DSM-5RG and the Law: Changes and Challenges - Dr Charles Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) is the most widely used and accepted scheme for diagnosing mental disorders in the United States and beyond. DSM-5 was released with profound changes revealed in the required diagnostic process, specific criteria for previously established diagnoses, as well as the addition and deletion of specific mental disorders. DSM-5RG and the Law provides an excellent summary of the DSM-5 diagnostic changes and the implications of these changes in various types of criminal and civil litigation. It also provides practical guidelines on how to correctly use the DSM-5 diagnostic process to record diagnoses in a forensic report. Furthermore, DSM-5RG and the Law highlights unique aspects of the assessment of malingering based on DSM-5 alterations of DSM-IV.    Special features include a summary of relevant diagnostic changes to each chapter topic, an application of the DSM-5 to a wide range of civil and criminal forensic evaluations, practical vignettes throughout the chapters to illustrate key forensic points, chapter tables to highlight relevant information, and focused summary points at the conclusion of each chapter. The reader is provided specific guidance on a range of evidence-based approaches to rate severity of psychotic disorders and a range of considerations for assessing disability.   This is the first book to apply how the DSM-5 changes will impact the specific forensic evaluations with practical guidance on how to face new challenges posed." />
