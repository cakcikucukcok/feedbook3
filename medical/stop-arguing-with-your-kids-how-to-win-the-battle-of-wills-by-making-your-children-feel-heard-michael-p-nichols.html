  <title>Stop Arguing with Your Kids: How to Win the Battle of Wills by Making Your Children Feel Heard - Michael P. Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;For parents fed up with constant challenges to their authority-but who dread becoming tyrants in their own homes-this book provides a powerful new alternative to &quot;because I said so.&quot; Trusted family therapist and author Michael P. Nichols takes on the number-one problem of parents today with the insight and humor that has made his earlier The Lost Art of Listening an enduring bestseller. Presented is a simple, easy-to-follow, yet remarkably effective way to put an end to arguments by refusing to argue back. Instead, the techniques of responsive listening help parents open up better communication in the family; create an atmosphere of respect and cooperation; and take children&#39;s feelings into account-without giving in to their demands. Loads of realistic examples help parents defuse whining and defiance and manage common conflicts with preschoolers to teens.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
