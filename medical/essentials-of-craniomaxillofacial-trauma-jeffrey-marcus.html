  <title>Essentials of Craniomaxillofacial Trauma - Jeffrey Marcus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essentials of Craniomaxillofacial Trauma&lt;/strong&gt; is destined to become a favorite with all students of plastic surgery, otolaryngology, and maxillofacial surgery, whether residents in training or experienced practitioners. Small enough to fit in a lab coat pocket but comprehensive enough to cover the essential topics in facial trauma, this exceptional manual is just the resource you need. It will prove invaluable as a quick reference on the &quot;front lines&quot; in the emergency room as well as for use in daily practice, when studying for board exams, or simply as a refresher when confronting a difficult clinical problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book evolved from the outstanding craniomaxillofacial trauma programs at Duke University and Johns Hopkins University/Maryland Shock Trauma Unit and is built on the principles and treatment protocols employed at these institutions. Contributors are senior surgeons who are paired with current residents or fellows from these programs. They share their practical, hands-on experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Packed with Critical Information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This practical manual provides essential information in a convenient, fully illustrated, and easily accessible outline format. It focuses on the most common problems in facial trauma and then provides the critical information needed for immediate bedside care. Divided into 21 chapters, this handbook is organized into two main sections. Part I focuses on basic principles for managing facial trauma, whereas Part II concerns regional management and contains chapters on injuries to specific anatomic regions. Each chapter within this second section follows a consistent format that includes anatomy, fracture patterns, surgical indications, operative sequence, postoperative care, complications, and recommended follow-up. Tips are highlighted throughout, and a bulleted list of pearls concludes each chapter. References at the end of each chapter direct the reader to additional resource material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily Accessible Format&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This handbook&#39;s design and format make it readily accessible, highly readable, and ideal for quickly locating important information. Bulleted lists, tables, and boxes as well as tips and pearls illuminate key points featured throughout. Despite its size, this book is liberally illustrated with medical art, photographs, and radiographs that depict classic problems, anatomy, and operative steps to help readers identify the problems discussed and understand the nuances of management. The two-color design increases the text&#39;s readability and highlights essential information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are treating facial trauma, this is a book that you cannot afford to be without. Slip it into your lab coat pocket and you&#39;ll find a wealth of information at your fingertips!&lt;/p&gt;" />
