  <title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation - Richard A. Bermudes, Karl Lanocha, Philip G. Janicak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Edited by clinicians who were involved with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) from the beginning, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Clinical Applications for Psychiatric Practice offers everything the mental health practitioner needs to know about this innovative and well-established treatment. It is increasingly clear that different combinations of biological, neurobehavioral, and symptomatic factors contribute to the problem of &quot;treatment resistance&quot; in psychiatric disorders. Fortunately, a number of neuromodulation approaches, including TMS, are providing more options for clinicians to combat psychiatric problems. However, guidance about how to identify patients who are good candidates for TMS and how to comanage them during treatment is scarce because instruction on this modality has yet to be integrated into most psychiatry residencies. Thus, this text fills a great need, providing clinicians with an evidence-based foundation for the efficacy and safety of TMS.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Despite the rapid growth of this innovative option, many practitioners are unclear about how best to utilize TMS. The book addresses these clinical concerns systematically and thoroughly:  &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;? Clinical vignettes illustrate how to identify appropriate patients for referral to a TMS clinician.? Discussions of treatment resistance, psychiatric and medical comorbidities, and preparation of the patient for TMS are included.? Because TMS is likely to be used concurrently with other treatments, the book explains how to best integrate this modality with psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and other forms of neuromodulation to improve outcomes.? In-depth coverage is provided on how to coordinate efforts between the primary treatment and TMS teams to assure the best outcomes during acute, continuation, and maintenance treatment.? Chapters provide a review of topic-specific literature, as well as clinical vignettes that highlight how to integrate TMS into patient care. ? Key clinical points summarize the optimal clinical application of TMS for the general mental health provider.? The evolving nature of TMS research, such as the ongoing development of this and related technologies, as well as its expanding use as a potential treatment for other clinical neuropsychiatric conditions, is also addressed. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Clinical Applications for Psychiatric Practice guides the general psychiatrist and mental health clinician on how to integrate this treatment modality into their practice by presenting an update on the current clinical role of TMS and a road map to its potential future.&lt;/P&gt;" />
