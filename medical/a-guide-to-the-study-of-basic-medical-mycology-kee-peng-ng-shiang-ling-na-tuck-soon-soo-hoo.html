  <title>A Guide to the Study of Basic Medical Mycology - Kee Peng Ng, Shiang Ling Na, Tuck Soon Soo-Hoo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mycotic diseases are gaining importance because of the increase in opportunistic fungal infections in patients whose immune systems are compromised. The identification of fungi isolated from clinical material has posed a variety of problems to many laboratories because of lack of expertise and experience, especially in the identification of recently emerged rare fungi that had not been previously reported.
A Guide to the Study of Basic Medical Mycology offers an overview of the basic characteristics of fungi frequently isolated from clinical specimens. This comprehensive guide, developed by authors Kee Peng Ng, Tuck Soon Soo-Hoo, and Shiang Ling Na from the Department of Medical Microbiology, University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia, details the macro- and microscopic features of each fungus through graphics and illustrations. 
Including specimens not often found in all teaching modules, A Guide to the Study of Basic Medical Mycology serves to help medical students identify and learn to deal with clinically important fungi and fungal pathogens." />
