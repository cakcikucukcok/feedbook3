  <title>Home Health Nursing - American Nurses Association</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Home health is one of the fastest-growing industries, expected to add well over 1 million new jobs throughout the next decade. As a nurse practicing in this area, you are going to be called upon to coordinate and deliver care like never before.
Americans ages 65 and older will be nearly 20 percent of the population by 2030, and will be more diverse with respect not only to race and ethnicity, but also to other cultural and socioeconomic factors. This diversity will impact your home health practice roles and responsibilities. Patient education and advocacy, telemonitoring and electronic health records (EHRs), quality and performance improvement, care coordination … all will require ongoing education and training. Reimbursements for home health care services and models of care will continue to shift and change as the provisions of the ACA and other legislation are rolled out.
That’s why it is now more important than ever to have a resource that provides comprehensive guidance on the full scope of home health nursing practice and its 16 competencies-based standards. To effectively do your job and ensure the highest-quality patient care, you need ANA’s newly revised publication, Home Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2ndEdition.
This is the only publication that articulates the essentials of home health nursing at all practice levels and settings and is specifically designed to define, direct and guide the practice of home health nurses.
Don’t miss your chance to get the fully updated second edition covering such hot topics and trends in home health nursing as:
• Ethical considerations in decision-making.
• Finances and reimbursement.
• Informatics and related technologies.
• Practice environments and settings.
• Research into critical clinical and administrative arenas.
ANA’s Home Health Nursing: Scope and Standards of Practice, 2nd Edition, is the definitive resource for all home health care professionals, whether you are policy makers, litigators, home health agencies, home health nurses or even members of the public." />
