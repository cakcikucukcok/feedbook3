  <title>Life as a Medical Student - Sihame Benmira</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The medical profession subjects its potential members to challenging training: medical students are overloaded with work, deprived of sleep and often lead stressful and hectic lives. Difficult as the regimen may be, many young ambitious  students dream of pursuing a career in medicine.  But is this life really all it&#39;s cracked out to be?  The truth is that little information is available on the reality of medical training.  This riveting book aims to change that by telling the tales of a new generation of medical students—students who are not afraid to say what’s on their mind, and share their views on what life is really like as a medical student.  Their controversial insights and clashing viewpoints offer a well needed dose of reality.  So read this book written by medical students for medical students and anyone interested in pursuing a career in medicine to find out what medical school is really like.  It provides useful information in an easily accessible and emotionally-charged format.  30 medical students from across 30 UK institutions at different levels of the course from year 1 to year 5 including intercalating students, give you an intimate look at their medical school lives. They share their enjoyments, frustrations, disappointments, and enthusiasms." />
