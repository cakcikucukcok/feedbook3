  <title>The Cannabis Revolution© - Stephen Holt, Dsc;Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is growing public support for the use of cannabis for medical and recreational purposes, but what does science say about the matter?&lt;p&gt; 
What we know is that cannabis contains more than four hundred potentially bioactive components, and while were unraveling its secrets, the potential medical benefits of using it remain uncertain.&lt;p&gt; 
Dr. Stephen Holt, a leader in the field of natural medicine, examines the issue in detail, answering questions such as&lt;p&gt; 
How can we responsibly use cannabis?&lt;p&gt; 
What are the risks?&lt;p&gt; 
What are the possible positive outcomes?&lt;p&gt; 
Does the delivery method matter?&lt;p&gt; 
How has cannabis changed over time?&lt;p&gt; 
He also examines diseases that cannabis might help treat as well as social and political questions that revolve around using the substance, such as whether it should be taxed, how it fits into religious practice, and its association with violence and crime.&lt;p&gt; 
Whether youre a health care professional, politician, someone seeking a new treatment option, or a concerned citizen, its critical to inform yourself about The Cannabis Revolution.&lt;p&gt;" />
