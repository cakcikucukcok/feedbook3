  <title>A Guide to Assessments That Work - John Hunsley, Eric J. Mash</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first edition of &lt;em&gt;A Guide To Assessments That Work &lt;/em&gt;provided a much needed resource on evidence-based psychological assessment. Since the publication of the first edition, a number of advances have been made in the assessment field and a revised diagnostic system for mental disorders has been introduced. These changes are reflected in the second edition and new chapters have been included to cover the use of evidence-based assessment instruments and procedures in clinical practice and the use of evidence-based principles to integrate and interpret assessment data.
This volume addresses the assessment of the most commonly encountered disorders or conditions among children, adolescents, adults, older adults, and couples. Strategies and instruments for assessing mood disorders, anxiety and related disorders, couple distress and sexual problems, health-related problems, and many other conditions are reviewed by leading experts. With a focus throughout on assessment instruments that are feasible, psychometrically sound, and useful for typical clinical requirements, this edition features the use of a rating system designed to provide evaluations of a measure&#39;s norms, reliability, validity, and clinical utility. Standardized tables summarize this information in each chapter, providing essential information on the most scientifically sound tools available for a range of assessment needs.
With its focus on clinically relevant instruments and assessment tasks, this volume provides readers with the essential information for conducting the best evidence-based mental health assessments currently possible." />
