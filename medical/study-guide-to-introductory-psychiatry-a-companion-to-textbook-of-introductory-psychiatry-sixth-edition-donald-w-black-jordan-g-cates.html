  <title>Study Guide to Introductory Psychiatry: A Companion to Textbook of Introductory Psychiatry, Sixth Edition - Donald W. Black, Jordan G. Cates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Designed and written for the student new to psychiatry, the Introductory Textbook of Psychiatry, Sixth Edition provides a concise summary of diagnosis and classification, interviewing and assessment, the neurobiological basis of psychiatry, the various psychiatric disorders, treatment modalities, psychotropic medications, and much more -- all in a DSM-5®-compatible format. The Study Guide to this bestselling text is similarly structured and written to enhance comprehension and consolidation of the knowledge acquired from the text. The format replicates what might be encountered in specialty-certifying exams, with each question followed by multiple-choice responses, including plausible &quot;distractors.&quot; In the answer guide, the question is repeated and the answer is then provided, along with the reasoning for the correct response and why the other answers are incorrect. Each question is linked to a page in the textbook, making it easy for the reader to further review the topic. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;As an ancillary resource, the book has much to recommend it:  ? Although uniquely useful for medical students, beginning psychiatry residents, and those studying for board exams, the Study Guide can be used equally well in a variety of training programs, including advanced practice nursing, physician assistant programs, social work, and psychology.? The authors of the text are accomplished writers as well as clinicians, and the book is valued for its engaging writing style and consistent structure. The Study Guide mirrors these strengths, and the resulting volume is accessible, easy to use, interesting, and highly readable.? The guide builds on the text&#39;s many case vignettes, useful clinical &quot;pearls,&quot; and a multitude of self-assessment questions, covering everything a student new to psychiatry needs to know.  The Introductory Textbook of Psychiatry is designed to provide medical students, beginning residents, and others with a solid foundation and orientation to the field, and the Study Guide is the perfect companion volume to the classic text, reinforcing critical concepts and testing retention of indispensable information.&lt;/P&gt;" />
