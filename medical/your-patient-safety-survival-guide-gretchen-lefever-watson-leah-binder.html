  <title>Your Patient Safety Survival Guide - Gretchen LeFever Watson, Leah Binder</title>

Over 400,000 will die as a result. Although most of these deaths are due to human and system errors&amp;mdash;not faulty medical decisions or diagnoses&amp;mdash;this annual death toll&amp;mdash;as well as the millions of additional incidents of survivable patient harm&amp;mdash;could be cut in half through consistent use of simple and nearly cost-free safety behaviors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Your Patient Safety Survival Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;, Gretchen LeFever Watson delivers a patient-centered blueprint on how to transform the patient-safety movement so that millions of unnecessary illnesses and deaths in hospitals, outpatient facilities, and nursing homes can be avoided. She provides key safety habits that people must learn to recognize so they can be sure hospital personnel use them during every patient encounter.
