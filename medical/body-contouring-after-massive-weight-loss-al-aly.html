  <title>Body Contouring after Massive Weight Loss - Al Aly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Plastic surgery after massive weight loss is one of the fastest-growing areas in plastic surgery today. With the problem of obesity approaching epidemic proportions, an increasing number of patients who have had bariatric surgery are now turning to plastic surgeons for body contouring to remove excess skin remaining after massive weight loss. These procedures and the skillful surgeons who perform them are now in high demand.&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body Contouring after Massive Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt; is the first major work on this important topic by one of the preeminent experts, Dr. Al Aly, and a group of outstanding contributors. This comprehensive book is filled with useful information to help plastic surgeons understand the special needs of the massive weight loss patient and to skillfully and safely plan and execute the operations necessary for contouring each body region. Each chapter is organized in a consistent format, with indications and contraindications, patient evaluation, planning, staging of procedures, operative technique, postoperative care, tips and tricks, and problems and complications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This beautiful, four-color semi-atlas provides clear, step-by-step instruction for performing body contouring procedures in each anatomic area. Comprehensive chapters are included on the range of contouring operations, including: belt lipectomy and lower body lift, central body lift, thigh lift, buttock lift and buttock augmentation, large volume liposuction and body contouring, brachioplasty, and upper body lift. Each procedure is liberally illustrated with medical art as well as numerous preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative images to demonstrate the technical nuances of these operations and the possible results that can be achieved. To complement this book, 2 DVDs are included with operative video: one on upper body lift and one on belt lipectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the plastic surgeon wishing to expand his or her practice into post-bariatric surgery, &lt;strong&gt;Body Contouring After Massive Weight Loss&lt;/strong&gt; is a must. No other source provides so much sound, practical advice or such complete coverage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
