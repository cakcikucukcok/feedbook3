  <title>Higher Life Design: Arriving at Your Intended Destination Healthy, Wealthy, and Happy - Jefferson Santos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I walked down the sidewalk on my way to the mailbox fearing the worst. Rather than a friend, the mailbox seemed more like an assassin. Its favorite target? My pride. My future. And most devastating - my credit score. I wasn&#39;t financially irresponsible, but then again Donald Trump wasn&#39;t sitting at my feet to learn any tips about money management either. Truth is I was broke. Worse than that, I was broke and in the hole. Yep. Twenty-three years old, $70K in debt, and living with my mom in her apartment. I was the essence of a self-made man. Except that I hadn&#39;t made anything yet and I definitely didn&#39;t feel like a man at the moment. Despite a large amount of entrepreneurial ambition for my new business start-up, life had me in a choke hold and I felt close to tapping out. Life held Author Jefferson Santos up against the ropes until he discovered the answer, the 7 steps that now make up the &quot;Higher Life Design&quot;. Today a competent and confident entrepreneur, Jefferson earns over 7 figures. A quarter of a million strong, his international team grows daily. He&#39;s trained teams from A to Z from Amsterdam to Zimbabwe and everywhere else in between. His house and car are both paid for by his company and in the past 84 months he&#39;s taken 107 vacations. In this transformational book Jefferson will show you the 7 step model that changed his life. What if you had vibrant health, abundant wealth, and unending happiness? What if you got the exact results you wanted? Think it&#39;s too good to be true? Think again. Think Higher Life Design." />
