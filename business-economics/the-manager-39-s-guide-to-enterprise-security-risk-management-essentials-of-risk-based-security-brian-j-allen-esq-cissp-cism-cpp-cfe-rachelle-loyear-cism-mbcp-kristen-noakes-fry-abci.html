  <title>The Manager&#39;s Guide to Enterprise Security Risk Management: Essentials of Risk-Based Security - Brian J. Allen, Esq., Cissp, Cism, Cpp, Cfe, Rachelle Loyear Cism, Mbcp, Kristen Noakes-Fry Abci</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is security management changing so fast that you can&#39;t keep up?  Perhaps it seems like those traditional &quot;best practices&quot; in security no longer work? One answer might be that you need better best practices! In their new book, &lt;i&gt;The Manager&#39;s Guide to Enterprise Security Risk Management:  Essentials of Risk-Based Security, &lt;/i&gt;two experienced professionals introduce ESRM. Their practical, organization-wide, integrated approach redefines the securing of an organization&#39;s people and assets from being task-based to being risk-based.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In their careers, the authors, Brian Allen and Rachelle Loyear, have been instrumental in successfully reorganizing the way security is handled in major corporations. In this ground-breaking book, the authors begin by defining Enterprise Security Risk Management (ESRM): &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Enterprise security risk management is the application of fundamental risk principles to manage all security risks ? whether information, cyber, physical security, asset management, or business continuity ? in a comprehensive, holistic, all-encompassing approach.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the face of a continually evolving and increasingly risky global security landscape, this book takes you through the steps of putting ESRM into practice enterprise-wide, and helps you to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Differentiate between traditional, task-based management and strategic, risk-based management.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;See how adopting ESRM can lead to a more successful security program overall and enhance your own career. .&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Prepare your security organization to adopt an ESRM methodology. .&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Analyze and communicate risks and their root causes to all appropriate parties. .&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Identify what elements are necessary for long-term success of your ESRM program. .&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ensure the proper governance of the security function in your enterprise. .&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Explain the value of security and ESRM to executives using useful metrics and reports. .&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, the authors provide a wealth of real-world case studies from a wide range of businesses and industries to help you overcome any blocks to acceptance as you design and roll out a new ESRM-based security program for your own workplace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
