  <title>Bum Fodder - Richard Smyth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the hidden history of an invention that we use every day but seldom dare to speak of. In medieval China it was cutting-edge technology. For 19th-century Americans it was a newfangled alternative to dried corncobs and the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalogue. Wits in Georgian London preferred pages of bad poetry. The sages of ancient Athens were content to wield the xylospongion instead. It&#39;s the tale of toilet paper; the biography of bumfodder. From its origins at the Imperial court of Emperor Hongwu to its reinvention as a quack remedy for haemorrhoids in 1870s New York city; from the Dutch and their mussel-shells to Henry VIII and his Groom of the Stool; from Madame de Prie&#39;s pioneering bidet to the space-age Washlet; from leaf-wielding chimpanzees to Mr Thirsty Fiber and the world&#39;s first three-adjective loo-roll – it&#39;s a story of necessity and invention, luxury and squalor, experiment and tradition. What does a submarine crew do when it runs out of toilet paper? Who stole the Pope&#39;s loo-roll? Does printer&#39;s ink cause piles? How do you fold a sheet of toilet paper in half more than seven times? What did &#39;bumphleteers&#39; do, and why? Richard Smyth answers the questions you never thought to ask about the product we can&#39;t live without." />
