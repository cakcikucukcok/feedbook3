  <title>The Candidate - Antonio Grimaldi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For decades, businesses have been happy to lose millions of dollars in order to protect hiring methods that have proven ineffective. Somehow businesses have persistently allowed untrained or corrupt managers select candidates based on their own bias and personal preference.  This practice is so engrained in business practice that candidates are encouraged to build a network specifically intended to exploit or circumvent the corrupt hiring manager.  Both the hiring manager and the candidate are completely distracted from their purpose: to place the most qualified candidate in a position that can bring success to both the company and the individual. Dr. Antonio Grimaldi has developed a system that solves this problem.  
He presents a method in which the hiring managers ask quantified questions that highlight qualities that every good employee should have and provides a framework for asking and quantifying talent that is needed for a particular job.  After careful examination, three managers score the candidates answers, can choose the best candidate according to their qualifications and depth of experience and not their personal network, education, or charm. Businesses lose money when they hire the wrong person, who is often unhappy and misses too much work, is inefficient, and perhaps even a liar and a thief.  When a company takes control over its hiring practices, productivity increases, candidates are happier and more successful, and the company insulates itself from theft and sabotage. 
In the current economy, businesses cannot continue to throw away their money by failing to identify good candidates.  Dr. Grimaldis quantitative method is needed now more than ever, when businesses are hiring fewer people, they need to be hiring the best people.  When businesses who use this process grow, they can continue to surround themselves with the best candidates in the market." />
