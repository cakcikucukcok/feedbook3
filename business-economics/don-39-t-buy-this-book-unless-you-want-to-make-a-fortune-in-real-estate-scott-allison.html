None of the information found in this book is offered in any real estate licensing course.  Only real true life experience practicing real estate can teach such valuable lessons. If you believe your path to personal prosperity may be in real estate then this book is a must read. You will reference its chapters over and over again. This is a book you will never give away. If you are serious about becoming independently wealthy then ignore the book&#39;s title and buy it while you can." />
