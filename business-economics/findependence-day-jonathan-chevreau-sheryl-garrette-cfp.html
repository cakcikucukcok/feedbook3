  <title>Findependence Day - Jonathan Chevreau, Sheryl Garrette Cfp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Get rich slowly! Financial independence
 is a marathon, not a sprint.
The financial crisis revealed the hazards of financial illiteracy. Governments desperately want citizens to become financially independent so theyll be less of a burden on them. 
Findependence Day presents personal finance in a cant put down story format easily digested by young adults entering the work force and the world of money.  Because money problems often cause marital breakups, it focuses on the financial journey of a young couple who experience the usual ups and downs of job loss, buying homes, raising children, investing and pensions, starting businesses, coping with stock market volatility and more.
The secrets of financial independence are critical wherever you are in the financial life cycle:
 Newlyweds embarking on family formation will discover the importance of financial planning.
 Debt-plagued graduates will be motivated to embrace guerrilla frugality.
 Home-owners will learn the foundation of financial independence is a paid-for home.
 Those in their first jobs will embrace employer 401(k) plans, traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.
 New parents will discover the need for life insurance and saving for childrens education.
 Mid-life investors will learn how to cut costs in their portfolios while benefiting from the expertise of financial planners.
 Those near retirement will learn about advanced concepts like annuities and Asset Dedication.
 Jonathan Chevreau is the editor of MoneySense magazine, former personal finance columnist for the Financial Post and author of nine financial books, including The Wealthy Boomer: Life After Mutual Funds. Hes active in social media and blogs at www.findependenceday.com.
Once in a blue moon, a financial book is written that should be required reading for all. Such is the case with Findependence Day. -- Peter Grandich, The Grandich Letter
 A tour de force: a personal-finance book that is hard to put down. 
 Larry MacDonald, CanadianBusiness.com
Having some fun while learning what&#39;s good for you is a double win -- particularly learning what we all need to know to live happier lives.&quot;  Charles Ellis, author of Winning the Losers Game
This revised all-American edition features end-of-chapter summaries of financial concepts learned, a glossary and bibliography of books that will boost your financial literacy  or that of your kids." />
