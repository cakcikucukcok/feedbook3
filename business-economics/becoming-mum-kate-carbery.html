  <title>Becoming Mum - Kate Carbery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having a baby is a life-changing event, and can be a very stressful time. One of the best supports women have before and after childbirth is regular, sometimes daily, contact with friends and relatives. Becoming Mum is a virtual mother and baby support group on paper, to keep new mothers going until they have the energy to find a real one. This book will support new mothers, in a society where we don&#39;t always talk about how difficult childbirth and those first few months can be. It features interviews with 50 new mothers in Ireland and Irish mothers overseas, as well as some older mothers who have insights to share. Contributions are also provided from well-known Irish public figures, including Olivia O&#39;Leary, Roisín Ingle, Miriam O&#39;Callaghan and Mairéad Farrell. It&#39;s not a book of stories. It&#39;s more like a survival handbook. It&#39;s not a &#39;What to Expect When You&#39;re Expecting&#39; or &#39;What to Expect in the First Year&#39;. It&#39;s not about birth plans, feeding routines, daily soiled nappy levels or how to deal with cracked nipples. It&#39;s about the mad stuff: the obsessive thoughts, the negative thoughts, the fear of childbirth and the effects of sleep deprivation. It&#39;s not a fun book, but it&#39;s not heavy. It&#39;s short and snappy, but the content is real and meaningful." />
