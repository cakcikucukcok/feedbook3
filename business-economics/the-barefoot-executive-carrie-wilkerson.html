  <title>The Barefoot Executive - Carrie Wilkerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carrie Wilkerson offers the opportunity to live life on your terms. &amp;nbsp;Want to start your workday with e-mail and coffee on the back patio? &amp;nbsp;Want the flexibility of joining your fourth grader on an all-day field trip? Are you ready to take that vacation you&#39;ve been planning for years? &amp;nbsp;Then you have a choice to make, and &lt;em&gt;The Barefoot Executive&lt;/em&gt; will help jump-start your transition. &amp;nbsp;You&#39;ll learn:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your &quot;why.&quot; &amp;nbsp;The most important question. Why do you want to work for yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What type of business best suits your experience and talents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to stay focused on your goal and avoid distractions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where to find the support that will accelerate &amp;nbsp;your success.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to link your business to the right market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether it&#39;s a service, a product, or your insight or expertise, you already have the raw materials necessary to transform your life. &amp;nbsp;Carrie will walk you through the process of building the business you need to achieve the life you want. &amp;nbsp;Her guidance is practical. &amp;nbsp;No philosophical silliness, no theoretical abstractions- just concrete action steps alongside insights from fellow entrepreneurs, interactive exercises, and links to Carrie&#39;s online video coaching segments. &amp;nbsp;It&#39;s the next best thing to working one-on-one with her. &amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;The Barefoot Executive&lt;/em&gt; will have you energized by the possibilities and embracing the extraordinary life that is well within your reach. &lt;br /&gt; DISCOVER what you already have to offer, how to use it to your advantage, and where to find the people who are eager to buy it. &amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;The Barefoot Executive&lt;/em&gt; will pull you over the hurdle of uncertainty and get you moving, planning, &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Others Are Saying:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;Carrie Wilkerson has done a great job with this book, and she&#39;s personally helped me make tons of money with my business. I highly recommend this book!&quot;&amp;nbsp;- Chris Brogan, president, Human Business Works, and publisher of chrisbrogan.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There has never been a better time to turn your passions into income. But just having an idea doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re ready to order business cards just yet. Carrie Wilkerson&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Barefoot Executive&lt;/em&gt; walks you through the process of developing your idea, finding your audience, and setting yourself up for a lifetime of success doing the work you love for the hardest boss you&#39;ll ever have... yourself!&quot;&amp;nbsp;- Dave Ramsey, host of The Dave Ramsey Show and best-selling author of &lt;em&gt;The Total Money Makeover&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;&lt;/em&gt;One of the best ways to achieve success is to learn from someone who has already done it. &amp;nbsp;If you are looking to build a viable, sustainable, and lucrative business from home- or anywhere else- Carrie Wilkerson is your example, and her new book will show you the way.&quot; - Tim Sanders, author of &lt;em&gt;Today We Are Rich&lt;/em&gt; and former CSO at Yahoo!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A lot of books can fire up an entrepreneur. &amp;nbsp;But a lot of those books leave readers high and dry when it comes to practical application. &amp;nbsp;Enthusiasm isn&#39;t enough. &amp;nbsp;You need a plan and the tools to build with. &amp;nbsp;Carrie Wilkerson&#39;s guidance provides just that. &amp;nbsp;Combine that with her enthusiasm, warmth, and core values, and you have someone very real to learn from. &amp;nbsp;As my dad says, &#39;a great book needs to cover the Why and the How.&#39; &amp;nbsp;This is a great book. &amp;nbsp;I know that when Carrie advises Ziglar, Inc. on marketing ideas, we get results.&quot; - Tom Ziglar, CEO and proud son of Zig Ziglar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re dreaming of building a business on your terms, then you&#39;ll absolutely love Carrie Wilkerson.&quot; - Tory Johnson, CEO, Women For Hire and &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; best-selling author&lt;/p&gt;" />
