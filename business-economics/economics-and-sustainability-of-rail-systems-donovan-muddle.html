      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book provides a detailed run-through of the economics of rail systems. Demand supply of transport is very useful tool for determining the economic benefits of any rail system, and it is discussed in detail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Externalities are common in the assessment of any rail system. Rail systems provide so many benefits to any society, and all benefits need to be counted to provide a full and fair appraisal of the worth of a rail system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rail systems are very energy efficient which is very attractive for governments and communities. Carbon emissions for rail systems are low, both for freight and for passenger trains. Building rail systems to replace vehicle traffic is a very effective way to reduce the emissions of a country or city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book discusses tourist rail systems, and their economics. Tourism is a very important part of most economics, and rail systems have an important role to play in providing transport. In some cases rail systems are constructed as tourist attractions, with strong appeal and a new experience provided.&lt;/p&gt;" />
