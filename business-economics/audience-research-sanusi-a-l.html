  <title>Audience Research - Sanusi A. L.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One big mistake rookie marketers make is trying to market to everyone and anyone. I get the logic, you think that by targeting everyone you&amp;#39;ll make more sales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But in fact, the opposite is true. As by trying to cater to everyone you end up appealing to no one specific person.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And here&amp;#39;s the thing: People don&amp;#39;t want generic, tailored to all, marketing, especially online. Every single one of us thinks we&amp;#39;re a special little snowflake that has individual needs and unique problems.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We don&amp;#39;t want to think our problems are shared by the masses and can be solved by common solutions. We believe we need a unique solution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So this book, &amp;quot;Audience Research&amp;quot; teaches you step by step EXACTLY how to find your target audience. It also teach you how to speak directly to your audience via your content and marketing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most importantly, this book teaches you how to stay motivated, stay focused, and take action daily so that you will achieve even your wildest dreams!&lt;br /&gt;
