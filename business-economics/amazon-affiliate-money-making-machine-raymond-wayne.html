  <title>Amazon Affiliate Money Making Machine - Raymond Wayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An employee doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to care about where the company is heading. He will still get paid even if the profits are down. But it&amp;rsquo;s not the same case for business men &amp;ndash; for people who have and manage their own businesses. They always need to think and stay a few steps ahead of the competition and remain focused on studying their market.&lt;br /&gt;
Amazon Associates look upon what they do as something they are passionate with&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; and not a job.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It&amp;rsquo;s a lesson that can&amp;rsquo;t be emphasized enough if you truly want to make your Amazon commissions a primary or steady source of income. You need&amp;nbsp; to be more proactive with what you&amp;rsquo;re doing rather than simply going to &amp;ldquo;work&amp;rdquo; and just waiting for the paycheck to arrive at the end of the month.&lt;br /&gt;
People place a lot of respect, trust, and loyalty on Amazon Associates who are genuinely interested in their work as well as in helping their readers find what&amp;rsquo;s great for them. The golden rule of &amp;ldquo;quality over quantity at all times&amp;rdquo; will be hard to impose on certain instances. When there&amp;rsquo;s a product doing exceptionally well in the market which you personally do not like, should you still market it?&lt;br /&gt;
Should you turn your back on an opportunity that can earn you thousands of dollars instead?&lt;br /&gt;
Keep in mind that being genuine does not mean you have to be your naturally emotional&amp;nbsp; . It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean being exceptionally friendly or business-like. You should also aim for balance by mixing in your personal reviews with what the majority and the authorities have to say about a particular product.&lt;br /&gt;
Another essential quality that the most successful Amazon Associates share is their ability to stay organized, which of course starts with a plan. You need to have a goal in sight, a motivation to reach that goal, and finally a strategy to achieve it.&lt;br /&gt;
Contrary to popular opinion, even the most successful &amp;ldquo;deadbeat&amp;rdquo; Amazon Associates did not earn thousands of dollars from commissions by doing nothing. Rather, they were just more strategic with their actions, which in return generated sustainable long-term earnings.&lt;br /&gt;
In time, continuously working with your market to help them find the best products on Amazon will allow you to predict what they&amp;rsquo;d want next. When that happens, then it only means one thing: you finally have the skills to build your own niche and explore tapped and underserved markets. You can create demand where none existed simply because you understand your market that well &amp;ndash; and they in return trust you to do what is right for them" />
