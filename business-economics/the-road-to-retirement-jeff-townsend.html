  <title>The Road to Retirement - Jeff Townsend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;YOUR GPS TO HELP NAVIGATE RETIREMENT ROAD!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether still on the road to retirement (or for those retirees already arrived), there are increasingly complex financial challenges and choices. Securing retirement income in a dynamic, often times volatile economy can be unnerving, even treacherous: one wrong turn can wipe out a lifetime of savings and planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Road to Retirement is designed to help you travel along this perilous path with confidence, knowing that you&amp;rsquo;re making all the right moves and the best decisions for yourself and your family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this informative and easy-to-read book, long-time retirement planning expert Jeff Townsend, reveals how you can determine your retirement income needs and chart a course to your financial and personal goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Road to Retirement introduces you to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, and the many other programs that can help you. You&amp;rsquo;ll receive guidance on choosing and funding your IRA or 401(k) retirement account, and how to get the most from your employer&amp;rsquo;s pension plan. The book covers tax planning, investing in the stock and bond markets, creating trusts, estate planning, and even how to plan a purposeful retirement filled with fun and personal enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Road to Retirement is your indispensable guide to making the most of what can be a rewarding trip during a long and happy life!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The last thing most people want to deal with is planning for retirement or even thinking about retirement&amp;mdash;until it&amp;rsquo;s too late. And for those people, The Road to Retirement is a terrific book. It&amp;rsquo;s an easy, fast read, broken into logical, informative bite-sized chapters, and it covers what you need to know now about retirement. I highly recommend it.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Janine Wertheim, President, Securities America Advisors, Inc.&amp;nbsp;Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer, Securities America, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;" />
