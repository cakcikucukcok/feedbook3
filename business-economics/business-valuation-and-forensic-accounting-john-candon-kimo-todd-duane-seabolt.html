  <title>Business Valuation and Forensic Accounting - John Candon, Kimo Todd, Duane Seabolt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Candon, Todd and Seabolt have written a brief, accessible
introduction to business valuation and forensic accounting to
help Hawaii residents involved in settling disputes over the values
of businesses and business interests. Most often these sorts of
disputes come about because co-owners of businesses are going
their separate ways. It may be because of a pending divorce. It
may be due to a disagreement among the co-owners. Whatever
the motivation, this book will help the parties and their advisors
chart their future course.
This primer on business valuation and forensic accounting is
designed for business owners but may be of interest to others in
the islands of Hawaii and elsewhere.
Included is a brief summary of the major business valuation
professional credentials, the related professional standards and
a brief description of the process involved in developing an
opinion of the value of a business interest. It also summarizes,
from a valuation analysts point of view, the case law that guides
the valuation of businesses in Hawaii in the context of divorce.
Forensic accounting standards, credentials and procedures, as
well as examples of certain fraud schemes, are also included
because, in financial disputes, one or more parties sometimes
suspect that someone else is hiding the financial ball." />
