  <title>On Your Mark - Keith McIntyre, Adam van Koeverden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In July, 1992, Keith started the KMAC GROUP because he felt that there was a different way to look at and do things. Those that don&amp;#39;t adapt likely won&amp;#39;t succeed. There are a lot of external factors that may prevent you from getting your idea or business off the ground, but there are also many factors that you, as an individual, can control.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;On Your Mark&amp;rdquo;, will help anyone looking to start a business or affect change in their company to increase their odds for success. This book is based on four parts: On Your Mark, Get Set, Go, and Keep Going. It is designed to challenge you to look deep inside yourself and discover what exhilarates you. It will provide you with steps to evaluate yourself and allow you to create your own personal playbook to reach new heights previously unattainable. Keith&amp;rsquo;s intent is to first teach you how to be sold on yourself, and then provide actionable ways to help you sell your ideas, be it at work, in your personal life, or as a business owner. There is a different way. This is your future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
