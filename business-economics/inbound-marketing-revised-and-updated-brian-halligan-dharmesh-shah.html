      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Attract, engage, and delight customers online&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inbound Marketing, Revised and Updated: Attract, Engage, and Delight Customers Online&lt;/i&gt; is a comprehensive guide to increasing online visibility and engagement.

This not only addresses turning strangers into website visitors, but explains how best to convert those visitors to leads, and to nurture those leads to the point of becoming delighted customers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gain the insight that can increase marketing value with topics like:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Inbound marketing – strategy, reputation, and tracking progress&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Visibility – getting found, and why content matters&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Converting customers – turning prospects into leads and leads into customers&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Better decisions – picking people, agencies, and campaigns&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book also contains essential tools and resources that help build an effective marketing strategy, and tips for organizations of all sizes looking to build a reputation.
