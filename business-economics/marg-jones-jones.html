  <title>Marg - Jones Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marg is the story of a 24 year-old Polish immigrant sex worker in London. The story is told from Marg&#39;s point of view. She is initially a masseuse who provides &#39;out call&#39; services with &#39;happy endings&#39; to clients across London - as well as to those staying in the sad, business-focused hotels of Heathrow, Gatwick, Luton etc. A husband and wife team called Antonio and Angie run the massage business. They provide lodgings for Marg (and other girls) and take 75% of her earnings for arranging clients, running a website, providing transport etc. However, Marg does not assume the traditional role of victim, choosing to work as she does, grappling with the ethics of it, and enjoying the money it brings. Marg lodges in a block of flats in Finchley Central with three Romanian girls who also work as masseuses. She has no bedroom, so has to sleep on a mattress in the lounge. She is initially studying a distance learning course in Sports, Fitness and Management and dreams of returning to Poland once qualified to build a house, start a family and live happily. But Marg is also struggling to deal with the recent death of her alcoholic father, after he walked out into the path of a British businessman&#39;s BMW on a Polish dual carriageway. Marg is about to change her life in this erotic thriller, but what choices will she make and where will they lead her? Download the story now ." />
