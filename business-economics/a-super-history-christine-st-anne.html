  <title>A Super History - Christine St Anne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A SUPER HISTORY fills a big gap in Australia&#39;s financial history. Christine St Anne has done a great job of talking to the pioneers for their inside story of the birth and evolution of the superannuation system. But, more importantly, this tale of the passions and politics behind the establishment of industry super funds will explain to many millions of Australians how they became members of a world-leading, $1.4 trillion+ system.&quot;Barrie Dunstan, Australian Financial Review In the mid-Seventies only about 32 per cent of Australian workers had superannuation. Most people left their jobs at the end of their working lives with just their final pay packet. Today all working Australians make compulsory retirement savings and Australia boasts a $1 trillion+ world-class superannuation system.  A SUPER HISTORY starts in the 1950s on the waterfront as maritime unions push for a retirement savings system that was then the privilege of a minority of white-collar employees. It takes us through the ACTU&#39;s campaign for universal, fully vested superannuation which led to the eventual passage of the superannuation guarantee in 1992. The passion and the politics around the early years of the history make way for the emergence of industry superannuation funds and the growth of the superannuation industry, a sector that was largely credited for protecting Australia from the worst effects of the global financial crisis. In her research for the book, author Christine St Anne conducted numerous interviews with pioneers of Australia&#39;s superannuation industry to allow their story to be told in their own words.  It really is a &quot;Super History&quot; says Christine and one every Australian should be proud of." />
