The cost of failing to innovate with your brand? Millions of dollars in lost sales, missed opportunities for growth, and countless unsatisfied customers.   This is not new jargon for old thinking, but a fundamental shift in how brand development works.   The Lean Brand is the new blueprint for building value-based relationships with passionate customers. Distilling years of experience on the front lines of startup marketing and the lean startup movement, Jeremiah Gardner teams up with New York Times bestselling author Brant Cooper to reveal:   How to implement Lean Brand Innovation To Discover, Create &amp; Deliver New Value  New startup marketing techniques for Parallel Innovation between product management, brand strategy, and business culture  How to optimize your branding strategy to discover, develop and build passionate customers  How startups can eliminate waste in their customer development and brand strategy using The Lean Brand Framework  How to use lean startup Viability Experiments to test and iterate your brand for high growth  A set of practical tools called the Lean Brand Stack to help you iterate quickly, learn as much as you can, and build passionate relationships with your audience  Great brands must do more than just satisfy customers; they must create passionate ones.
