  <title>Outcome-Based Marketing: New Rules for Marketing on the Web - John D. Leavy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Market. Succeed. Repeat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can you measure the progress of your online campaigns in finite numbers? What percentage of your website traffic is converted into sales? What is your cost-per-conversion rate? If you don&amp;#8217;t already know the answers to these questions, don&amp;#8217;t worry&amp;#151;you will.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Internet strategist John D. Leavy challenges you to take a new approach to your online marketing&amp;#151;shifting from doing more, to doing more of what works. Using Leavy&amp;#8217;s outcome-based strategies, learn how to create dynamic marketing campaigns integrating metrics and milestones for continuous success. Leavy invites you to uncover the absolutes behind building massive online awareness, attracting your target audience, and capturing online sales.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;John Leavy&amp;#8217;s masterful Outcome-Based Marketing is the most complete and accurate guide I&amp;#8217;ve&lt;BR&gt;ever read about succeeding on the Internet without making silly and common errors.&lt;BR&gt;I simply cannot imagine finding the pot of gold offered online without John&amp;#8217;s superb information serving as your compass and guide.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Jay Conrad Levinson, The Father of Guerrilla Marketing, Author, Guerrilla Marketing series&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;By the time you get down to chapters 20-ish through 25 or so, you&amp;#8217;ll have to cancel your cable subscription. Leavy has you doing a ton of stuff that is going to blow your business up, whether you&amp;#8217;re still working for The Man, or whether you&amp;#8217;re going to do this for yourself.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Chris Brogan, President of Human Business Works and co-author of New York Times bestseller Trust Agents&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Outcome-Based Marketing is the breakthrough book on how to sell more, faster and easier, on the internet, against any competition.&amp;#8221;&lt;br&gt;&amp;#151;Brian Tracy, Author, The Psychology Of Selling&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; &amp;#147;It&amp;#8217;s not often you read a book that is focused on results. Too often, marketing, communication, and everything in between is seen as an expense. But John Leavy&amp;#8217;s tools help you take your efforts&lt;BR&gt;from the expense line on your P&amp;L to the investment line on your balance sheet. It&amp;#8217;s a must-read for anyone using the web to grow their business.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#151;Gini Dietrich, Chief Executive Officer of Arment Dietrich, Inc., and author, Spin Sucks&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;John D.
