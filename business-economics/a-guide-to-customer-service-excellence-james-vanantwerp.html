  <title>A Guide to Customer Service Excellence - James VanAntwerp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mastering all of these attributes is no easy task. It takes a great deal of work and patience. Creating a good relationship does not happen overnight. It takes time and proven reliability. You will have to prove yourself and your worth to your customer. To do this you have to execute on requests, provide results, and demonstrate a working knowledge of their business. You will have to show an honest desire to see them succeed while providing solutions that enable their success.
You cannot always do everything your customer asks because you also have to ensure your own companies success. There will be times when the two companys goals will collide making your job much harder, and thus you will not always be able to do what your customer asks. 
In these cases, using knowledge of their business, your job is to try to present alternatives (always a good idea in lieu of saying no). If you still have to say no, do so by explaining the challenges that prevent your company from accommodating their request, but always be understanding of their likely frustration. You must always work to maintain your good relationship with the customer. By showing the significant level of effort you and your company have put into the request and acknowledging their position shows passion and understanding for their success. This will go a long way towards building a lasting relationship.
While one opportunity may not make the cut, if you work hard to maintain and grow the relationship other opportunities to work together will most certainly arise in the future. When they do, if you have done a good job, your customer will remember and come to you first.
In the end celebrate the successes and be disappointed with defeats, but do not give up. Analyze both in an effort to seek continuous improvement and do not be satisfied with the status quo.
Here are a few things to remember and it would be a good idea to write them down and place it somewhere as a daily reminder:
1.	Everyone has a customer
2.	Everyone needs a customer
3.	No customer means no paycheck and thus no job.
4.	Your co-workers are your customer too
5.	Your company and your companys customers are your customers
6.	Customer Service Excellence is a critical facet of the value proposition
7.	12 Attributes to Customer Service Excellence:
a.	Attitude
b.	Hygiene/Appearance
c.	Communication
d.	Responsiveness
e.	Follow-up
f.	Ownership
g.	Compassion
h.	Market Knowledge
i.	Availability
j.	Attention to Detail
k.	Anticipation
l.	Listening" />
