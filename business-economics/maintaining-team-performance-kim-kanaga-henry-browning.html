  <title>Maintaining Team Performance - Kim Kanaga, Henry Browning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Between the time a team is launched and the time it delivers results, managers need to know that the team is on course. Whether they have launched a team to achieve a business objective or have inherited a team, they need to monitor effectiveness on an ongoing basis and make course corrections that keep small problems from becoming major disasters. Monitoring and maintaining team performance is a key element of leading a team. You can provide that leadership by paying attention to four important dimensions: team member effort, team member knowledge and skills, team tactics, and group dynamics. By focusing on those four areas, you can assess your team&#39;s performance, zero in on areas of weakness, and take the corrective measures necessary to ensure peak performance and to deliver expected results." />
