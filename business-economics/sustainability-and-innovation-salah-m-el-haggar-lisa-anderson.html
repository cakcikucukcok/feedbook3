  <title>Sustainability and Innovation - Salah M. El-Haggar, Lisa Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One of the most urgent problems facing the world today is environmental sustainability. Current practices of pollution control, waste treatment, and environmental protection are not only hugely expensive and a burden on development but also unsustainable in the long run for their steady depletion of the world&#39;s natural resources. Any solutions must have proven economic benefits, be technologically viable, and meet prevailing environmental and social perspectives.
The main objective of this new set of studies is to describe methods that help to protect the environment and conserve natural resources. This can be achieved by applying the &#39;cradle-to-cradle&#39; concept, which aims to use materials in closed cyclic loops without generating any type of waste or pollution. The authors provide the reader with an introduction to basic concepts of sustainable development, describe the mechanisms and benefits of related technologies, and suggest potential uses on a practical level by examining innovations developed in the mechanical engineering laboratories of the American University in Cairo. Particular focus is placed on innovation as a vital means of attaining sustainability.
A timely contribution to the debate on environmentally sustainable practices, this book will be indispensable to environmentalists, scientists, economists, engineers, development specialists, and policy-makers, as well as being of interest to the lay reader." />
