      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have the Big Idea, the drive and ambition.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You see the market, and you&amp;rsquo;ve identified the customers. You want to be wildly successful. You wonder, how certain entrepreneurs have achieved success without a fancy education or unlimited access to capital. Enter Bill Green, a serial entrepreneur. Using his own impressive business achievements (and his few fiascos), Green provides the reader with the practical tools needed to launch their Big Idea or improve their existing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a unique, humorous, and impassioned style, Bill shares 101 key insights he has gleaned over a 40-year business career that began with a single flea market table. He shares the lessons he learned that allowed him to leverage his flea market business table into one of the largest industrial distribution companies in the country and how he subsequently successfully invested in or founded numerous companies across multiple end markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;His message is universal and is the ideal road map for anyone who might wonder how the Bill Greens of the business world do what they do so well.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
