      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Does the sight of a house festooned in glowing coloured bulbs with an illuminated reindeer in the garden bring you out in a cold sweat? Or is the thought of endless cold turkey sandwiches enough to make you become a vegetarian? And what of the adorable little carol singers - does their out-of-tune wailing and screeching set your teeth on edge? And the oh-so-annoying Christmas albums constantly on play in every crowded shop you visit...the jumper-knitting relatives pouting to be kissed under a poisonous plant...the freezing, dark mornings that make you wish you could stay under the duvet for ever?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If all these things make you either want to jump aboard the next plan to Timbuktu or stick your head in the oven along with the roast tatties, then this is the must-have survival book for you.
