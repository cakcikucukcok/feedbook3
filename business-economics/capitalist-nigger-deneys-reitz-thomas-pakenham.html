  <title>Capitalist Nigger - Deneys Reitz, Thomas Pakenham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Capitalist Nigger is an explosive and jarring indictment of the black race. The book asserts that the Negroid race, as naturally endowed as any other, is culpably a non-productive race, a consumer race that depends on other communities for its culture, its language, its feeding and its clothing. Despite enormous natural resources, blacks are economic slaves because they lack the &#39;devil-may-care&#39; attitude and the &#39;killer instinct&#39; of the Caucasian, as well as the spider web mentality of the Asian. A Capitalist Nigger must embody ruthlessness in pursuit of excellence in his drive towards achieving the goal of becoming an economic warrior. In putting forward the idea of the Capitalist Nigger, Chika Onyeani charts a road to success whereby black economic warriors employ the &#39;Spider Web Doctrine&#39; - discipline, self-reliance, ruthlessness - to escape from their victim mentality. Born in Nigeria, Chika Onyeani is a journalist, editor and former diplomat." />
