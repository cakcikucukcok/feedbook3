  <title>Nonprofit Transformation - Christopher Dicarlo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are over one million nonprofit organizations, in the U.S. , but very few are reaching their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nonprofit Transformation&lt;/i&gt; offers a fresh perspective on the prevailing challenges in the nonprofit sector. Throughout the book, author Chris DiCarlo identifies and offers solutions to common issues that all nonprofits face, while at the same time reframing the nonprofit efficiency conversation in order to enact much-needed improvements. As DiCarlo writes, Given the number of social issues that continue and fester, anything short of 100% potential filled is not good enough. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a no-nonsense style, DiCarlo discusses those difficult and chronic impediments that are on the minds of many nonprofit leaders but are rarely addressed. More importantly, this book offers pragmatic advice on how to push through barriers, illuminating a path to exponentially increased impact for both individual organizations and the nonprofit sector overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific topics include dealing with sacred cows, clarifying the role of a board of directors, mergers, creating a truly strategic plan, and overcoming internal obstacles to fundraising success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insightful and courageous, &lt;i&gt;Nonprofit Transformation&lt;/i&gt; is a must-read for sector leaders, staff, and volunteers who aspire to lead their organization to breakthrough results.&lt;/p&gt;" />
