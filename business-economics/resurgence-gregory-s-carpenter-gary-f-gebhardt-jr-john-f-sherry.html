  <title>Resurgence - Gregory S. Carpenter, Gary F. Gebhardt, Jr. John F. Sherry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Based on a multi-year study with several large companies, &lt;i&gt;Resurgence&lt;/i&gt; reveals how some of the most interesting and notable brands in the world have managed to stage remarkably  successful comebacks following  periods of decline. The core of this book is a smart, simple four-part framework  for reinvention,  plus compelling  advice distilled for general business readers. Yet,it also features fascinating, insider accounts of the change process, with stories from a core group of leaders at companies such as Motorola, Alberto Culver, Harley-Davidson, and others, as they considered the question: How do we reinvent a firm that does not recognize the need for radical change? Three top marketing experts bring a compelling wealth of experience and knowledge to the forefront  as they were granted extensive access to the executives at these companies and track how each of these organizations look dramatically different as a result of its changed efforts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
