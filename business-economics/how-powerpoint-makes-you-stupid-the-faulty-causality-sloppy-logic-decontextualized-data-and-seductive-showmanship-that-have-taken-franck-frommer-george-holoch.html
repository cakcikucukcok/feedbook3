  <title>How PowerPoint Makes You Stupid: The Faulty Causality, Sloppy Logic, Decontextualized Data, and Seductive Showmanship That Have Taken - Franck Frommer, George Holoch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;With over 500 million users worldwide, Microsoft&amp;#8217;s PowerPoint software has become the ubiquitous tool for nearly all forms of public presentation&amp;#151;in schools, government agencies, the military, and, of course, offices everywhere. In this revealing and powerfully argued book, author Franck Frommer shows us that PowerPoint&amp;#8217;s celebrated ease and efficiency actually mask a profoundly disturbing but little-understood transformation in human communication.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Using fascinating examples (including the most famous PowerPoint presentation of all: Colin Powell&amp;#8217;s indictment of Iraq before the United Nations), Frommer systematically deconstructs the slides, bulleted lists, and flashy graphics we all now take for granted. He shows how PowerPoint has promoted a new, slippery &amp;#147;grammar,&amp;#8221; where faulty causality, sloppy logic, decontextualized data, and seductive showmanship have replaced the traditional tools of persuasion and argument.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;How PowerPoint Makes You Stupid&lt;/I&gt; includes a fascinating mini-history of PowerPoint&amp;#8217;s emergence, as well as a sobering and surprising account of its reach into the most unsuspecting nooks of work, life, and education. For anyone concerned with the corruption of language, the dumbing-down of society, or the unchecked expansion of &amp;#147;efficiency&amp;#8221; in our culture, here is a book that will become a rallying cry for turning the tide.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
