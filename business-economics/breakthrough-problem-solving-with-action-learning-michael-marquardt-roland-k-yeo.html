  <title>Breakthrough Problem Solving with Action Learning - Michael Marquardt, Roland K. Yeo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Breakthrough Problem Solving with Action Learning&lt;/I&gt; explores why and how action learning groups have been so successful and creative in solving complex problems. The text begins by briefly reviewing the theories that undergird the effectiveness of action learning, philosophically situating readers and pointing them in the direction of related academic works that they may wish to explore. It then turns to stories of how organizations have employed action learning in solving specific, often-encountered business problems. These cases not only serve as real-world models for how action learning can be successfully employed, but also offer inspiration and potential starting points and guidelines for other businesses that face similar problems. The book concludes with a cross-case analysis that pinpoints the ingredients necessary for breakthrough problem solving via action learning." />
