  <title>Enduring Success - Christian Stadler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Enduring Success&lt;/I&gt; addresses a key question in business today: How can companies succeed over time? To learn the source of enduring greatness, author Christian Stadler directed a team of eight researchers in a six-year study of some of Europe&#39;s oldest and most stellar companies, targeting nine that have survived for more than 100 years and have significantly outperformed the market over the past fifty years. Readers may wonder, &quot;Why European companies?&quot; Yet, Europe is the ideal place to seek the key to long-term success; half of the Fortune Global 500 companies that are 100 years old or older can be found in Europe, as can 72 of the 100 oldest family businesses in the world.
Fifteen years after Collins and Porras&#39; &lt;I&gt;Built to Last&lt;/I&gt;, this new book incorporates fresh insights from management science and provides the first non-US perspective on long-range success. Through Stadler&#39;s study, a counterintuitive story emerges: the greatest companies adapt to a constantly changing environment by being &lt;I&gt;intelligently conservative&lt;/I&gt;. &lt;I&gt;Enduring Success&lt;/I&gt; provides a coherent framework, grounded in five principles and practical concepts, for business leaders who are prepared to learn from the history of some of the world&#39;s greatest institutions. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/user/StadlerChristian&quot;&gt;View the author&#39;s YouTube channel for more discussion of the book.&lt;/a&gt;" />
