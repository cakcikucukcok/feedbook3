  <title>Strange Weather in Tokyo - Hiromi Kawakami, Allison Markin Powell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;This is a reissue of a poetic, compact novel by celebrated Japanese author, Hiromi Kawakami (the original 2012 Counterpoint edition was titled The Briefcase (9781582435992); &lt;i&gt;Strange Weather in Tokyo&lt;/i&gt; is the title of the wildly successful UK edition (Granta)  
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strange Weather in Tokyo&lt;/i&gt; was Shortlisted for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize in 2014 and won the Tanizaki Prize in 2001
&lt;li&gt;This reissue will coincide with Europa&#39;s publication of Kawakami&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Nakano Thrift Shop&lt;/i&gt; (9781609453992, June 2017) and Counterpoint&#39;s  re-release of &lt;i&gt;Manazuru&lt;/i&gt;, another lauded Kawakami novel (9781640090187 August 2017)
&lt;li&gt;&quot;[In Japan] we have something called &#39;palm-of-the-hand stories,&#39; brief and strangely evocative pieces of fiction so short they might fit in your palm…conjuring an underlying, unseen world that lies beyond with just a brief description or a few words.&quot; —Hiromi Kawakami
&lt;li&gt;The two rereleased novels complement each other: both are concise, poetic meditations on the cyclic patterns of loneliness and love––one protagonist is in the city, the other is on the seaside
&lt;li&gt;&quot;Each chapter of the book is like a haiku, incorporating season references to the moon, mushroom picking and cherry blossoms…I cannot recommend &lt;i&gt;Strange Weather in Tokyo&lt;/i&gt; enough, which is a testament to the translator who has skillfully retained the poetry and beauty of the original.&quot; &amp;mdash;The Japan Society" />
