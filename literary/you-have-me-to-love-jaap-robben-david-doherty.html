  <title>You Have Me to Love - Jaap Robben, David Doherty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;        An unforgettable read about lost childhood innocence, isolation, guilt and mother-and son relationships with an AFP of 30,000
&lt;li&gt;        Mikael lives with his parents on a remote island somewhere between Scotland and Norway. When his father drowns, the relationship between Mikael and his mother transforms: she slowly starts to unravel, forcing the son to replace his father in every possible way.
&lt;li&gt;        Incredible endorsement by bestselling author Colm Tóibín: “You Have Me to Love is an intense and dramatic novel filled with meticulous use of detail and a forensic psychological accuracy. Jaap Robben handles delicate, dangerous material with subtlety and sympathy, but also with a visionary sense of truth that is masterly and unforgettable.”
&lt;li&gt;        Has been compared to The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by the Irish Times book editor
&lt;li&gt;        You Have Me To Love sold over 40,000 copies in the Netherlands alone
&lt;li&gt;        Translation rights sold all over Europe – international bestseller potential!
&lt;li&gt;        Indie favourite in Europe - Voted Best Book of the Year by booksellers in the Netherlands
