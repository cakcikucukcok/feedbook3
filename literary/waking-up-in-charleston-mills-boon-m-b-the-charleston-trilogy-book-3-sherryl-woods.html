  <title>Waking Up In Charleston (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (The Charleston Trilogy, Book 3) - Sherryl Woods</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Oh, God! She&#39;s in love with her preacher.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But it&#39;s not as if Amanda O&#39;Leary set out to fall for the most gorgeous (and unattainable) man this side of South Carolina Low Country. It&#39;s just that he organized building a cozy home for her and her children at a time when the future looked darker than blackstrap molasses.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Not even her own father, the arrogant and wealthy Big Max, would have done as much for her. But that&#39;s a whole other kettle of fish. Caleb can count on fingers and toes why his attraction to widowed Amanda is plain wrong. How can he objectively counsel this chin-up spitfire without letting his emotions–and imagination–run wild?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And now that Big Max has burdened him with not one secret, but two, he knows his priorities should be mending fences between father and daughter–but he can&#39;t help trying to build a place for himself in her heart first….&lt;/p&gt;
