  <title>Costly Illusions - Vesna Grudzinski Sutija</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alexandra, daughter of her Croatian towns favorite physicians, is hardly an obedient child. As a teenager, she lingers in the streets, lights forbidden cigarettes, and falls in love. But when she is seventeen, Alexandra is forced to leave everything behind when her family decides to immigrate to America. As the ship leaves the dock, Alexandra helplessly watches her hometown disappear in the distance as her tears transform the boat into a vessel of despair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alexandra struggles to adjust to life in a new country, nurturing her aspirations to become a journalist. Despite the perplexities of dating in America, Alexandra eventually meets an older businessman during her senior year in college. Lonely, insecure, and vulnerable, Alexandra marries Carlos and becomes pregnant almost immediately. Unprepared for marriage, motherhood, and the repercussions of living with a controlling partner, Alexandra seeks love and approval in the arms of her film teacher without any idea that what happens next will transform her identity as a woman, a mother, and a professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this poignant tale, a woman embarks on a journey of self-discovery where she must resolve her past before she can achieve happiness in her future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
