  <title>Clara&amp;amp;#146;s Daughter - Meike Ziervogel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michele is a successful business woman with a troubled private life. She has a high-powered job, a family, a husband, yet she is defined by a term of possession: she is &#39;Clara&#39;s daughter&#39;. Nameless. When Michele moves her mother into the basement, her husband slams the door and disappears into the night. Michele increasingly hides away upstairs, as Clara weaves her conspiracies beneath. Clara&#39;s Daughter begins in terraced houses and city parks of North London but develops, through sharp-edged monologues and surreal visions, into a primeval stand-off between mother and daughter. Eventually, Clara - the controlling matriarch - finds a way to release her daughter. But can Michele release herself? Meike Ziervogel is a master of suspenseful storytelling. In Clara&#39;s clandestine power games and Michele&#39;s increasingly fraught dealings with both her mother and her own highly-strung sister, Hilary, there emerges a chilling, yet poignant family tableau. Devastating in its psychological insights, Clara&#39;s Daughter reveals unnerving truths about relationship anxieties on many levels, which emerge not only from Ziervogel&#39;s elegant, succinct descriptions, but build steadily from the tense, silent spaces between the unfolding of main events. A divinely-crafted, almost cinematic novella, Clara&#39;s Daughter is at once startling, moving and intensely enduring." />
