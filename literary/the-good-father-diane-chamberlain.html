  <title>The Good Father - Diane Chamberlain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A little girl, all alone, with a note that reads ‘Please look after me’.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Four years ago, nineteen-year-old Travis Brown made a choice: to raise his newborn daughter on his own. While most of his friends were out partying and meeting girls, Travis was at home, worrying about keeping food on the table. But so far he’s kept her safe. And never regretted his decision for a second.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now he’s lost his job, his home and the money in his wallet is all he has.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As things spiral out of control Travis is offered a lifeline. A one-time offer to commit a crime for his daughter’s sake. Even if it means leaving her behind. Even if it means losing her. &lt;em&gt;What would a good father do?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Praise for Diane Chamberlain &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Fans of Jodi Picoult will delight in this finely tuned family drama, with beautifully drawn characters and a string of twists that will keep you guessing right up to the end.&#39;&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Stylist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘A marvellously gifted author. Every book she writes is a gem’&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Literary Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;’Essential reading for Jodi Picoult fans’&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt; Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’So full of unexpected twists you&#39;ll find yourself wanting to finish it in one sitting. Fans of Jodi Picoult&#39;s style will love how Diane Chamberlain writes.’&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Candis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
