  <title>Last Semester - Corine Mekaouche</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;College. Party. Drama. Life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Johanna &amp;lsquo;Jo&amp;rsquo; Gold, witty college life blogger and senior at Rutan University, decides to move in with three male strangers her last semester of school, her life unexpectedly turns upside down. While dealing with her new roommates, A.J., the pompous rich kid who feels trapped in following his father&amp;rsquo;s footsteps; Rob, the prematurely engaged former womanizer who tries to force Jo out of the house at all costs; and Drew, the 21-year-old virgin genius whose encounters with women have been more than limited, Jo learns that change isn&amp;#39;t always easy and it&amp;#39;s up to her to learn how to survive the remainder of her time at Rutan the best that she can. Along with searching for her missing mother, figuring out a clever way to pay for school tuition on her own, and dealing with the childish pranks brought on by a certain roommate, Jo&amp;rsquo;s issues seem more complicated than the average 21-year-old. Can Jo endure the dramatic perils of college while planning for life after graduation?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navigating through college isn&amp;rsquo;t easy especially when you don&amp;rsquo;t know what the future holds, but Jo is determined to conquer her present even if it means figuring out what being an adult is all about. With graduation around the corner, Jo and her roommates have some growing up to do and the last semester is all they have.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;College is complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Partying is a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drama is guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Life is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;" />
