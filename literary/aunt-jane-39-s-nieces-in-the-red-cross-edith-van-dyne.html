  <title>Aunt Jane&#39;s Nieces in the Red Cross - Edith Van Dyne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces in the Red Cross is a young adult novel written by L. Frank Baum, famous as the creator of the Land of Oz. It is the tenth and final volume in Baum&amp;#39;s Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces series of books for adolescent girls &amp;mdash; the second greatest success of his publishing career, after the Oz books themselves. As with all the previous books in the series, Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces in the Red Cross was released under the pen name &amp;quot;Edith Van Dyne,&amp;quot; one of Baum&amp;#39;s various pseudonyms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book is noteworthy in Baum&amp;#39;s canon for its expression of his views and feelings on World War I.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novel opens on 7 September 1914; the continuing characters Patsy Doyle, Beth De Graf, and their uncle John Merrick are reading a newspaper account of the end of the Siege of Maubeuge and the German victory. Both of the girls are intensely concerned with the war news; Beth in particular is a partisan of the French cause.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The protagonists are soon re-united with &amp;quot;Ajo&amp;quot; Jones and the movie star Maud Stanton, two characters from the previous book in the series, Aunt Jane&amp;#39;s Nieces Out West. (Baum arrived at Maud Stanton&amp;#39;s name by combining his wife&amp;#39;s first name, Maud, with his mother&amp;#39;s maiden name, Stanton.) Maud Stanton takes the place of the third of the trio of cousins, Louise Merrick, who does not appear in the final book." />
