  <title>Last Days of Montreal - John Brooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Montreal is a city that has always represented the ideal of languages and peoples meeting, mixing and producing a culture greater than the sum of diverse parts. &lt;i&gt;Last Days of Montreal&lt;/i&gt; travels through an imaginary cityscape, powered by apples, beer, the dream of love, and a dark but determined &lt;i&gt;joie de vivre&lt;/i&gt; which Montrealers adopt to survive the rising tide of bitter political schism, economic downturn, language laws, record snowfalls, crumbling streets and a baseball team on the verge of disappearing. The locus is a quiet enclave in the north-east end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald is an idealistic anglo from Toronto who came to Montreal on the strength of his father&#39;s &quot;Liberal&quot; hopes. But Pascale, his &lt;i&gt;pure-laine&lt;/i&gt; wife, is inspired by a messianic &quot;Lucien&quot; and she sees the future differently. Bruce is a divorced Montreal-born anglo from the West Island, a failing stockbroker and an uncertain father, who is struggling to build a new life on the East Side where he now lives with Genevieve, a French ex-pat and freelance translator. Bruce sees the blue and white Quebec flag everywhere he looks, but when he tries to explain the &quot;near-death experience&quot; his country suffered in the referendum to Genevieve, she is not as sympathetic as he might wish. She is concerned with something beyond politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Bruce and Donald represent a cry from the middle-class, horrid Last Days is their hyper-echo. Loud and legless, Last Days is a dissolute tramp, a self-appointed profit of doom, wheeling around in his electric wheelchair, warning all citizens that Montreal is killing itself with this ridiculous French/English political war. Last Days&#39; world is the downtown streets. But a fateful meeting on the Cartier Bridge sparks love. A true Montrealer, Last Days heads into the north end, in search of his heart&#39;s desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time span is from the early 90&#39;s through to a blessed spring following the Ice Storm of January 1998. At its centre is that cold, nerve-wracking day in November 1995. &lt;i&gt;Last Days of Montreal&lt;/i&gt; is emotional history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
