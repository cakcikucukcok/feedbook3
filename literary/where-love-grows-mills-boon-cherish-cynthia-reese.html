  <title>Where Love Grows (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Cynthia Reese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;When Becca Reynolds heads for rural Georgia to investigate a suspected crop insurance scam, she&#39;s concerned about her career, not her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chief among the suspects is handsome Ryan MacIntosh, who isn&#39;t telling everything he knows. Could his involvement possibly be deeper than his devotion to his grandmother and the small farm that&#39;s been in the family for generations?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Becca can&#39;t be sure, even though she knows Ryan intimately–at least online. She&#39;s certain he&#39;s the charming stranger with whom she&#39;s exchanged countless e-mails–and fallen in love. But she can&#39;t admit the truth any more than Ryan can–nor predict what it will cost them in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
