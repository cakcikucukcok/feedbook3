      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner, 2017 Quebec Writers’ Federation Concordia University First Book Prize&lt;br&gt;Shortlisted, 2017 Governor General&#39;s Award for Fiction&lt;br&gt;Shortlisted, 2018 Kobo Emerging Writer Prize&lt;br&gt;Named a Favourite Book of 2017 by &lt;i&gt;The National Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moscow, 1921. Tatiana and Sasha meet in a bookstore the night it is bombed. In the aftermath of the explosion, Sasha grabs Tatiana&#39;s hand and together they run to safety. They fall in love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A promising young scientist, Tatiana follows her mentor, Dr. Bekhterev, to the Institut Mozga, established to study the source of genius. She thrives in the state-sponsored research institute, but Sasha, an artist, feels left behind in this new world where his art seems without place or function. A rift between them grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Bekhterev suddenly dies, Tatiana is prompted to speculate about the shadowy circumstances of his death. Disconcerted and unable to find answers to her questions, she plunges into doubt &amp;#8212; about her work as a scientist, her naiveté about the Revolution, her faith in the state, and her relationship with Sasha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Provocative and compelling, &lt;i&gt;Uncertain Weights and Measures&lt;/i&gt; takes place in the heady days of post-Revolution Russia, when belief in a higher purpose was everything. Written in beautifully incisive prose, Jocelyn Parr vividly captures the ambiance of 1920s Moscow and the frisson of real-life events while also spinning a captivating tale of a love torn apart by ideology and high-stakes politics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
