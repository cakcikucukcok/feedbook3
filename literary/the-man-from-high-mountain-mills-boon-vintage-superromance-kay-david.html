          &lt;strong&gt;Cole Reynolds is an outsider.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He&#39;s lived in High Mountain all his life but never felt he belonged. That&#39;s okay, though. He&#39;s a man who likes his space–and in West Texas there&#39;s plenty of it.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But everything changed the day he met Taylor Matthews. He was guiding Taylor and her husband through a remote part of the desert when someone shot at them. Cole and Taylor were wounded and her husband was killed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now Taylor&#39;s back–determined to find out what really happened. And like it or not, Cole knows he has to keep her safe….&lt;/p&gt;
