  <title>On the Other Hand - June McCullough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nina Andrews is a woman who loves her life and considers it close to perfect. After twenty-eight years of marriage, she is still in love with her husband, Mike. Now that they are empty-nesters, they are looking forward to retirement and a life of leisure. 
Their financial planner, Pat McDermott, is successful professionally, but her personal life has been a disappointment. She has always admired the relationship that Mike and Nina have and envies them.
Suddenly everything changes when Mike dies leaving Nina behind. Her overwhelming grief soon turns to anger and then depression. She tries to live outside her grief, but the next step seems impossible. Just when Nina thinks she is learning to endure, she crashes.  
As Nina struggles with her loss, Pat battles her own demons. Once burned by love, she is hesitant to open her life up to new possibilities. So when someone special appears in her life, every instinct tells her to be afraid. But whether she wants to or not, she is falling in love. 
Crushed by her grief, Nina carefully plans her suicide but just as she is about to carry out her plan, there is a knock at her door. The visitor she finds on the other side will change her life in ways she never dared dream." />
