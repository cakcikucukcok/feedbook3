  <title>Five Bells - Gail Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Picador Paperback Original &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a radiant day in Sydney, four adults converge on Circular Quay, site of the iconic Opera House and the Sydney Harbor Bridge. Crowds of tourists mix with the locals, enjoying the glorious surroundings and the play of light on water. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just as Circular Quay resonates with Australia&#39;s past, each of the four carries a complicated history from elsewhere. Each person is haunted by past secrets and guilt. Ellie is preoccupied by her sexual experiences as a girl, James by a tragedy for which he feels responsible, Catherine by the loss of her beloved brother in Dublin, and Pei Xing by her imprisonment during China&#39;s Cultural Revolution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told over the course of a single Saturday, &lt;i&gt;Five Bells&lt;/i&gt; describes four lives that come to share not only a place and a time but also mysterious patterns and ambiguous symbols, including a barely glimpsed fifth figure, a young child. By nightfall, when Sydney is drenched in a summer rainstorm, each life will have been transformed by the events of this day.&lt;/p&gt;" />
