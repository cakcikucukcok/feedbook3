  <title>Beyond Compare (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was a mistake. It just had to be. Surely Howard would come to his senses and realize Holly was the one for him. When he did, she&#39;d be waiting.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, though, Holly Witchell was determined to make Howard Neston appreciate what he had lost in jilting her for her glamorous schoolmate, Rosamund. And who better than Drew Hammond to help her – after all, Rosamund had jilted Drew to become engaged to Howard.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It seemed logical for Holly and Drew to pretend to be lovers while they waited for their real loves to change their minds…&lt;/p&gt;
