  <title>God Doesn&#39;t Love Us All the Same - Nina Guilbeau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Book Club Fiction- Janine Harris never really thought about homeless people. She barely even notices them as she passes them by on her way to work in downtown Washington D.C. All Janine can focus on is the shambles of her own young life, afraid that she will never be able to get past the painful mistakes she has made. However, all of that changes on a snowy evening in December when Janine unexpectedly finds herself alone with Vera, an old, homeless woman who seems to need her help. Now Janine wants to know what could have possibly happened to Vera to leave her so broken and alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As Vera shares her life story with Janine, the two women form an unusual bond and begin a journey that changes both of their lives forever. Reluctantly, they each confront their own past and, in the process, discover the true meaning of sacrifice, family and love. Although to truly move forward in their lives, they must face the most difficult challenge of all &amp;ndash; forgiving themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
