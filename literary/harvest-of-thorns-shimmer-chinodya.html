  <title>Harvest of Thorns - Shimmer Chinodya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 1990 Commonwealth Writers Regional Prize voted Harvest of Thorns the winner in the Best Book category. Harvest of Thorns tells the story of Benjamin Tichafa who grows up in Rhodesia in the 1960s. From a conservative, religious family, but exposed to the heady ideas of the black nationalist movements, the young student is pulled in different directions. Isolated and troubled at boarding school, he is provoked into leaving, making his way to Mozambique, and joining the freedom fighters. There, in the crucible of a bitter civil war of liberation, the young man develops into manhood. Returning, hardened, at independence, he feels that little has changed, not least within his own family circumstances, and asks himself what it means to be free in the new Zimbabwe." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Harvest of Thorns - Shimmer Chinodya</i></b> | Shimmer Chinodya identifies the growth of oneself in a more hostile environment, the liberation wars of Zimbabwe in the late 1970's. The main character Benjamin revolts against his families' norms, of living a content quiet life, collobrating with the oppresive system of Rhodesian Apartheid.<br /><b><i>Harvest of Thorns by Shimmer Chinodya - Goodreads</i></b> | In Shimmer Chinodya's `Harvest of Thorns' we are shown the glories of revolution along with the darkest costs in them. We are torn in thinking that perhaps the cost is too dire and severe. We are shown the inadequacies of humanity.<br /><b><i>Harvest of Thorns: Chinodya, Shimmer: 9781779223272 ...</i></b> | â€œZimbabwe has fine black writers and Shimmer Chinodya is one of the best. Harvest of Thorns brilliantly pictures the transition between the old white dominated Southern Rhodesia, through the Bush War, to the new black regime. It is a brave book, a good strong story, and it is often very funny.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Harvest of Thorns - Shimmer Chinodya</a> </h3></p><hr/>
