  <title>What To Keep (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Mary Schramski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She&#39;d never had a real home…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So it had never been about &quot;what to keep&quot; in her life; she&#39;d not experienced that luxury. Then Juliette Carlton got a call, one that said she&#39;d inherited a fortune–and could she please claim it? Juliette didn&#39;t know what to do. She was a down-on-her-luck Las Vegas card dealer with $38 in her bank account.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Had she hit the jackpot? Or was it just another loss?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At first it seemed the latter. The &quot;fortune&quot; was a dilapidated 140-year-old antebellum house that belonged to an uncle she barely remembered. Beneath layers of dust, every inch of the ancestral home was shrouded in secrets–secrets that would put in doubt everything Juliette ever thought she knew.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She would have to decide what to give away. But along the way, she found what to keep….&lt;/p&gt;
