  <title>Like a Dog - Tara Jepsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paloma, a skateboarder in her early 30s, is a free-spirited young woman living on the margins, aimlessly working at low-paying jobs and finding happiness in disreputable places. She struggles to have a relationship with her brother Peter, whose self-destructive drug addiction makes that nearly impossible&amp;mdash;death by overdose is a constant threat, and Peter&#39;s irresponsible, erratic behavior often disrupts any attempt to spend time together. And yet, despite the pain of navigating a distressing sibling relationship and the havoc it wreaks on her emotional life, Paloma&#39;s outlook is generally playful and irreverent. Ruminating on the human condition as she daydreams about becoming a stand-up comedian, she offers up her philosophy on life: &quot;Why can&#39;t we humans be more like dogs &amp;hellip; wouldn&#39;t it be great if all a mother wanted was a butt scratch?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she lands a job with a local landscaper, Paloma finds herself enjoying the work and the casual, friendly relationship with her new boss. But Peter has connections with a pot grower in Humboldt County, and when he offers to bring Paloma into the operation she quits her job and begins to shine in her new role as a weed broker for celebrity clients. Making good money for the first time in her life, she suddenly has the freedom to consider her dream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Tara Jepsen&lt;/B&gt; is a writer and actor living in Los Angeles. She&#39;s appeared in the award-winning series, &lt;I&gt;Transparent&lt;/I&gt;, and her writing has been published by &lt;I&gt;The Believer&lt;/I&gt; and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
