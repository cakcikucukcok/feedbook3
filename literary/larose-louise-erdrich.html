  <title>LaRose - Louise Erdrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award in Fiction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalist for the 2017 PEN Faulkner Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this literary masterwork, Louise Erdrich, the bestselling author of the National Book Award-winning&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Round House&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;and the &lt;em&gt;Pulitzer Prize&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;nominee&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Plague of Doves&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;wields her breathtaking narrative magic in an emotionally haunting contemporary tale of a tragic accident, a demand for justice, and a profound act of atonement with ancient roots in Native American culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Dakota, late summer, 1999. Landreaux Iron stalks a deer along the edge of the property bordering his own. He shoots with easy confidence&amp;#8212;but when the buck springs away, Landreaux realizes he&amp;#8217;s hit something else, a blur he saw as he squeezed the trigger. When he staggers closer, he realizes he has killed his neighbor&amp;#8217;s five-year-old son, Dusty Ravich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The youngest child of his friend and neighbor, Peter Ravich, Dusty was best friends with Landreaux&amp;#8217;s five-year-old son, LaRose. The two families have always been close, sharing food, clothing, and rides into town; their children played together despite going to different schools; and Landreaux&amp;#8217;s wife, Emmaline, is half sister to Dusty&amp;#8217;s mother, Nola. Horrified at what he&amp;#8217;s done, the recovered alcoholic turns to an Ojibwe tribe tradition&amp;#8212;the sweat lodge&amp;#8212;for guidance, and finds a way forward. Following an ancient means of retribution, he and Emmaline will give LaRose to the grieving Peter and Nola. &amp;#8220;Our son will be your son now,&amp;#8221; they tell them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LaRose is quickly absorbed into his new family. Plagued by thoughts of suicide, Nola dotes on him, keeping her darkness at bay. His fierce, rebellious new &amp;#8220;sister,&amp;#8221; Maggie, welcomes him as a coconspirator who can ease her volatile mother&amp;#8217;s terrifying moods. Gradually he&amp;#8217;s allowed shared visits with his birth family, whose sorrow mirrors the Raviches&amp;#8217; own. As the years pass, LaRose becomes the linchpin linking the Irons and the Raviches, and eventually their mutual pain begins to heal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a vengeful man with a long-standing grudge against Landreaux begins raising trouble, hurling accusations of a cover-up the day Dusty died, he threatens the tenuous peace that has kept these two fragile families whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspiring and affecting,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;LaRose&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a powerful exploration of loss, justice, and the reparation of the human heart, and an unforgettable, dazzling tour de force from one of America&amp;#8217;s most distinguished literary masters.&lt;/p&gt;" />
