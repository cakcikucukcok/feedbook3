  <title>By the Shore - Galaxy Craze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Published to great international acclaim, Galaxy Craze&#39;s best-selling debut, By the Shore, launched a young actress into literary fame. In clear and sparkling prose, her novel evokes a fragile, bittersweet world of youth on the cusp of adulthood and &quot;captures perfectly the hopes and hurts of childhood&quot; (The New York Times Book Review). Twelve-year-old May lives in a less than thriving oceanfront bed-and-breakfast run by her single mother. Her life is filled with the frustrations and promise of youth, complicated by a loving if distracted young mother who strives to care for her two children without forfeiting fun and passion. May puts her faith in the things that elude her - her absent father, the London city life left behind, the acceptance of the popular girls who have boyfriends -- and wonders if her life will ever change. When a kindly writer and his glamorous editor come to lodge in the weeks before Christmas, opportunities are in the air. But then May&#39;s playboy father, estranged from the family for years, drops in and threatens to freeze the delicate new possibilities stirring in all their lives.&lt;/div&gt;" />
