  <title>An Apache Princess - Charles King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="U.S. soldier Charles King first saw the battlefield during the American Indian Wars and, by 1898, had worked his way up to the rank of Brigadier General. After retirement, the battle-scarred veteran turned his attention to literature, penning dozens of action-packed novels, stories, and screenplays. An Apache Princess recounts the tale of a grizzled lieutenant whose daring exploits on the battlefield are bested only by his romantic entanglements with a handful of markedly different women.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Charles King (October 12, 1844 &amp;ndash; March 17, 1933) was an American soldier and a distinguished writer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Born in New York capital, Albany, King was the son of Civil War general Rufus King, grandson of Columbia University president Charles King, and great grandson of Rufus King, who was one the signers of the United States Constitution on September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia. He graduated from West Point in 1866 and served in the Army during the Indian Wars under George Crook. He was wounded in the arm and head during the Battle of Sunset Pass forcing his retirement from the regular army as a captain in 1879. During this time he became acquainted with Buffalo Bill Cody. King would later write scripts for several of Cody&amp;#39;s silent films. He also served in the Wisconsin National Guard from 1882 until 1897, becoming Adjutant General in 1895." />
