        &lt;p&gt;HEIRESS ON THE RUN&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A few white lies and Grace Haley had herself a waitressing job at Tyler&#39;s Bar &amp; Grill. It wasn&#39;t that she didn&#39;t have enough experience. As heir to the nine top-grossing Chicago restaurants, she knew her way around a kitchen. But Grace was in trouble and couldn&#39;t risk leaking her true identity to anyone. Not even her gorgeous new boss….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tyler knew Grace had a secret she wouldn&#39;t share, but that didn&#39;t stop him from fantasizing about getting her alone after hours. Unluckily for him, she seemed hell-bent on keeping their kisses to a minimum. But as the flames of passion overtook them, Tyler couldn&#39;t help wondering whether her secret past would forever keep them apart….&lt;/p&gt;
