  <title>I’Ll Always Be with You - Violetta Armour</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since the horrific night a drunk driver slammed into their car during his driving lesson, young Teddy has had to live with the memory of seeing his beloved father, Stan, die. Now just sixteen, he carries both sorrow and survivors guilt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerned for her grieving son, Mary decides to put as much distance as she can between Teddy and the nightmarish Phoenix intersection that claimed Stans life. She moves the family to Stans small Indiana hometown, a place of peace in which she hopes they can build new memories. There, Teddy finds inspiration in an old book his great-grandfather carried with him to America, a book Bulgarian fathers have always read to their sons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is Stan reaching out to his son from the grave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mary also makes an equally life-changing discovery in the small townRosetta, Stans high school sweetheart. The deeper Mary digs, the more she learns of the forbidden love Stan and Rosetta shared. During the Civil Rights Movement, they dared to reach out for love across racial lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as their three lives intertwine, Teddy, Mary, and Rosetta must make difficult choices. Will they choose happiness? Or will old pains cause them to live as victims of circumstances?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 1912 on Ellis Island and told in three voices over four generations, Ill Always Be with You is a profound celebration of the power of family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
