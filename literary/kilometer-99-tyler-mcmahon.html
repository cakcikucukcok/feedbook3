  <title>Kilometer 99 - Tyler McMahon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Malia needs to leave El Salvador. A surfer and aspiring engineer, she came to Central America as a Peace Corps volunteer and fell in love with Ben. Malia&#39;s past year has been perfect: her weeks spent building a much-needed aqueduct in the countryside, and her weekends spent with Ben, surfing point-breaks in the nearby port city of La Libertad. Suddenly, a major earthquake devastates the country and brings an abrupt end to her work. Ben and Malia decide to move on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now free of obligations, they have an old car, a wad of cash, surfboards, and rough plans for an epic trip through South America. Just as they&#39;re about to say goodbye to their gritty and beloved Salvadoran beach town, a mysterious American surfer known only as Pelochucho shows up--spouting grandiose plans and persuading them to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days become weeks; documents go missing; money gets tight. Suddenly, Ben and Malia can&#39;t leave. Caught between bizarre real estate offers, suspect drug deals, and internal jealousies, this unlikely band of surfers, aid-workers, and opportunists all struggle to find their way through a fallen world, in &lt;i&gt;Kilometer 99 &lt;/i&gt;by Tyler McMahon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
