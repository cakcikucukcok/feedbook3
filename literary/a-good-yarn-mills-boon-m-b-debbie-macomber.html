  <title>A Good Yarn (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Debbie Macomber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of Maeve Binchy&#39; – &lt;em&gt;Candis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;NO.1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When times are tough, confiding in friends can change your life. Cancer survivor Lydia’s business is thriving but her dream-man’s ex is threatening their relationship… Retired, self-contained Elise has lost everything and lives with her daughter, but still has disturbingly strong feelings for her gambling ex-husband.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nervous Bethanne is an unwilling divorcée whose husband left her and their children for a younger woman. She urgently needs a job, but has she the confidence to find one? Lonely teenager Courtney feels abandoned too.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Grieving over her mother’s death, she has put on weight and dreads starting a new school. This uplifting, heart-warming story proves that however bleak the future may look, the importance of friendship should never be underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt; Make time for friends. Make time for Debbie Macomber.&lt;/em&gt;
