  <title>59 Glass Bridges - Steven Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;59 Glass Bridges&lt;/i&gt;, an unnamed narrator travels through a maze that is at once mutable and immutable: walls fall to vine-filled forests, hallways to rivers, bridges to lamp-lit boats. What remains is the desire to escape. He is led along his harrowing path by Willow, a mysterious figure who cajoles him and responds to questions in a winking sphinx-like manner, with answers that are often more baffling than clear. Interspersed are the memories of the narrator, of his childhood and adolescence, and of his grandmother, a wise artist who at once pushes his creativity, while leaving him the freedom to craft his own journey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Playing with the imagery and landscapes reminiscent of Dante Alighieri&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Divine Comedy&lt;/i&gt;, Steven Peters&#39; debut reveals how pivotal moments in our lives give substance and shape to the labyrinths in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;59 Glass Bridges&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Peters offers a strangely compelling tale of postmodern disorientation and salvation, one with roots in a past that it acknowledges as authoritative, but to whose authority it refuses to surrender definitive interpretive prerogative. This is a powerful work from an extremely promising writer.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Stephen Dunning, &lt;i&gt;Canadian Literature&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;59 Glass Bridges&lt;/i&gt; is, by far, one of the most memorable reads I&#39;ve enjoyed in a long time.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Deborah Vail, &lt;i&gt;PRISM international&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;59 Glass Bridges&lt;/i&gt; is pleasingly raw and exuberant in its execution...&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Aaron Shepard, &lt;i&gt;The Malahat Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
