  <title>A Passionate Proposal (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) - Emilie Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After drowning in a slow-burning kiss with Tracy Sullivan at their high school reunion, an enamored Cort Lander realized she&#39;d blossomed from a bookworm into a sultry beauty with a body made for lovin&#39;. &lt;em&gt;His lovin&#39;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Whoa! That wasn&#39;t what the doctor ordered. Now that he had a baby boy in tow, the ambitious bachelor had taken a brief leave of absence from his prestigious medical residency to get his life together in his rural Texas hometown. Hiring Tracy as his son&#39;s temporary nanny was one thing, but embarking on an explosive no-strings-attached summer fling was quite another.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As they burst into flames in the bedroom and bonded as a family on the homefront, would Cort sacrifice his love for a small-town girl to follow his big-city dreams?&lt;/p&gt;
