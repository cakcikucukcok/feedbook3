  <title>Wanting His Child (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finally free to follow her heart, Verity Maitland has returned home. Home to Silas Stevens, her first and only love. It&#39;s evident he&#39;s still bitter about her choosing a career over marriage. But what of his own betrayal?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After declaring undying love for her, he obviously hadn&#39;t waited before taking another woman to his bed. His daughter is clear proof! The motherless, defiant young girl touches Verity&#39;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Can she persuade Silas that she would make a good mother to this child, the child she so wanted to give him?&lt;/p&gt;
