  <title>East Lynne - Ellen Wood, Elisabeth Jay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Coward!  Sneak!  May good men shun him, from henceforth! may his Queen refuse to receive him!  You, an earl&#39;s daughter! Oh, Isabel!  How utterly you have lost yourself!&#39;
When the aristocratic Lady Isabel abandons her husband and children for her wicked seducer, more is at stake than moral retribution. Ellen Wood played upon the anxieties of the Victorian middle classes who feared a breakdown of the social order as divorce became more readily available and promiscuity threatened the sanctity of the family. In her novel the simple act of hiring a governess raises the spectres of murder, disguise, and adultery.  Her sensation novel was devoured by readers from
the Prince of Wales to Joseph Conrad and continued to fascinate theatre-goers and cinema audiences well into the next century.
This edition returns for the first time to the racy, slang-ridden narrative of the first edition, rather than the subsequent stylistically &#39;improved&#39; versions hitherto reproduced by modern editors.
ABOUT THE SERIES: For over 100 years Oxford World&#39;s Classics has made available the widest range of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford&#39;s commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, helpful notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more." />
