  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>An Infamous Army - Georgette Heyer</i></b> | An Infamous Army is a novel by Georgette Heyer. In this novel Heyer combines her penchant for meticulously researched historical novels with her more popular period romances. So in addition to being a Regency romance, it is one of the most historically accurate and vividly narrated descriptions of the Battle of Waterloo.<br /><b><i>An Infamous Army - Wikipedia</i></b> | This book 'An Infamous Army' was part of the O-Level History curriculum when I was at school (not doing history). Reading it again, where a lot of the descriptions of the Battle of Waterloo are taken from first hand accounts and despatches you realise both how relentless and terrible the battle must have been and what a lot of scholarship Heyer put in to her work.<br /><b><i>An Infamous Army: A Novel of Wellington, Waterloo, Love ...</i></b> | An Infamous Army, sometimes described as the third book in Georgette Heyer's Alastair Trilogy, is actually the sequel to a number of the author's earlier works, bringing together characters from three different storylines. The tale of dazzling Lady Barbara Childe, and her tempestuous engagement to Colonel Charles Audley, it is also the story of the prelude to, and conduct of, the famous battle of Waterloo.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>An Infamous Army - Georgette Heyer</a> </h3></p><hr/>
