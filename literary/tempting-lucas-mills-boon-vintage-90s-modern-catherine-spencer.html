          &lt;strong&gt;Resisting sin with Dr. Flynn Lucas Flynn was still a dish, as tempting as he had been eleven years before when Emily had placed her naive teenage self in his bed and let him seduce her.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Those years hadn&#39;t made Lucas any more kindly disposed to Emily - who longed to tell him about the consequences of their one-night stand, and that she&#39;d never stopped wanting him. But this time she wasn&#39;t going to offer herself to him on a plate. If Lucas ever made love to Emily again, it would be because he had come to her!&lt;/p&gt;
