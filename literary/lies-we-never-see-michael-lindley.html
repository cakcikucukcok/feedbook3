  <title>Lies We Never See - Michael Lindley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A compelling story of historical fiction and present-day mystery and suspense from Amazon Kindle #1 author, Michael Lindley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hanna Walsh&amp;rsquo;s husband is found murdered in Charleston, South Carolina. His failed land deal leaves her family and finances in ruins. The FBI thinks she knows more than she&amp;rsquo;s letting on and a dangerous stranger thinks she&amp;rsquo;s hiding several million dollars he wants back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An old letter and journal found in the attic of the family&amp;rsquo;s beach house on Pawley&amp;rsquo;s Island reveals her distant grandmother, who owned the same house as a young widow during the Civil War, suffered similar travails of emotional loss and financial hardship. Her grandmother&amp;rsquo;s story chronicles the tragic loss of her husband in a senseless battle fought weeks after the war had ended and a mysterious stranger who has returned to tell of her husband&amp;rsquo;s needless death. Hanna finds their journeys of redemption and recovery both depend on those they still hold close, but betrayal and deliverance come in many unexpected forms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Lindley&amp;rsquo;s new fourth novel continues his series of stories of love, challenged relationships and life struggles with parallel storylines set in both present-day and compelling historical contexts. His first novel, THE SEASONS OF THE EMMALEE was twice an Amazon Kindle #1 for Historical Fiction, Mystery and Suspense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise and Five Stars for Michael Lindley novels&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; Lindley is a masterful storyteller, effortlessly moving between past and present.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; his work reads elegantly and is artfully crafted.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; beautifully merges storylines of then and now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;&amp;hellip; a rising talent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
