  <title>The Day the Sun Died - Yan Lianke, Carlos Rojas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Day the Sun Died&lt;/i&gt; was awarded the Dream of the Red Chamber Award, which is regarded as one of the most prestigious awards for Chinese-language novels&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yan was twice short-listed for the Man Booker International Prize (most recently for &lt;i&gt;The Four Books&lt;/i&gt;), as well as the Prix Femina Étranger, the &lt;i&gt;Financial Times&lt;/i&gt; Oppenheimer Emerging Voices Award, the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize, and the Man Asian Literary Award&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He recently won the Franz Kafka Prize for his body of work (the first Chinese writer to receive the award) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is Yan Lianke at the height of his talent for surrealism, depicting a town of sleepwalking villagers acting out their darkest desires&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Day the Sun Died&lt;/i&gt; Yan explores, with great suspense and humor, the nationalistic ideal of the “Chinese dream”—a socialist initiative that promotes the role of the individual in returning the country to greatness&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Years, Months, Days&lt;/i&gt; was selected as a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; Editors’ Choice, and a best book of the year by Colm Tóibín in &lt;i&gt;Bookforum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Yan’s reputation continues to grow as one of the most renowned novelists writing from inside China today; in a &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; “By the Book” column, Amos Oz called Yan “a great Chinese writer,” and in the &lt;i&gt;NYTBR&lt;/i&gt; for &lt;i&gt;The Explosion Chronicles&lt;/i&gt;, Jiayang Fan wrote: “I can think of few better novelists than Yan, with his superlative gifts for storytelling and penetrating eye for truth”" />
