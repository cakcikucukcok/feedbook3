  <title>The Bradshaw Variations - Rachel Cusk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since quitting work to look after his eight-year-old daughter, Alexa, Thomas Bradshaw has found solace and grace in his daily piano study. His pursuit of a more artistic way of life shocks and irritates his parents and in-laws. Why has he swapped roles with Tonie Swann, his intense, intellectual wife, who has accepted a demanding full-time job? How can this be good for Alexa?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonie is increasingly seduced away from domestic life by the harder, headier world of work, where long-forgotten memories of ambition are awakened. She soon finds herself outside their tight family circle, alive to previously unimaginable possibilities. Over the course of a year full of crisis and revelation, we follow the fortunes of Tonie, Thomas, and his brothers and their families: Howard, the successful, indulgent brother, and his gregarious wife, Claudia; and Leo, lacking in confidence and propped up by Susie, his sharp-tongued, heavy-drinking wife. At the head of the family, the aging Bradshaw parents descend on their children to question and undermine them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bradshaw Variations &lt;/i&gt;reveals how our choices, our loves, and the family life we build will always be an echo--a variation--of a theme played out in our own childhood. This masterful and often shockingly funny novel, Rachel Cusk&#39;s seventh, shows a prizewinning writer at the height of her powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
