  <title>Mirror, Shoulder, Signal - Dorthe Nors, Misha Hoekstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A smart, witty novel of driving lessons and vertigo, short-listed for the Man Booker International Prize&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonja is ready to get on with her life. She&#39;s over forty now, and the Swedish crime novels she translates are losing their fascination. She sees a masseuse, tries to reconnect with her sister, and is finally learning to drive. But under the overbearing gaze of her driving instructor, Sonja is unable to shift gears for herself. And her vertigo, which she has always carefully hidden, has begun to manifest at the worst possible moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sonja hoped her move to Copenhagen years ago would have left rural Jutland in the rearview mirror. Yet she keeps remembering the dramatic landscapes of her childhood--the endless sky, the whooper swans, the rye fields--and longs to go back. But how can she return to a place that she no longer recognizes? And how can she escape the alienating streets of Copenhagen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Mirror, Shoulder, Signal&lt;/i&gt;, Dorthe Nors brings her distinctive blend of style, humor, and insight to a poignant journey of one woman in search of herself when there&#39;s no one to ask for directions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
