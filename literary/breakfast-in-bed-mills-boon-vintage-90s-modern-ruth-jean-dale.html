          &lt;strong&gt;He bet breakfast in bed that he was irresistible! &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As soon as Brooke met Garrett she knew he was a charmer. Women probably just rolled over when he petted them, much the same way her cats, traitors all, had responded to him. The best thing for Brooke was to keep out of his way, but she just couldn&#39;t now that Garrett&#39;s five-year-old daughter, Molly, was without a mother or a nanny and so much in need of her love and affection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Well, so be it, and if Garrett Jackson did start his seduction routine on her he would soon discover that she wasn&#39;t about to offer him breakfast in her bed!&lt;/p&gt;
