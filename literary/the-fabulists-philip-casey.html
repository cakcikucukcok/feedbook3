  <title>The Fabulists - Philip Casey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes all that can heal grief is the right story.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In late 1980s Dublin, Tess meets Mungo, who, like herself, is ridden with guilt &amp;ndash; she because she is forced to leave her son with her hated husband; he because his son is scarred after a fire caused by his carelessness. They are too hurt to reveal their real selves to each other, but Tess hits on inventing a fantastic life in Berlin, and he picks up on it, inventing an equally fantastic life in Spain. Their fables spark erotic desire, and afford them the courage to confront their anguish and deepest fears. It isn&amp;rsquo;t important that they stay together &amp;ndash; and Tess does strike out with new lovers, to Mungo&amp;rsquo;s initial bewilderment; what is important is that they finish their stories.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
