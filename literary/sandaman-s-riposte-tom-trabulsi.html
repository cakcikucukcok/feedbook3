  <title>Sandaman’S Riposte - Tom Trabulsi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;riposte \ri-&#39;post\:&lt;br&gt; 
1. a fencers quick return thrust following a parry.&lt;br&gt; 
2. a retaliatory maneuver or measure. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Zeke Sandaman is a twenty-something Boston bicycle messenger living as far off the radar as he can. With no bank account, no phone, no insurance, and no plans for change, Zeke is quietly paying the price for a short lifetime of bad choices. But everything grows even more uncertain in Zekes already precarious world when he receives a threat from the remnants of his teenage days spent with the Burgess Street Mob. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;His incarcerated brother Josh is about to be released from prison, and members of the gang his brother had ruthlessly commanded as a young man want nothing more than revenge. After Josh reappears into society, Zeke learns the awful truth: the head of a prison gang has placed an impossible debt on Joshs shouldersone Zeke has now inherited. As everyone turns against him and the clock on his life begins running out, Zeke becomes nothing short of desperate. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this gritty, suspenseful tale, two brothers are caught in a frantic struggle between the past and the future and must come up with a way out before it is too late.&lt;/p&gt;" />
