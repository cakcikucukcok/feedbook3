      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The second Mrs. Bellini Claire would make some man the perfect wife - everyone said so.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But after being jilted by her fiance, she wasn&#39;t sure she believed in love anymore. Until she saw her best friend reunited with the husband she thought she&#39;d lost forever - and Claire&#39;s faith in romance was restored. Staying with the happy couple, it seemed like fate when she met their closest friend, Romano Bellini. He was beautiful, and for a fleeting moment Claire wondered if… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Romano had been married before and didn&#39;t want his life complicated by a second wife. Curious, then, that the subject of marriage just kept coming up!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HUSBANDS &amp; WIVES &lt;em&gt;Sometimes the perfect marriage is worth waiting for!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
