What he thought was going to be an easy transition back into the life of a hustler quickly revealed otherwise. In the midst of coming up in the game and dealing with his own issues is his sister, Deidre, who is all grown up and heavily involved with a notorious and abusive King Pin. DeAndre s attempt to deliver her from the hands of this vicious maniac, the murder of a childhood friend and the deceit of an ex-lover scorned, turns his world upside down, sending him on a path of vengeance from Chicago across international waters. In an urban plot of sex, money, loyalty and betrayal, come witness street life where we are affected by the choices we make and the Chances we take." />
