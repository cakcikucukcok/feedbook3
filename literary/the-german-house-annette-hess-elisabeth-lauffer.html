  <title>The German House - Annette Hess, Elisabeth Lauffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As seen in the&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A December 2019 Indie Next Pick!&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set against the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials of 1963, Annette Hess&amp;#8217;s international bestseller is a harrowing yet ultimately uplifting coming-of-age story about a young female translator&amp;#8212;caught between societal and familial expectations and her unique ability to speak truth to power&amp;#8212;as she fights to expose the dark truths of her nation&amp;#8217;s past.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If everything your family told you was a lie, how far would you go to uncover the truth? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For twenty-four-year-old Eva Bruhns, World War II is a foggy childhood memory. At the war&amp;#8217;s end, Frankfurt was a smoldering ruin, severely damaged by the Allied bombings. But that was two decades ago. Now it is 1963, and the city&amp;#8217;s streets, once cratered are smooth and paved. Shiny new stores replace scorched rubble. Eager for her wealthy suitor, J&amp;#252;rgen Schoormann, to propose, Eva dreams of starting a new life away from her parents and sister. But Eva&amp;#8217;s plans are turned upside down when a&amp;#160;fiery&amp;#160;investigator, David Miller, hires her as a translator for a war crimes trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she becomes more deeply involved in the Frankfurt Trials, Eva begins to question her family&amp;#8217;s silence on the war and her future. Why do her parents refuse to talk about what happened? What are they hiding? Does she really love J&amp;#252;rgen and will she be happy as a housewife? Though it means going against the wishes of her family and her lover, Eva, propelled by her own conscience , joins a team of fiery prosecutors determined to bring the Nazis to justice&amp;#8212;a decision that will help change the present and the past of her nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
