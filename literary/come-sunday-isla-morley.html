  <title>Come Sunday - Isla Morley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A wonderful new storyteller unleashes a soaring debut that sweeps from the hills of Hawaii to the veldt of South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Come Sunday &lt;/i&gt;is that joyous, special thing: a saga that captivates from the very first page, breaking our hearts while making our spirits soar. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbe Deighton is a woman who has lost her bearings. Once a child of the African plains, she is now settled in Hawaii, married to a minister, and waging her battles in a hallway of monotony. There is the leaky roof, the chafing expectations of her husband&#39;s congregation, and the constant demands of motherhood. But in an instant, beginning with the skid of tires, Abbe&#39;s battlefield is transformed when her three-year-old daughter is killed, triggering in Abbe a seismic grief that will cut a swath through the landscape of her life and her identity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What an enthralling debut this is! What a storyteller we have here! As Isla Morley&#39;s novel sweeps from the hills of Honolulu to the veldt of South Africa, we catch a hint of the spirit of Barbara Kingsolver and the mesmerizing truth of Jodi Picoult. We are reminded of how it felt, a while ago, to dive into the drama of &lt;i&gt;The Thorn Birds&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Come Sunday &lt;/i&gt;is a novel about searching for a true homeland, family bonds torn asunder, and the unearthing of decades-old secrets. It is a novel to celebrate, and Isla Morley is a writer to love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
