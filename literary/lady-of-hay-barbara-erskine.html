  <title>Lady of Hay - Barbara Erskine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Two Women, Eight Hundred Years, and the Destiny They Share&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;Barbara Erskine can make us feel the cold, smell the filth, and experience some of the fear of the power of evil men...The author&#39;s storytelling talent is undeniable.&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Times of London&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With a story as mesmerizing as it is chilling, &lt;i&gt;Lady of Hay &lt;/i&gt;explores how Jo, a journalist investigating hypnotic regression, plunges into the life of Matilda, Lady of Hay-who lived eight hundred years earlier. As she learns of Matilda&#39;s unhappy marriage, her troubled love for Richard de Clare, and the brutal treatment she received from King John, it seems that Jo&#39;s past and present are hopelessly entwined. Centuries later, a story of secret passion and unspeakable treachery is about to begin again-and she has no choice but to brave both lives if she wants to shake the iron grip of history.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;So well researched and so well written that it is almost impossible to put down. The novel has everything that readers of racy fiction could ask for: beautiful characters, exotic settings, and passion...situations and characters that are so completely convincing that they come to life.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Philadelphia Inquirer&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Told with hair-raising intensity, this is a gripping tale.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Daily News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Barbara Erskine is a superb storyteller.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;i&gt;-Los Angeles Daily News&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Fascinating, absorbing, original-all such praise comes easily when describing Barbara Erskine&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Lady of Hay&lt;/i&gt;.
