          &lt;strong&gt;SECRET BABY HEIR TO THE THRONE!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How could a small-town librarian with her nose in books - not the tabloids - know that the man she&#39;d fallen for years ago was literally a prince? Or that their love child was heir to a royal throne? All Allison knew was that his seductive charm had turned her from a girl into a woman… .&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;TEMPORARY PRINCESS&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Unable to forget her, Jacob returned for one last taste of Allison&#39;s sweet lips. When he discovered his son, he proposed a temporary marriage of convenience to save his family from scandal. By law, Jacob was not allowed to marry a &quot;commoner.&quot; But he was determined to bend the rules and make Allison a permanent princess by Christmas… .&lt;/p&gt;
