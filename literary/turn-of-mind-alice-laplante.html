  <title>Turn of Mind - Alice Laplante</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;A stunning first novel, both literary and thriller, about a retired orthopedic surgeon with dementia, &lt;i&gt;Turn of Mind&lt;/i&gt; has already received worldwide attention. With unmatched patience and a pulsating intensity, Alice LaPlante brings us deep into a brilliant woman&amp;#8217;s deteriorating mind, where the impossibility of recognizing reality can be both a blessing and a curse.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the book opens, Dr. Jennifer White&amp;#8217;s best friend, Amanda, who lived down the block, has been killed, and four fingers surgically removed from her hand. Dr. White is the prime suspect and she herself doesn&amp;#8217;t know whether she did it. Told in White&amp;#8217;s own voice, fractured and eloquent, a picture emerges of the surprisingly intimate, complex alliance between these life-long friends&amp;#151;two proud, forceful women who were at times each other&amp;#8217;s most formidable adversaries. As the investigation into the murder deepens and White&amp;#8217;s relationships with her live-in caretaker and two grown children intensify, a chilling question lingers: is White&amp;#8217;s shattered memory preventing her from revealing the truth or helping her to hide it?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A startling portrait of a disintegrating mind clinging to bits of reality through anger, frustration, shame, and unspeakable loss, &lt;i&gt;Turn of Mind&lt;/i&gt; is a remarkable debut that examines the deception and frailty of memory and how it defines our very existence.&lt;/div&gt;" />
