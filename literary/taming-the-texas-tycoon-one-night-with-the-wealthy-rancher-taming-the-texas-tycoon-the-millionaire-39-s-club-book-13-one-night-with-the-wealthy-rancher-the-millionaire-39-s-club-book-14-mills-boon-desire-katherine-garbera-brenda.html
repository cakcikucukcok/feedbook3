        &lt;p&gt;For years Kate Thornton had dreamed of becoming Mrs Lance Brody. Then her boss became engaged strictly for business and Kate had had enough. Giving her two weeks’ notice should have released her, but Lance wasn’t about to let her leave. Not even if it meant taking her to bed to keep her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; One Night with the Wealthy Rancher &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Brenda Jackson&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Darius Foster was still trying to forget the incredible night he’d spent with Summer Martindale…a night that never should have happened. Certain she had relocated just to get close to him – and his millions – the ex-lawman vowed to keep his distance…until danger came calling; then Darius knew he was the only one who could protect her.&lt;/p&gt;
