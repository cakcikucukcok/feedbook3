  <title>Encircling - Carl Frode Tiller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The brilliant first novel in the Encircling Trilogy, a searing psychological portrait of a man by his friends&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David has lost his memory. When a newspaper ad asks his friends and  family to share their memories of him, three respond: Jon, his closest  friend; Silje, his teenage girlfriend; and Arvid, his estranged  stepfather. Their letters reveal David&#39;s early life in the small town of  Namsos, full of teenage rebellion, the uncertainties of first love, and  intense experiments in art and music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the narrative circles  ever closer to David, the letters interweave with scenes from the  present day, and it becomes less and less clear what to believe. Jon&#39;s  and Silje&#39;s adult lives have run aground on thwarted ambition and failed  intimacy, and Arvid has had a lonely struggle with cancer. Each has  suspect motives for writing, and soon a contradictory picture of David  emerges. Whose remembrance of him is right? Or do they all hold some  fragment of the truth?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carl Frode Tiller&#39;s masterful opening novel to the Encircling Trilogy won the European Prize for Literature, the English PEN Award, and the Hunger Prize. &lt;i&gt;Encircling&lt;/i&gt;, with  David as its brooding central enigma, confronts the relativity of  memory in an audacious and daring novel that reveals the shape of a life  and leaves us wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
