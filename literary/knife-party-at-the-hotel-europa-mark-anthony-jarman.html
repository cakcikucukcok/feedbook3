  <title>Knife Party at the Hotel Europa - Mark Anthony Jarman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shortlisted, Alistair MacLeod Award for Short Fiction, New Brunswick Book Award for Fiction, and Thomas Raddall Atlantic Fiction Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of Canada&#39;s literary treasures, Mark Anthony Jarman returns with a&amp;nbsp;book of moving and often funny tales of a man&#39;s quest for himself. A.S. Byatt says that his writing is &amp;#34;extraordinary, his stories gripping,&amp;#34; and in this gorgeous new collection, Jarman delivers something new once again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Knife Party at the Hotel Europa&lt;/i&gt;, Jarman writes about losing and finding love, marriage and melancholy, the dislocation and redemptive power of travel in Italy&#39;s sensual summer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A man travels to Italy to escape the memory of love lost, and a marriage ended. He passes through sun-drenched landscapes of cliffs and seaside paradises, while the corpses&amp;nbsp; of refugees wash up on the beach; he parties with the young and beautiful Italians he meets on the train while a man bleeds to death in the hallway. A teenage thief prowls the roof of the tourist hotel at night; an embassy is bombed; holy statues come alive to roam in a gang stealing used restaurant grease.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He suffers the acute loneliness of one who has abandoned and been abandoned, and in this exquisite suffering, he finds how beautiful this life can be. In vivid, sensuous prose, Jarman&amp;#39;s stories circle and overlap in surprising, weird, and wonderful ways. Tangents turn out to be crucial, allusions are powerful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
