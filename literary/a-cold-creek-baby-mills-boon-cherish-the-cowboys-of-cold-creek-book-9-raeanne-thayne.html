  <title>A Cold Creek Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (The Cowboys of Cold Creek, Book 9) - RaeAnne Thayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Dare to dream… these sparkling romances will make you laugh, cry and fall in love – again and again!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She’d dreamed about him coming back with a baby in his arms… And now Cisco was home.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the baby he carried couldn’t possibly be theirs. Still, Easton got part of her wish. The man she could never stop loving was back, even for just a little while – with a serious injury, a beautiful baby girl and an explanation about them both that was as flimsy as his excuse for leaving years before.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And after five long years of trying to forget him, Easton was faced with a choice: love him – and that little girl – while she had them, or get out now. Because she’d never escape with her heart intact a second time…&lt;/p&gt;
