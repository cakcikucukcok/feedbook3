  <title>A Snowstorm in Cuba - Vlad Bunea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anna and Luke are middle-class Occupy activists from Toronto on a much-deserved vacation for romance and relaxation in Cuba. There is tension in their relationship, and they hope to ease the tumult by spending time alone, away from the pressures of life. On their way to Cuba, though, they make the acquaintance of another couple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine and Charles are extravagantly wealthy and represent what Anna and Luke detest about capitalist culture. Still, the two couples form an unexpected bond and end up spending the entire week together. Despite what on the surface seems to be a growing friendship, each player in this strange foreign game has other things in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anna, an artist, hopes to sell several of her paintings to the affluent Catherine. Luke is also interested in Catherine but for different, lustful reasons, whereas Charles seems depressed by just about everything. When an unexpected storm descends on Cuba, Anna finds herself alone with a drunken Charles; Luke is alone with Catherine. Then, someone ends up missing, and both couples are left wondering if their random meeting was random at all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
