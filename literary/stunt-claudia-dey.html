  <title>Stunt - Claudia Dey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eugenia Ledoux wakes one morning to a note on the kitchen table: &amp;#147;Gone to save the world. Sorry. Yours, Sheb Woolly Ledoux. Asshole.&amp;#8221; Eugenia is nine years old, a synaesthesiac and a tightrope walker. She adores her father and his lunatic charms; she loves that he takes her fishing in the middle of the night and calls her Stunt. Sheb has always promised he&amp;#8217;ll one day take her to the moonscape of northern Ontario, where astronauts train; instead he writes a note, blows up a shoulder-pad factory, and leaves. His heartbroken daughter is left behind with her mother, the sharp-edged former ingenue Mink, and her sister, the death-obsessed and hauntingly beautiful Immaculata.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After a fake funeral for Sheb, Mink vanishes too. Eugenia and Immaculata, left alone, double in age overnight. Immaculata becomes a swan-like giantess, and soon finds her calling caring for Leopold, a diseased and irresistible malcontent down the street. Eugenia, however, stays the same: dark and diminutive, and bereft. She finds herself a bicycle and sets off to track down her father, encountering an astronaut and a waitress named Cupid along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Stunt&lt;/I&gt; is the first novel by one of Canada&amp;#8217;s most acclaimed playwrights. Like synaesthetic Eugenia, your senses will be addled as Dey&amp;#8217;s words take on colours, tastes, and smells, somehow coming to mean more than you thought they did; they depict, with compassionate hilarity and luminous heartbreak, the love between a girl and her father.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
