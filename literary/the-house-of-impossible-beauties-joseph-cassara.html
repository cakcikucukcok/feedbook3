Burned by her traumatic past, Angel is new to the drag world, new to ball culture, and has a yearning inside of her to help create family for those without. When she falls in love with Hector, a beautiful young man who dreams of becoming a professional dancer, the two decide to form the House of Xtravaganza, the first-ever all-Latino house in the Harlem ball circuit. But when Hector dies of AIDS-related complications, Angel must bear the responsibility of tending to their house alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mother of the house, Angel recruits Venus, a whip-fast trans girl who dreams of finding a rich man to take care of her; Juanito, a quiet boy who loves fabrics and design; and Daniel, a butch queen who accidentally saves Venus&amp;#8217;s life. The Xtravaganzas must learn to navigate sex work, addiction, and persistent abuse, leaning on each other as bulwarks against a world that resists them. All are ambitious, resilient, and determined to control their own fates, even as they hurtle toward devastating consequences.&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Told in a voice that brims with wit, rage, tenderness, and fierce yearning,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The House of Impossible Beauties&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a tragic story of love, family, and the dynamism of the human spirit.&amp;#160;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
