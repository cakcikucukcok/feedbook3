  <title>The Man Who Loved Dogs - Leonardo Padura, Anna Kushner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A gripping novel about the assassination of Leon Trotsky in Mexico City in 1940&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Loved Dogs&lt;/i&gt;, Leonardo Padura brings a noir sensibility to one of the most fascinating and complex political narratives of the past hundred years: the assassination of Leon Trotsky by Ramón Mercader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story revolves around Iván Cárdenas Maturell, who in his youth was the great hope of modern Cuban literature--until he dared to write a story that was deemed counterrevolutionary. When we meet him years later in Havana, Iván is a loser: a humbled and defeated man with a quiet, unremarkable life who earns his modest living as a proofreader at a veterinary magazine. One afternoon, he meets a mysterious foreigner in the company of two Russian wolfhounds. This is &quot;the man who loved dogs,&quot; and as the pair grow closer, Iván begins to understand that his new friend is hiding a terrible secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving seamlessly between Iván&#39;s life in Cuba, Ramón&#39;s early years in Spain and France, and Trotsky&#39;s long years of exile, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Loved Dogs &lt;/i&gt;is Padura&#39;s most ambitious and brilliantly executed novel yet. This is a story about political ideals tested and characters broken, a multilayered epic that effortlessly weaves together three different plot threads-- Trotsky in exile, Ramón in pursuit, Iván in frustrated stasis--to bring emotional truth to historical fact.&lt;br&gt;A novel whose reach is matched only by its astonishing successes on the page, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Loved&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dogs &lt;/i&gt;lays bare the human cost of abstract ideals and the insidious, corrosive effects of life under a repressive political regime.&lt;/p&gt;" />
