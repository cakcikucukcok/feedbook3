  <title>Appearances - Sondra Helene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• Sadly, millions of Americans are affected by lung cancer every year. The American Cancer Society’s estimates for lung cancer in the United States for 2018 are about 234,030 new cases of lung cancer (121,680 in men and 112,350 in women) and about 154,050 deaths from lung cancer (83,550 in men and 70,500 in women).
• Lung cancer is by far the leading cause of cancer death among both men and women. Each year more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast, prostate and pancreatic cancer combined. Furthermore, more than 430,000 people alive today have been diagnosed with lung cancer at some point.
• According to the American Psychological Association, about 40 to 50 percent of married couples in the United States divorce. The divorce rate for subsequent marriages is even higher. 
• According to the Pew Research Center, many Americans have faced end-of-life medical issues through experiences with friends or relatives. About half of adults (47%) say they have a friend or relative who has had a terminal illness or who has been in a coma within the last five years. This experience cuts across most social and demographic groups, including age, gender, education and religious affiliation. 
• The issue of tension between a person’s spouse and his or her family of origin is a common one. According to psychologist Terri Apter, “In the context of in-laws, many people have a tendency towards bias and resentment that does not emerge in their behavior elsewhere, with a partner, blood family, or friends” (&lt;em&gt;What Do You Want From Me? Learning to Get Along with In-Laws&lt;/em&gt;), and &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports that more than 60 percent of women say a relationship with a female in-law has caused them long-term unhappiness and stress. 
AUDIENCE:
• Anyone who is married/is in a relationship and is close to his or her family of origin
• Anyone who feels trapped in a fraying marriage
• Anyone who has a family member or close friend with a terminal illness
• Anyone who has been affected by lung cancer
• Women with sisters" />
