  <title>Adam Gould - Julia O&#39;Faolain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Paris in the 1890s. Adam Gould, whose Anglo-Irish father has disowned him, works in a lunatic asylum run by the celebrated Dr Blanche, some of whose patients once starred in France&#39;s social firmament and still, when sane, sit at table with distinguished guests. One such patient is Guy de Maupassant. Another is Belcastel, who has taken the blame for a monarchist plot against the Third Republic, then feigned insanity. Madness and uncertain identity drive Adam&#39;s story, fuelled by Maupassant&#39;s sparkling insights on the matter. Gould falls in love with a married connection of Belcastel&#39;s. And things are made no simpler on his return home, when he becomes entangled with a cousin who looks hauntingly like his dead mother. A writer of stunning quality, a novelist of irony and compassion.&#39; The Daily Telegraph Splendidly readable.&#39; William Trevor &#39;...a highly original work of fiction, urbane, elegant and full of esprit.&#39; Patricia Craig Independent &#39;...a remarkable work, written in a style of steely distinction.&#39; Francis King Literary Review &#39;... a vivid and absorbing story, fast-paced and confident of its strong historical flavourings.&#39; Eve Patten Irish Times &#39;The novel is witty and thoutghtful...&#39; Times Literary Supplement" />
