  <title>Passionately Ever After (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) (Dynasties: The Barones, Book 12) - Metsy Hingle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;HE&#39;D TRACKED HER DOWN…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;…in the snow-covered Montana mountains. But in his runaway lover&#39;s glistening eyes Steven Conti could see she still loved him, still wanted him. And from her rounded belly he could see she hid his unborn baby. Nothing would stop Steven from taking them home to Boston–his woman &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; his child.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From their first night together, Maria Barone was branded by his kiss; she could belong to no one but Steven. But he was a Conti, and she a Barone–sworn enemies and feuding rivals. Maria wanted Steven, as a husband, a lover, a father to her baby. But could they find happily-ever-after–or had she fallen for the one man she could never keep?&lt;/p&gt;
