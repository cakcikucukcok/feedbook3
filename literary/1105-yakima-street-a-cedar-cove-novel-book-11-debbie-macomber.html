  <title>1105 Yakima Street (A Cedar Cove Novel, Book 11) - Debbie Macomber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Perfect for fans of Maeve Binchy&#39; - &lt;em&gt;Candis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Dear Reader, You&#39;ve probably heard that my wife has left me. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rachel&#39;s pregnant and she says she can&#39;t handle the stress in our household anymore. My thirteen-year-old daughter, Jolene, is jealous of her. Maybe it&#39;s my fault. As a widower I spoiled her— Jolene was reading over my shoulder just now and says that&#39;s not true. She claims Rachel ruined everything. But that&#39;s not true.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The real question is: How can I get my wife back? I don&#39;t even know where she is. She&#39;s not with Teri Polgar or any of her other friends from the salon. The other question is…when will Jolene grow up and stop acting like such a brat? I&#39;m not the only one in town with problems. Linc Wyse&#39;s father-in-law is trying to destroy his business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And you know Charlotte Rhodes? Seems she&#39;s becoming forgetful and the family&#39;s worried about her and Ben. Lots of other stuff going on—but Rachel is better at keeping up with it than I am. If you have any idea where my wife is, give me a call. Please.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Cedar Cove series is now a hit Channel 5 TV series, appearing on UK screens on CHANNEL 5USA &lt;/strong&gt;
