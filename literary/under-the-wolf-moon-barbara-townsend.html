  <title>Under the Wolf Moon - Barbara Townsend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Turbulent times pit North against South, new immigrant against old in the 1850s Potomac Highlands. Under the Wolf Moon has passion, life, death, and redemption.&lt;p&gt;
The haunting sound of a mountain dulcimer channels its way through the hollow, softly echoing off the rocks and trees. Because of that, lives are drawn together like the confluence of two great rivers.&lt;p&gt;
An embittered drayman, seduced by bigotry, acts out his revenge. Zebediah, an injured child, is a wounded healer who becomes the pivot between rage and redemption. Woven into the tapestry are an ancient Indian and a black midwife who guide people as shamanic wisdom holders.&lt;p&gt;
Under the Wolf Moon is the story of a man and a woman whose lives are held in tension between cultural and personal prejudice and the nobility of the human spirit. Under the wolf moon, the January moon, life and death come full circle. &lt;p&gt;
An historical fiction worthy of its place in the genre. &lt;br&gt;
Norma Blacke Bourdeau, writer, poet, professor of Creative Writing, Frostburg University&lt;p&gt;
Quick and precise character development and a fast moving story linea real page turner.  &lt;br&gt;
