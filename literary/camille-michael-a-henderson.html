  <title>Camille - Michael A Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Camille&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a young woman struggling to rediscover herself in the aftermath of scandal in her small Mississippi hometown. Coming out of high school, Camille purposes to live within the privacy of a secluded life of work, content to rely only upon her mother for comfort and books for companionship. Though immensely intelligent, Camille chooses to hide beneath a hoodie rather than explore life. She finds escape only within an imagination which hops about with childlike ease. Yet all hopscotch pattern&amp;rsquo;s chalked upon the sidewalks of Camille&amp;rsquo;s mind invariably lead back to the same place &amp;ndash; that most painful moment in the past. Her mind and heart, like gladiators in a ring, clash for control of the future such that her only real plan in life is to remain at home with Mama. That plan changes when Mama sends Camille off to college. There, Camille reverts to her childhood tendencies as an outcast, unable to connect with her peers. On her own for the first time, she must decide between security beneath a hoodie and the vulnerability necessary for friendship and love. Her plans for coping become the battleground of thought and emotion, and ultimately her chance to choose who she is to be at the core of her person.&lt;/p&gt;" />
