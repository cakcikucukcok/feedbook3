          &lt;strong&gt;Connor Reilly had laughed at his brother for being the first triplet to lose the &quot;no sex for ninety days&quot; bet. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though there were two long, tempting months ahead for him, Connor was determined to go the distance. Because not only was he a marine; he was a Reilly. For two years, Connor had been coming to Emma Jacobsen&#39;s shop, and she&#39;d listened to him talk about this woman and that one.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;d thought their friendship was special. Until he admitted how &quot;safe&quot; and &quot;comfortable&quot; he felt around her. Well, war declared! She was going to show her &quot;pal&quot; just how much of a threat she could be to his winning the bet!&lt;/p&gt;
