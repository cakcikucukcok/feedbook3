          &lt;strong&gt;And Babies Make Five&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Samantha wanted a family – and now she was pregnant with triplets! She wasn’t looking for a father for her babies. It had to be her hormones affecting her feelings for Hector Garza – the handsome man next door. Because surely he wouldn’t be interested in a mother-to-be…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;At Long Last, a Bride &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For years, Joe and Dixie had adored one another – and pushed each other away. Well, no more! Joe knew it was past time for his now ex-fiancée to stand on her own two feet. So why were all roads leading back to each other’s arms?&lt;/p&gt;
