  <title>The Coyote&#39;s Cry (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (The Coltons, Book 5) - Jackie Merritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Jenna, you and I can never be anything but acquaintances.&quot; &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nurse Jenna Elliot knew proud, hardheaded Bram Colton thought she was the town&#39;s spoiled golden girl, and that her father would rather die than let her get involved with a Comanche. But that didn&#39;t stop her from loving the dark, brooding sheriff. Now she was living under Bram&#39;s roof, caring for his ailing grandmother, and he could no longer ignore her or the intense passion stirring between them….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Falling for Jenna Elliot was Bram&#39;s worst nightmare - and ultimate fantasy. He had always wanted the blond, blue-eyed beauty in his home - in his bed, to be exact. But he knew theirs was a forbidden love and he&#39;d fight his warrior-like urges to make Black Arrow&#39;s golden girl his forever….&lt;/p&gt;
