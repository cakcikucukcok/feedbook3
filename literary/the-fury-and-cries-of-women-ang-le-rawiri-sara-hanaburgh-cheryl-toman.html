  <title>The Fury and Cries of Women - Angèle Rawiri, Sara Hanaburgh, Cheryl Toman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gabon&#39;s first female novelist, Angèle Rawiri probed deeper     into the issues that writers a generation before her-Mariama Bâ and Aminata Sow Fall-had     begun to address. Translated by Sara Hanaburgh, this third novel of the three Rawiri published     is considered the richest of her fictional prose. It offers a gripping account of a modern     woman, Emilienne, who questions traditional values and seeks emancipation from     them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emilienne&#39;s active search for feminism on her own terms is tangled     up with cultural expectations and taboos of motherhood, marriage, polygamy, divorce, and     passion. She completes her university studies in Paris; marries a man from another ethnic group;     becomes a leader in women&#39;s liberation; enjoys professional success, even earning more     than her husband; and eventually takes a female lover. Yet still she remains unsatisfied. Those     closest to her, and even she herself, constantly question her role as woman, wife, mother, and     lover. The tragic death of her only child-her daughter Rékia-accentuates Emilienne&#39;s     anguish, all the more so because of her subsequent barrenness and the pressure that she concede     to her husband&#39;s taking a second wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her forceful portrayal of one     woman&#39;s life in Central Africa in the late 1980s, Rawiri prompts us not only to reconsider     our notions of African feminism and the canon of francophone African women&#39;s writing but     also to expand our awareness of the issues women face across the world today in the workforce,     in the bedroom, and among family and peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
