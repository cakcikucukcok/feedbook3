  <title>Grace - Paul Lynch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A Paris Review Staff Pick: a sweeping, Dickensian story of a young girl on a life-changing journey across nineteenth-century Ireland on the eve of the Great Famine.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Early one October morning, Grace&#39;s mother snatches her from sleep and brutally cuts off her hair, declaring, &quot;You are the strong one now.&quot; With winter close at hand and Ireland already suffering, Grace is no longer safe at home. And so her mother outfits her in men&#39;s clothing and casts her out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; When her younger brother Colly follows after her, the two set off on a remarkable odyssey in the looming shadow of their country&#39;s darkest hour.  The broken land they pass through reveals untold suffering as well as unexpected beauty. To survive, Grace must become a boy, a bandit, a penitent and, finally, a woman -- all the while afflicted by inner voices that arise out of what she has seen and what she has lost. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Told in bold and lyrical language by an author who has already been called &quot;one of his generation&#39;s very finest novelists&quot; (Ron Rash, author of &lt;i&gt;The Risen&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Grace&lt;/i&gt; is an epic coming-of-age novel and a poetic evocation of the Irish famine as it has never been written." />
