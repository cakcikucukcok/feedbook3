  <title>Three Daughters - Letty Cottin Pogrebin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An ebullient novel about family secrets and the triumph of sisterly love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driven by a legacy of lies, the shame of their own imperfections, and impending chaos in each of their well-ordered married lives, the three Wasserman daughters struggle with themselves and one another to break their parents&#39; silence and understand their past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shoshanna, control freak and world-class problem solver, stands on the brink of a Big Birthday in the shadow of the Evil Eye, trying to enjoy her happiness and to overcome her fears while also engineering a double reconciliation between her estranged sisters, and between Leah and their rabbi father. Leah, a brilliant English professor and unreconstructed leader of the left, eloquent and foul-mouthed, a crusading feminist and a passionately conflicted wife and mother, grapples with the meaning of abandonment and the unfamiliar demands of her own roiling needs. Rachel, who has papered over her losses with an athlete&#39;s discipline, a fact fetishist&#39;s sense of order, and a pragmatism bordering on self-sacrifice, watches her carefully constructed world fall apart and in the rubble discovers the woman she was meant to be. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Three Daughters&lt;/i&gt; is a rich and complex story of three lives, their loves, and the web of relationships that either hold these lives together or hopelessly entangle them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
