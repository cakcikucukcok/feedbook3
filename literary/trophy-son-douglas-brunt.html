      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Trophy Son &lt;/i&gt;brings Conroy&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Great Santini &lt;/i&gt;and Malamud&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Natural&lt;/i&gt; into the present day...A terrific book.&quot; -Harlan Coben&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private lessons. Professional coaches. Specialized camps for sports, math, music, and other fields.  Today&#39;s children are pushed to achieve excellence--or else. But at what cost? &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Douglas Brunt&#39;s third novel, &lt;i&gt;Trophy Son, &lt;/i&gt;tells the story of a tennis prodigy, from young childhood to the finals of the US Open, Wimbledon, and other tournaments around the world.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up in the wealthy suburbs of Philadelphia, Anton Stratis is groomed to be one thing only: the #1 tennis player in the world. Trained relentlessly by his obsessive father, a former athlete who plans every minute of his son&#39;s life, Anton both aspires to greatness and resents its all-consuming demands. Lonely and isolated--removed from school and socialization to focus on tennis--Anton explodes from nowhere onto the professional scene and soon becomes one of the top-ranked players in the world, with a coach, a trainer, and an entourage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Anton struggles to find a balance between stardom and family, he begins to make compromises--first with himself, then with his health, and finally with the rules of tennis, a mix that will threaten to destroy everything he has worked for.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trophy Son &lt;/i&gt;offers an inside look at the dangers of extraordinary pressure to achieve, whether in sports or any field, through the eyes of a young man defying his parents&#39; ambitions as he seeks a life of his own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
