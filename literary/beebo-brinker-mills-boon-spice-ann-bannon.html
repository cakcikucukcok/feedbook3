  <title>Beebo Brinker (Mills &amp; Boon Spice) - Ann Bannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The classic 1950s love story from the Queen of Lesbian Pulp Fiction, and author of Odd Girl Out, I Am a Woman, Women in the Shadows, Journey to a Woman and Beebo Brinker&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;She never knew what she wanted – until she came to Greenwich Village and found the love that smolders in the shadows of the twilight world.&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking a pseudonym in the interest of privacy, Bannon wrote her first book, Odd Girl Out, as a coming-of-age novel that involved love between college sorority sisters. When an editor singled-out the school-girl romance as her story&#39;s most compelling feature, the book was re-written for a lesbian pulp fiction audience. Unlike most pulps, however, Bannon broke with tradition by avoiding sensationalistic plots in favour of emotionally engaged character development.&lt;br /&gt;Odd Girl Out enjoyed tremendous success, inspiring other ground-breaking works, most notably Beebo Brinker. Her sensitive renderings of sexuality also won Bannon a devoted following among isolated lesbians everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&quot;I got nice letters from a lot of really lovely women, and women who were hurting a lot, and women all over the country,&quot; Bannon remarks. &quot;So many saying, &#39;Thank God I finally got connected with somebody who really knows what this is about.&#39; &quot; The character of Beebo is among the most-loved lesbians ever to appear in gay and lesbian fiction. &quot;I never met Beebo in the flesh, but she was part of my daydreams from a very early time,&quot; Bannon says of her ultra-butch protagonist.&lt;/p&gt;
