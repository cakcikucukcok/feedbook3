  <title>You Too Can Have a Body Like Mine - Alexandra Kleeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An intelligent and madly entertaining debut novel reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;The Crying of Lot 49,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;White Noise&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;City of Glass&lt;/em&gt; that is at once a missing-person mystery, an exorcism of modern culture, and a wholly singular vision of contemporary womanhood from a terrifying and often funny voice of a new generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman known only by the letter A lives in an unnamed American city with her roommate, B, and boyfriend, C, who wants her to join him on a reality show called &lt;em&gt;That&amp;#8217;s My Partner!&lt;/em&gt; A eats (or doesn&amp;#8217;t) the right things, watches endless amounts of television, often just for the commercials&amp;#8212;particularly the recurring cartoon escapades of Kandy Kat, the mascot for an entirely chemical dessert&amp;#8212;and models herself on a standard of beauty that only exists in such advertising. She fixates on the fifteen minutes of fame a news-celebrity named Michael has earned after buying up his local Wally Supermarket&amp;#8217;s entire, and increasingly ample, supply of veal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile B is attempting to make herself a twin of A, who hungers for something to give meaning to her life, something aside from C&amp;#8217;s pornography addiction, and becomes indoctrinated by a new religion spread throughout a web of corporate franchises, which moves her closer to the decoys that populate her television world, but no closer to her true nature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
