  <title>There&#39;s Something About Christmas (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Debbie Macomber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Perfect for fans of Maeve Binchy&#39; - &lt;em&gt;Candis&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Emma Collins has always believed that the world is divided into two kinds of people: those who love fruitcake and those who don&#39;t. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;s firmly in the second category, so it&#39;s ironic that her first major assignment for the Puyallup, Washington, Examiner is a series of articles about. . . fruitcake. At least it&#39;s a step up from writing obituaries. Her task is to interview the finalists in a fruitcake recipe contest, and that means traveling around the state. Actually. . . flying around the state.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Local pilot Oliver Hamilton, who&#39;s starting an airfreight business, has agreed to take her wherever she needs to go, in exchange for free advertising. Unfortunately Emma hates small planes — almost as much as she hates fruitcake. But in the weeks leading up to Christmas, Emma falls for Oliver (who&#39;s not quite the Scrooge he sometimes seems) and his mutt, Oscar (who&#39;s allergic to her perfume, which makes him sneeze repeatedly).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And she meets three wise women who know a lot about fruitcake — and even more about life. It all reminds her that there&#39;s something about Christmas. Something special. . .&lt;/p&gt;
