  <title>Property Values - Charles Demers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt; A new novel by author-comedian Charles Demers, one of Canada’s great young stand-up comedians and the author of four previous books, including the essay collections &lt;i&gt;The Horrors&lt;/i&gt; (Douglas &amp; McIntyre) and &lt;i&gt;The Dad Dialogues &lt;/i&gt; (Arsenal). Charles is also the editor of the Arsenal imprint Robin’s Egg Books, which publishes its second title, &lt;i&gt;The Great NDN Paradox&lt;/i&gt; by Ryan McMahon, in fall 2018.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The novel is both a send-up of, and a paean to, the traditional crime novel, as well as a satire on overpriced housing markets and gang violence prevalent in large urban centers. The premise is simple yet ingenious: a man who is faced with losing his home if he doesn’t buy out his father-in-law concocts a scheme where he fakes a drive-by gang shooting on his property, thereby driving down its value. It would work perfectly if only organized crime members didn’t get wind of his scheme; it goes downhill from there.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Charles has always wanted to write a crime novel; in his own words: “I’m the world’s greatest devotee of &lt;i&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/i&gt; in history; I’ve been obsessed with stories of organized crime since I was a kid. I’ve been reading a lot of Elmore Leonard and Don Winslow lately, and loving the sense of irony and playfulness in those books, though I think my attempt is more straightforwardly comic. The presence of &lt;i&gt;Prizzi’s Honor&lt;/i&gt; , both the film and the book, can be found in my book too.” &lt;/li&gt;" />
