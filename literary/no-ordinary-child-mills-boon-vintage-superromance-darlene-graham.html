  <title>No Ordinary Child (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Superromance) - Darlene Graham</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Meggie is coming to stay!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Normally, architect Sam Solomon would be thrilled that his daughter, Meggie, is coming to live with him. But he&#39;s not happy with the circumstances–his ex-wife has suddenly become ill and is unable to take care of their daughter. On top of that, Sam has just started a huge restoration job that promises to eat up all his time. And Meggie is a handful, requiring a lot more attention than an average ten-year-old because she&#39;s mentally handicapped.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking care of his daughter is a full-time job, so Sam hires a nanny, Christy Lane. Before he knows it, Christy has the unruly Meggie cleaning up her toys, eating her vegetables and playing sports. Christy is so different from any woman he&#39;s ever met–it&#39;s as if she&#39;s from a whole other world. A world he never would&#39;ve known if it wasn&#39;t for the child who brought them together….&lt;/p&gt;
