  <title>The Vanishing Art of Letter Writing - Sally Poor McHenry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a snowy day in Michigan, Taylor Gibbs decides to finish clearing out a storage closet, and comes upon a large cache of old love letters.&lt;br /&gt;
When she begins to read them, she is taken back forty years, to the&lt;br /&gt;
days when she was twenty-one, and dating Bromley Carder. He at Harvard,&lt;br /&gt;
she at Stanford, his letters are a one-sided view of how it was &amp;ndash; to be&lt;br /&gt;
intelligent, highly literate, deeply in love, 3000 miles away, unschooled in&lt;br /&gt;
the art of patience, chained to convention, and young, in 1968.&lt;br /&gt;
Beautifully written, Taylor cannot put the letters down, and reads them&lt;br /&gt;
all in a few days.&lt;br /&gt;
When her own life intercedes and she must put them away, she doesn&amp;rsquo;t&lt;br /&gt;
think of them for a while. then something makes her wonder if Brom should&lt;br /&gt;
be informed of the letters&amp;rsquo; existence. If she can find him.&lt;br /&gt;
She finds him. Then the Fates take over, with their own plans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
