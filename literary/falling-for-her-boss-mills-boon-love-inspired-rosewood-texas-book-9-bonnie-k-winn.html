          &lt;strong&gt;From Nanny to Mom &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tessa Pierce moves to the small town of Rosewood, Texas, hoping to forget all about romance. But her handsome new boss, Morgan Harper, is making that difficult. And his little girl is winning Tessa&#39;s heart more and more every day. The hardworking widower barely has enough time for his child, and certainly none for his beautiful new assistant. But when Tessa steps in to help take care of his daughter, she shows Morgan the close-knit family they could be. If he doesn&#39;t want to lose her, Morgan will need to unravel her mysterious past and prove to Tessa that her future should be with him.&lt;/p&gt;
