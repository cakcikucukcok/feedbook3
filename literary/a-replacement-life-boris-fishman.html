It takes more than law-abiding to become an American; it takes the same self-reinvention in which his people excel. Intoxicated and unmoored by his inventions, Slava risks exposure. Cornered, he commits an irrevocable act that finally grants him a sense of home in America, but not before collecting a price from his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Replacement Life&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;is a dark, moving, and beautifully written novel about family, honor, and justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
