  <title>A Rose in Bloom - Ejine Okoroafor-Ezediaro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A Rose in Bloom&lt;/b&gt; is a contemporary Nigerian cum African Tale. It is more than just an ordinary love story as it also catalogues the cultures and trials of a modern day Nigerian society.
&lt;p&gt;
It narrates the life a young lady on coming of age but in spite of the modernity of times, age old beliefs and tradition nearly derail all her wedding plans.
&lt;P&gt;
Life in the city and the rural areas are unraveled as the struggle between traditional tenets and western influences is traced in the life of Nkiru Ubaka, the heroine of the story. She was born of middle class parents and had the presumed good life.
&lt;p&gt;
On coming of age like a rose in bloom, Nkiru attracted many suitors which initiated a struggle. With that settled and Nkiru now engaged and ready to tie the knot but for another family secret to surface and derail all the well laid out plans.
&lt;p&gt;
The story showcases a dichotomy of ideas: it is as political as it is moral, as modern as it is traditional and as exotic as it is familiar. It ruffles the feathers of Politics, Religion and Tradition in the African context." />
