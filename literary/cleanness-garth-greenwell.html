  <title>Cleanness - Garth Greenwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In the highly anticipated follow-up to his beloved debut, &lt;i&gt;What Belongs to You&lt;/i&gt;, Garth Greenwell deepens his exploration of foreignness, obligation, and desire&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sofia, Bulgaria, a landlocked city in southern Europe, stirs with hope and impending upheaval. Soviet buildings crumble, wind scatters sand from the far south, and political protesters flood the streets with song.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this atmosphere of disquiet, an American teacher navigates a life transformed by the discovery and loss of love. As he prepares to leave the place he&#39;s come to call home, he grapples with the intimate encounters that have marked his years abroad, each bearing uncanny reminders of his past. A queer student&#39;s confession recalls his own first love, a stranger&#39;s seduction devolves into paternal sadism, and a romance with another foreigner opens, and heals, old wounds. Each echo reveals startling insights about what it means to seek connection: with those we love, with the places we inhabit, and with our own fugitive selves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cleanness&lt;/i&gt; revisits and expands the world of Garth Greenwell&#39;s beloved debut, &lt;i&gt;What Belongs to You&lt;/i&gt;, declared &quot;an instant classic&quot; by &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;. In exacting, elegant prose, he transcribes the strange dialects of desire, cementing his stature as one of our most vital living writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
