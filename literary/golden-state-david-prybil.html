  <title>Golden State - David Prybil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On a late-night talk show in the fall of 2003, Arnold Schwarzenegger announces his candidacy for Governor of California. Two months later, he wins, despite having no qualifications for the job beyond playing a hero on screen.&lt;p&gt;
With Arnolds rapid rise to power as a seductive backdrop, Golden State follows a
disparate quartet of characters in the capital
city of Sacramento as they feed off this anything-goes atmosphere and undertake a
variety of misbegotten schemes of their own,
all in pursuit of this same kind of validation
and fulfillment.&lt;p&gt;
There is tightly wound realtor Missy Carver,
determined to find Arnold his Sacramento
dream estate and secure the partnership shes sure will make her feel complete; Spencer Brine, a depressed obituarist whose
star-crossed love for a local stripper provides
him the inspiration for an unlikely rise through
the papers ranks; widower Todd Tisdale, lost in former glories, who pins his hopes for saving his struggling tuxedo shop on befriending Arnold, no matter what it takes;
and finally, Rowena Pickett, a directionless
tanning salon employee who only wants to
find loveeven if its with a prison pen pal
she cant touch.&lt;p&gt;
As these characters lives intersect, often
in unexpectedly fateful ways, David Prybils
darkly humorous work examines both the
rough underbelly of dashed hopes and the
enduring power of the American Dream." />
