After World War II baseball was king in America as well as in Butte. As result, it can serve as a metaphor for life, holding out infinite possibilites because of its freedom from the ticking of the clock. To score a run the ballplayer must return to home plate, the place from which he started. Similarly, to complete our own journey &quot;around the horn,&quot; we must, as T. S. Eliot reminds us, return to the point from which we started and know the place for the first time. &lt;i&gt;Around the Horn&lt;/i&gt; celebrates the adventure and shows us the way." />
