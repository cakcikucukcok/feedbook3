  <title>Things You&#39;ve Inherited From Your Mother - Hollie Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone deals with grief in their own personal way. Take Carrie, for example. Getting over her mother&#39;s death from ovarian cancer takes the form of ramping up passive-aggressive office warfare, continuing her campaign to show her ex-husband she&#39;s over him (further increasing the distance between herself and her teenage daughter, natch), ridding herself of her mother&#39;s overweight cat Poncho, and consuming heroic quantities of red wine, spiked coffee and coffin nails. Nobody&#39;s perfect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Situated at the midpoint between the booze-soaked mayhem of Absolutely Fabulous and the middle-aged ennui of Anakana Schofield&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Malarky&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Things You&#39;ve Inherited From Your Mother&lt;/i&gt; is a riotous assemblage of found objects, Choose Your Own Adventure-style in jokes and useful facts about mice. In her startlingly funny first novel, Hollie Adams takes the conventional wisdom about &quot;likeable&quot; literary heroines and shoves it down an elevator shaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Things You&#39;ve Inherited From Your Mother&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hollie Adams has boldly tossed most first-novel conventions out the window.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Traci Skuce, &lt;i&gt;The Coastal Spectator&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Accessible, energetic and humorous!&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Angie Abdou, &lt;i&gt;Quill &amp; Quire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;At its best, Things You&#39;ve Inherited From Your Mother realizes the inability of some people - we all know one or two - to be authentic, with the genuine humanity behind their smarminess only peeking through in times of disaster.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Bryn Evans, &lt;i&gt;Alberta Views&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
