          &lt;strong&gt;WRONG TWIN &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jarrid Browning thought he&#39;d gotten over the woman who had once jilted him, but now she was back - lying in his arms, wearing next to nothing, clinging to him for dear life. Seeing her again reignited his still-smoldering desires, and he vowed he&#39;d never lose her again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;RIGHT BRIDE &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the woman Jarrid thought was his old flame was really her identical twin, Becky Lawson. And the usually shy Becky was falling hard for her persistent suitor, whose kisses made her toss all caution aside. But how could she convince him she was the woman he truly wanted once he discovered her charade?&lt;/p&gt;
