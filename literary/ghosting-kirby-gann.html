  <title>Ghosting - Kirby Gann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;A novelist of daring creativity and passion.&quot;&amp;#151;Edmund White&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dying drug kingpin enslaved to the memory of his dead wife; a young woman torn between a promising future and the hardscrabble world she grew up in; a mother willing to do anything to fuel her addiction to pills; and her youngest son, searching for the truth behind his older brother&#39;s disappearance, are just some of the unforgettable characters that populate &lt;I&gt;Ghosting&lt;/I&gt;, Kirby Gann&#39;s lush and lyrical novel of family and community, and the ties that can both bond and betray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fleece Skaggs has disappeared, along with drug dealer Lawrence Gruel&#39;s reefer harvest. Deciding that the best way to discover what happened to his older brother is to take his place as a drug runner for Gruel, James Cole plunges into a dark underworld of drugs, violence, and long hidden family secrets, where discovering what happened to his brother could cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A genre-subverting literary mystery told from the alternating viewpoint of different characters, &lt;I&gt;Ghosting&lt;/I&gt; is both a simple quest for the truth&amp;#151;what exactly happened to Fleece Skaggs?&amp;#151;and a complex consideration of human frailty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Kirby Gann &lt;/B&gt;is the author of the novels &lt;I&gt;The Barbarian Parade &lt;/I&gt;and &lt;I&gt;Our Napoleon in Rags &lt;/I&gt;(Ig Publishing, 2005).
