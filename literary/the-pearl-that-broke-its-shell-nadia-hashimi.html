  <title>The Pearl that Broke Its Shell - Nadia Hashimi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Afghan-American Nadia Hashimi&amp;#39;s literary debut novel is a searing tale of powerlessness, fate, and the freedom to control one&amp;#39;s own fate that combines the cultural flavor and emotional resonance of the works of Khaled Hosseini, Jhumpa Lahiri, and Lisa See.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Kabul, 2007, with a drug-addicted father and no brothers, Rahima and her sisters can only sporadically attend school, and can rarely leave the house. Their only hope lies in the ancient custom of &lt;em&gt;bacha posh&lt;/em&gt;, which allows young Rahima to dress and be treated as a boy until she is of marriageable age. As a son, she can attend school, go to the market, and chaperone her older sisters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Rahima is not the first in her family to adopt this unusual custom. A century earlier, her great-great grandmother, Shekiba, left orphaned by an epidemic, saved herself and built a new life the same way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crisscrossing in time, &lt;em&gt;The Pearl the Broke Its Shell&lt;/em&gt; interweaves the tales of these two women separated by a century who share similar destinies. But what will happen once Rahima is of marriageable age? Will Shekiba always live as a man? And if Rahima cannot adapt to life as a bride, how will she survive?&lt;/p&gt;" />
