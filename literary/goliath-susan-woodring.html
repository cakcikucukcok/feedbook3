  <title>Goliath - Susan Woodring</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Percy Harding, Goliath&#39;s most important citizen, is discovered dead by the railroad tracks outside town one perfect autumn afternoon, no one can quite believe it&#39;s really happened. Percy, the president of the town&#39;s world-renowned furniture company, had seemed invincible. Only Rosamond Rogers, Percy&#39;s secretary, may have had a glimpse of how and why this great man has fallen, and that glimpse tugs at her, urges her to find out more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Percy isn&#39;t the first person to leave Rosamond: everybody seems to, from her husband, Hatley, who walked out on her years ago; to her complicated daughter Agnes, whose girlhood bedroom was papered with maps of the places she wanted to escape to. The town itself is Rosamond&#39;s anchor, but it is beginning to quiver with the possibility of change. The high school girls are writing suicide poetry. The town&#39;s young, lumbering sidewalk preacher is courting Rosamond&#39;s daughter. A troubled teenaged boy plans to burn Main Street to the ground. And the furniture factory itself--the very soul of Goliath--threatens to close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the wake of the town&#39;s undoing, Rosamond seeks to reunite the grief-shaken community. &lt;i&gt;Goliath&lt;/i&gt;, a story of loss and love, of forgiveness and letting go, is a lyrical swoon of a novel by an exceptionally talented newcomer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
