  <title>Note for Note (Another Pentateuch) - Book 2 - Marcus M. Cornelius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Described as a work of literary genius in which the reader is led to a place almost beyond the capacities of language, &lt;i&gt;Note for Note (Another Pentateuch) - Book 1: Plough&lt;/i&gt; spoke of the attempted search for consciousness of primeval being born of and surrounded by apparent incoherence.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Growth&lt;/i&gt;, the second book of &lt;i&gt;Note for Note&lt;/i&gt;, explores the self subsumed by community, separation of self from community, and the exercising of choice amongst the fragility of a derived or assumed order that comes under threat. &lt;p&gt;
Ranweh, the Keeper of the Song, prepares to instruct Aimin, the keeper of the child, who is to be the main performer at the years most significant ceremony, an event that sanctifies the order that has been intuited from chaos and apparent incoherence. Unbeknownst to Ranweh, a taboo has been broken, contradicting the order that is taken as read, the very order that the ceremony celebrates. For the first time in living memory the Protector will not preside over the rites because he has no choice but to be elsewhere. The events take place downstream from and some centuries after the events in &lt;i&gt;Book 1: Plough&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Note for Note (Another Pentateuch) - Book 1: Plough&lt;/i&gt; has already been published through i-Universe who will also publish the other three books, &lt;i&gt;Book 3: Harvest&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Book 4: Snow&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Book 5: Scatter&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;p&gt;
