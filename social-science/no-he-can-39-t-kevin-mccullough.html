  <title>No He Can&#39;t - Kevin McCullough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Accepting his party&#39;s presidential nomination in the summer of 2008, Barack Obama beamed while Denver&#39;s stadium rocked with gauzy chants from adoring admirers. But looming beyond the deafening roar was a harsh reality that too few were willing to face just yet: Some &quot;hope&quot; is too audacious to believe, and just because a smooth talker proclaims something, doesn&#39;t make it true. &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;Now, long after the honeymoon has ended and the national mood soured toward the 44th U.S. president, nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist Kevin McCullough?the first pundit to predict Obama&#39;s rise to the presidency?provides an alarming perspective on the man he has watched closely since the aspiring commander-in-chief was an obscure community organizer on Chicago&#39;s South Side. You&#39;ll learn:&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt; &lt;UL&gt; &lt;LI&gt;How Barack Obama&#39;s first act as president to sign into law taxpayer-funded abortion&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;How his administration has systematically and intentionally created federal dependents&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;Why Obama&#39;s actions prove he believes American Exceptionalism is a myth&lt;/LI&gt; &lt;LI&gt;The outrageous lengths the president is willing to go to as he undermines our national security&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;From Obama&#39;s radical economic policy and dubious skills in national security to his administration&#39;s disdain for individual liberty and constitutional constraints on the power of the executive branch, McCullough lays out a convincing case for why, early on, he labeled Obama &quot;one of the most dangerous politicians our generation will see.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;Real&lt;/I&gt; hope is possible. While delving into Obama&#39;s flawed governance, McCullough also charts a way out, and forward, for the America that once was and can be again. &amp;nbsp;It is a way of clarity and common sense in a tried-and-true direction?a way that is diametrically opposed to the disappointing course set by the current resident of the Oval Office.&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />

But looming beyond the deafening roar was a harsh reality that too few were willing to face just yet: Some "hope" is too audacious to believe, and just because a smooth talker proclaims something, doesn't make it true. </p><p> Now, long after the honeymoon has ended and the national mood soured toward the 44th U.S. president, nationally syndicated radio talk-show host and columnist Kevin McCullough?the first pundit to predict Obama's rise to the presidency?provides an alarming perspective on the man he has watched closely since the aspiring commander-in-chief was an obscure community organizer on Chicago's South Side. You'll learn: <ul> <li>How Barack Obama's first act as president to sign into law taxpayer-funded abortion</li> <li>How his administration has systematically and intentionally created federal dependents</li> <li>Why Obama's actions prove he believes American Exceptionalism is a myth</li> <li>The outrageous lengths the president is willing to go to as he undermines our national security</li></ul> From Obama's radical economic policy and dubious skills in national security to his administration's disdain for individual liberty and constitutional constraints on the power of the executive branch, McCullough lays out a convincing case for why, early on, he labeled Obama "one of the most dangerous politicians our generation will see."   <i>Real</i> hope is possible. While delving into Obama's flawed governance, McCullough also charts a way out, and forward, for the America that once was and can be again.  It is a way of clarity and common sense in a tried-and-true direction?a way that is diametrically opposed to the disappointing course set by the current resident of the Oval Office. </p><p></p>
