  <title>Aviation Maintenance Technician – General - Dale Crane, Sean Fortier, Terry Michmerhuizen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Aviation Maintenance Technician: General is the first book of Dale Crane&#39;s AMT Series, textbooks that were created to set the pace for maintenance technician training and attain a level of quality that surpasses all other maintenance textbooks on the market. The General text covers the first section of the FAA&#39;s required curriculum, incorporating an introduction to aviation along with basic lessons on mathematics, physics, and electricity. As the student progresses, specific aviation concerns are addressed, including regulations, mechanic privileges, forms, aircraft hardware and tools. Dale Crane&#39;s textbooks consist of the most complete and up-to-date material for A&amp;P training. The curriculum meets 14 CFR Part 147 requirements and Subject Matter Knowledge Codes from the FAA mechanics knowledge tests. They are designed for at-home, classroom, or university-level training. These comprehensive textbooks include full-color charts, tables and illustrations throughout, in addition to an extensive glossary, index, and additional career information. A study guide is included within each textbook in the form of study question sections, with answer keys printed at the end of each chapter. These can be used for evaluation by an instructor or for self-testing. ASA&#39;s mechanic textbooks are all-inclusive -- no separate, inconvenient workbook is needed by the student or instructor." />
