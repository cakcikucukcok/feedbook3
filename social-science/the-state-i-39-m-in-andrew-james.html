  <title>The State I&#39;m In - Andrew James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Andrew James writes about the wretched life of an individual taxed too heavily by an abusive and excessive U.S. government.  The main character of the story, Andrew Henry, resides in rural upstate New York and in his diary he writes:  &#39;In a capitalistic society, the government should create and enforce laws, not redistribute the wealth.  To give to one person, it must take from another, and for average income earners and the working poor, this burden is too great.  The U.S. government has become a socialist regime, as opposed to a capitalistic state, and its quest for control of America&#39;s money has elevated its involvement in the economy to a level that borders on communism.  Not only is the government&#39;s extreme redistribution of wealth unfair, it should be illegal since the current &lt;U&gt;collective&lt;/U&gt; tax rate of 59.1 percent infringes on the dreams, ambitions, and desires of working families and individuals  (see pp. 12 &amp; 14).  Also, the designed inequities of the American tax system discriminate against, and persecute, certain citizenry.  In the United States of America, discrimination in any form should be illegal.&#39;    &lt;/P&gt;  &lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;Later in the story, America is attacked by a substantial multinational invasion force.  Henry finds shelter in an Ohio fallout shelter while his wife and daughter find shelter in an upstate New York fallout shelter.  The many countries harboring past grievances with the United States strike with surprising strategic planning and accuracy.  While in the shelter, Henry is protected from the fallout generated from this limited nuclear attack.  Henry describes the shelter construction and protective qualities.  &lt;/P&gt;  &lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;This book offers a scholarly insight to the culture of rural upstate New York and other American communities that feel overwhelmed by our current tax system.  It also lends insight to where we may be heading, as a peace-loving nation, in a militarily volatile world. &lt;/P&gt;  &lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;IT IS A &#39;MUST READ&#39; FOR:&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;P&gt;Politicians&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;P&gt;Military Personnel&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;P&gt;Scholars&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;P&gt;Every U.S. Citizen.&lt;/P&gt;  &lt;/B&gt;&lt;P ALIGN=&#39;JUSTIFY&#39;&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
