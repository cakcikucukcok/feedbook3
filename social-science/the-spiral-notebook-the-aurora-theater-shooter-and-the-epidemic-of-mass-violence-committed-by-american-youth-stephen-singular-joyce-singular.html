  <title>The Spiral Notebook: The Aurora Theater Shooter and the Epidemic of Mass Violence Committed by American Youth - Stephen Singular, Joyce Singular</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;On July 20, 2012, twelve people were killed and fifty-eight wounded at a mass shooting in a movie theater in Colorado. In 1999, thirteen kids at Columbine High School were murdered by their peers. In 2012, twenty children and seven adults were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary. Thirty-two were killed at Virginia Tech. Twelve killed at the Washington Navy Yard. In May 2014, after posting a YouTube video of &amp;#145;retribution&amp;#8221; and lamenting a life of &amp;#147;loneliness, rejection, and unfulfilled desires,&amp;#8221; a lone gunman killed six and wounded seven in Isla Vista. All of these acts of violence were committed by young men between the ages of eighteen and thirty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Mass violence committed by young people is now an epidemic. In the first fourteen school days of 2014, there were seven school shootings, compared to twenty-eight school shootings in all of 2013.
