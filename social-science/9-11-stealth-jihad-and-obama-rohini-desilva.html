  <title>9/11, Stealth Jihad and Obama - Rohini DeSilva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote this book for you. You are
worried, Is Obama really a Muslim?
What is happening to this country?
I answer, Yes he is. He is destroying
America. You exclaim, Surely not
deliberately? I answer, Obama is
waging a Stealth Jihad on this country.
Read this book. You will see for
yourself.
You ask, How can you know? Youre just a foreigner. I
reply, I watched as Socialists destroyed Sri Lanka. Also,
since I graduated with honors from Columbia Law School,
I can explain clearly how Shariah is diametrically opposed
to our Constitution. Islam is not a religion, but a political/
military/religious ideology that seeks to conquer America,
just as it has conquered Europe.
You complain, This book is too long. It is long because
there is so much the media has hidden. You need to read
the book and inform yourself. Then, liberal intellectuals
cannot deceive you any more.
You are afraid, The Media says I should not read this book
because you are a racist, full of hate and an Islamophobe.
I can only tell you, God gave me the courage to write this
book. I know He will give you the courage to read it." />
