  <title>Women in the Qur&#39;an - Asma Lamrabet, Myriam Francois-Cerrah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, the issue of Muslim women is held hostage between two perceptions: a conservative Islamic approach and a liberal Western approach. At the heart of this debate Muslim women are seeking to reclaim their right to speak in order to re-appropriate their own destinies, calling for the equality and liberation that is at the heart of the Qur&#39;an.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with few female commentators on the meaning of the Qur&#39;an and an overreliance on the readings of the Qur&#39;an compiled centuries ago this message is often lost. In this book Asma Lamrabet demands a rereading of the Qur&#39;an by women that focuses on its spiritual and humanistic messages in order to alter the lived reality on the ground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By acknowledging the oppression of women, to different degrees, in social systems organized in the name of religion and also rejecting a perspective that seeks to promote Western values as the only means of liberating them, the author is able to define a new way. One in which their refusal to remain silent is an act of devotion and their demand for reform will lead to liberation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Asma Lamarbet &lt;/B&gt;is a pathologist in Avicenna Hospital, Rabat, Morocco. She is also an award-winning author of many articles and books tackling Islam and women&#39;s issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Myriam Francois-Cerrah &lt;/B&gt;is a writer and broadcaster whose articles have been published in the &lt;I&gt;Guardian&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Salon&lt;/I&gt;, and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
