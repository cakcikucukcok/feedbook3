  <title>Rearing Wolves to Our Own Destruction - Midori Takagi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;RICHMOND WAS NOT only the capital of Virginia and of the Confederacy; it was also
    one of the most industrialized cities south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Boasting ironworks, tobacco
    processing plants, and flour mills, the city by 1860 drew half of its male workforce from the
    local slave population. &lt;i&gt;Rearing Wolves to Our Own Destruction&lt;/i&gt; examines this
    unusual urban labor system from 1782 until the end of the Civil War. Many urban bondsmen and
    women were hired to businesses rather than working directly for their owners. As a result, they
    frequently had the opportunity to negotiate their own contracts, to live alone, and to keep a
    portion of their wages in cash. Working conditions in industrial Richmond enabled
    African-American men and women to build a community organized around family networks, black
    churches, segregated neighborhoods, secret societies, and aid organizations. Through these
    institutions, Takagi demonstrates, slaves were able to educate themselves and to develop their
    political awareness. They also came to expect a degree of control over their labor and lives.
    Richmond&#39;s urban slave system offered blacks a level of economic and emotional support not
    usually available to plantation slaves. &lt;i&gt;Rearing Wolves to Our Own Destruction
    &lt;/i&gt;offers a valuable portrait of urban slavery in an individual city that raises
    questions about the adaptability of slavery as an institution to an urban setting and, more
    importantly, the ways in which slaves were able to turn urban working conditions to their own
    advantage.&lt;/p&gt;" />
