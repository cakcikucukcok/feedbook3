  <title>Naked at the Mic / - L.A. Steel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; NAKED AT THE MIC / The Survival of a Liberal in a Time of Peril, &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; is a book based upon10 years of exhaustive research and personal experiences , collected in an autobiographical and historical, account of the national and international politics, and the national , social upheaval during the Conservative Revolution. That political movement of Bush Fascism during the first decade of the 21st Century, as I witnessed and reported it on my television and radio programs, and my website www.lasteelshow.org during the years of 2000 to 2009. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naked at the Mic is also a public compliment, to the many people who fought valiantly to print and broadcast truth, and liberal commentary, while the entire broadcast media was dominated and censored of  Liberal Thought, by the Conservative right wing media, the G.W Bush administration, and the cabal of Muslim hating warmongers, famously known as the NeoCons. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naked at the Mic also commemorates the many heroic members of activist and citizen action groups and organizations , that fight daily to protect themselves and their country from the insanity of G.W Bushs administration,  and his minions, and their nightmare reality of war , genocide and slaughter in the Middle East, and the cruel, corrupt and oppressive, government they imposed on the American people during their reign of terror and torture from 2000 to 2008. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  I speak honestly about the 2008 presidential candidates and the election of Barack Obama, and why I voted for him, and my great disappointment, after his horrific betrayal of all who elected him. The research for Naked at the Mic entailed over 5000 news articles that I have personally archived and preserved on paper, to verify every quote and reference I make, and over 100 books and over 500 recorded interviews with authors, activists and politicians on 550 archived radio shows, ten televised documentaries , and 400 television programs I had produced up to 2009, when I completed  this book. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naked at the Mic , is an honest look back through time at people and events, that have been at the forefront of national and world changing events. This book is a historical record of one of the most volatile decades in American and world history. It reports and comments on many of the most important national and international issues from 2000 to 2009. I discuss in detail the corrupt 2000 presidential election, 911, the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions, Katrina, and expose the massive corporate, financial and political corruption and mass media cover ups, until the end of 2009. I honestly expose left and right wing politics, and give a unique front line perspective of the massive sea change of American Society, that caused G.W Bushs 75 percent approval rating in 2001, to his final approval rating of 24% in 2008. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Naked at the Mic / The Survival of a Liberal in a Time of Peril, is honest, fast moving, highly informative and well researched, and is an accurate, historical account of the characters involved with one of the longest running  liberal radio shows in  America during one of the most politically conservative, and most destructive periods in American history, that has led to the current economic, military and moral demise of America. &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Ralph Waldo Emerson once stated in his essay The Oversoul Oh, Believe that every word that was meant for thine ear to hear will come to thee. &lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I believe a lot of people are meant to hear what this book has to say. &lt;p&gt;
