  <title>Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Risk Assessment Via Research Proposal (3Rd Ed.) - Wayne L. Davis, Robert E. Moldenhauer, Heather D. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book discusses issues related to terrorism and suggests how to perform risk assessment via academic research.  First, this book discusses several behavioral disorders and theories related to crime.  Theories are important because they describe the problem, they control the survey questions during a study (the instrument must be valid), and they provide possible solutions to the problem.  Second, this book discusses terrorism and risk management, emergency response, HazMat scenes, agroterrorism, and some of the pros and cons of different strategies for managing terrorism.   Finally, this book shows how to investigate a problem via academic research.  Several research proposal examples are provided.  Reading about a problem is good, but knowing how to solve a problem is better.  What the readers will come to realize is that there are many assumptions and limitations related to a study, which may impact the credibility of the study.   Hence, readers will come to realize the value of scholarly, peer-reviewed articles." />
