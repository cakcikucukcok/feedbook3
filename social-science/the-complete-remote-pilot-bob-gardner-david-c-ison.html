  <title>The Complete Remote Pilot - Bob Gardner, David C. Ison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This textbook is for anyone interested in pursuing and obtaining an FAA Remote Pilot Certificate which is a  requirement for operating drones in commercial uses. The authors explain in a friendly, readable style, all the details involved in the adventure of becoming a remote pilot and learning to fly a small unmanned aircraft system (sUAS). Passing the FAA Knowledge Exam is required to earn a remote pilot certificate. This text is designed to not only comprehensively prepare you for the exam but to also teach you how a UAS flies, how to intelligently talk about them and their components and be well versed in the aeronautical knowledge required to fly these systems in the same airspace as large commercial jets. Covers the language of drones, regulations, airspace and navigation, airport and off-airport operations, radio communication procedures, weather, aerodynamics and aircraft performance, emergency procedures, human factors, maintenance and preflight inspection procedures.
The required aeronautical knowledge is augmented with specific tips and techniques, checklists and mnemonic devices, and sound advice from personal experience. Each chapter concludes with review questions similar to the type found on the FAA test, and a glossary and index are included. This practical application of the FAA Knowledge Exam is not available in any other book and you will gain the knowledge needed to pass the test and understand how to operate safely as a remote pilot in the U.S. National Airspace System." />
