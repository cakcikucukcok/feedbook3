  <title>Rings of Misfortune - Lloyd Duncan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Over 16,000,000 men served in the armed forces in WWII.  Perhaps as many as 3%, or 480,000, had a homosexual orientation. Admittedly, several thousand were screened out before being inducted, and some later received Undesirable Discharges. 120,000 of these men saw combat action, and undoubtedly hundreds were killed, and thousands were wounded.&lt;/p&gt;
             &lt;p&gt;Jack Scott, by far the most outstanding seventeen-year-old in a small town in Arkansas, is forced to confront this problem both at home and in the military. This story is his, and to a degree, the stories of his family, his friends, and his comrades in combat. &lt;/p&gt; 
             &lt;p&gt; The problem is handled sympathetically, if realistically.&lt;/p&gt;" />
