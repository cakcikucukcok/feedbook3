  <title>Beckoned by the Sea - Sylvia Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A rich and diverse tapestry weaving together the many voices, narratives, skills, and talents of women up and down the coastal Pacific Northwest who devote their lives and careers to the sea.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beckoned by the Sea&lt;/i&gt; celebrates coastal women from northern BC to northern California who work on or with the sea. The twenty-four women featured in this inspiring and fascinating book represent a variety of industries—from conservation, commercial fishing, and marine biology to safety and rescue, tourism, and the arts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weaving together elements of social history, culture, geography, and environmentalism, author Sylvia Taylor draws on in-depth interviews, meticulous research, and her own experience as a deckhand on a commercial fishing boat. &lt;i&gt;Beckoned by the Sea&lt;/i&gt; investigates the myriad ways in which women have contributed to the marine industries that sustain the people and shape the culture of North America’s west coast—and reveals how the sea itself has touched the lives of these women by giving them not just a livelihood but an infinite source of inspiration and personal fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
