He shares clairvoyant incidents that happened in the early days and some of the truly frightening paranormal experiences he has had.

Psychic Scotland takes us to some famous and not-so-famous haunted locations where the reader can relive Tom&amp;amp;#8217;s experiences and the emotions he feels as long-dead spirits make themselves known. Tom also describes the different methods that can be used for &amp;amp;#145;tuning in&amp;amp;#8217; to a place with paranormal activity and explains how you can decipher what is fact and what is fiction when investigating ghostly phenomena. Psychic Scotland is a unique piece of work within this field. It is a history book, an autobiography and a paranormal guidebook all rolled into one astonishing journey.&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;" />
