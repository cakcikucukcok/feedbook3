  <title>What Kind of America - R. Eugene Spitzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is an excellent book for people who are tired and fed up with what they see happening to their country. Whether its failing schools, a failing federal government, a failing economy, huge debt, and massive unemployment, youll want to read this book.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Hollywood is a cesspool, likened to Soddom and Gomorrah, RAP music offends almost everyone, and is full of degrading lyrics; the whole alternative energy push by this President is a scam; man-made global warming is another big scam, and Al Gore is making tens of millions of dollars from it. Whats all this stuff about diversity being good for America? Show me. You want alternative energy to replace oil? Itll be here in about 25 years; get over it. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Our federal government is broken, out of control, and arrogant, and unable to effectively govern. We should toss them all out and start over, using the Constitution as the standard for office. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Its all in here, and it is most assuredly politically incorrect. The author does not subscribe to Cultural Marxism from which politically correct evolved. If you are easily offended, dont read this book because if youre offended, its your problem, not his. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This is volume 1 in what the author believes will be a 3-volume set, and he goes after all of the bad people, bad groups, and bad ideas. &lt;/p&gt;" />
