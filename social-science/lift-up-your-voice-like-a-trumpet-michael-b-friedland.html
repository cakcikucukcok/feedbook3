  <title>Lift Up Your Voice Like a Trumpet - Michael B. Friedland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the Supreme Court declared in 1954 that segregated public&lt;br/&gt;schools were unconstitutional, the highest echelons of&lt;br/&gt;Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish religious organizations&lt;br/&gt;enthusiastically supported the ruling, and black civil rights&lt;br/&gt;workers expected and actively sought the cooperation of their&lt;br/&gt;white religious cohorts. Many white southern clergy, however,&lt;br/&gt;were outspoken in their defense of segregation, and even those&lt;br/&gt;who supported integration were wary of risking their positions by&lt;br/&gt;urging parishioners to act on their avowed religious beliefs in a&lt;br/&gt;common humanity. Those who did so found themselves abandoned by friends, attacked by white supremacists, and often driven from&lt;br/&gt;their communities. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;     Michael Friedland here offers a collective biography of several&lt;br/&gt;southern and nationally known white religious leaders who did&lt;br/&gt;step forward to join the major social protest movements of the&lt;br/&gt;mid-twentieth century, lending their support first to the civil&lt;br/&gt;rights movement and later to protests over American involvement&lt;br/&gt;in Vietnam. Profiling such activists as William Sloane Coffin&lt;br/&gt;Jr., Daniel and Philip Berrigan, Abraham Joshua Heschel, Eugene&lt;br/&gt;Carson Blake, Robert McAfee Brown, and Will D. Campbell, he&lt;br/&gt;reveals the passions and commitment behind their involvement in these protests and places their actions in the context of a burgeoning ecumenical movement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
