  <title>Modernity&#39;s Ear - Roshanak Kheshti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;pastingspan1&quot;&gt;Fearing the rapid disappearance of indigenous cultures, twentieth-century American ethnographers turned to the phonograph to salvage native languages and musical practices. &amp;nbsp;Prominent among these early &amp;#8220;songcatchers&amp;#8221; were white women of comfortable class standing, similar to the female consumers targeted by the music industry as the gramophone became increasingly present in bourgeois homes.

Taking a mixed-methods approach that draws on anthropology and sound studies, Kheshti locates sound as both representative &amp;nbsp;and constitutive of culture and power. Through analyses of film, photography, recordings, and radio, as well as ethnographic fieldwork at a San Francisco-based world music company, Kheshti politicizes the feminine in the contemporary world music industry. &amp;nbsp;Deploying critical theory to read the fantasy of the feminized listener and feminized organ of the ear, &lt;em&gt;Modernity&amp;#8217;s Ear&lt;/em&gt; ultimately explores the importance of pleasure in constituting the listening self.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
