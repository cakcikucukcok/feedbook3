  <title>New York to Okinawa Sloooooowly - John Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over many centuries, wars have been lost due to lack of food and proper supplies for the troops. Without a way to survive, the troops had to retreat rather than stay and fight. The same need applied to ships at sea. &lt;i&gt;New York to Okinawa Sloooooowly&lt;/i&gt; is the true story of a soldier who served on one of the supply ships that were vital to the survival of the troops in battle during Wolrd War II.
John Barnes graduated from high school in 1941. While many of the kids in his class headed off to college, that was not Johns plan. He wanted to join the marines, but when he discovered that his mother would not sign the papers, he set his sights on the US Coast Guard, the same service as his favorite cousin, Frank. After his basic training, he and his shipmates headed out on a journey that would ultimately take them to Okinawa. 
Through the severe storms, typhoons and enemy aircraft attacks, they got the job done come hell or high water." />
