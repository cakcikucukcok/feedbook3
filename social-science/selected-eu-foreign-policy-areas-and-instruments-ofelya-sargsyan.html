  <title>Selected EU Foreign Policy Areas and Instruments - Ofelya Sargsyan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="To read, to inform, to learn - this is the purpose of this new LIBERTAS Paper, which can be used for university studies, by students, scientists, and above all by everybody who wants to inform him/herself about the European Union. It contains articles about EU Foreign and Defence Policy, with many examples of also external aspects of traditional domestic policies, and it shows that the EU needs more common foreign policy than less. Another article covers the OCTs - the overseas countries and territories (spread over the globe and held by France, Denmark, Netherlands and the United Kingdom). The author shows an incredible multitude of communities - from Wallis &amp; Futuna in the South Pacific until Aruba in the Caribbean. The Arctic region and its integration and relation to the EU is another chapter which becomes very topical in the moment. A second part of the booklet deals with methodological approaches for external soft power. with an overview on plurinational attempts in the EU and their &quot;export capacity&quot; (e.g. Latin America), participatory democracy, and the role of non-State actors ensuring human security - with the example of South Sudan." />
