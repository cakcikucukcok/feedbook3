  <title>The Lynching - Laurence Leamer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;bestselling author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Kennedy Women&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;chronicles the powerful and spellbinding true story of a brutal race-based killing in 1981 and subsequent trials that undid one of the most pernicious organizations in American history&amp;#8212;the Ku Klux Klan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a Friday night in March 1981 Henry Hays and James Knowles scoured the streets of Mobile in their car, hunting for a black man. The young men were members of Klavern 900 of the United Klans of America. They were seeking to retaliate after a largely black jury could not reach a verdict in a trial involving a black man accused of the murder of a white man. The two Klansmen found nineteen-year-old Michael Donald walking home alone. Hays and Knowles abducted him, beat him, cut his throat, and left his body hanging from a tree branch in a racially mixed residential neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrested, charged, and convicted, Hays was sentenced to death&amp;#8212;the first time in more than half a century that the state of Alabama sentenced a white man to death for killing a black man. On behalf of Michael&amp;#8217;s grieving mother, Morris Dees, the legendary civil rights lawyer and cofounder of the Southern Poverty Law Center, filed a civil suit against the members of the local Klan unit involved and the UKA, the largest Klan organization. Charging them with conspiracy, Dees put the Klan on trial, resulting in a verdict that would level a deadly blow to its organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on numerous interviews and extensive archival research,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Lynching&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;brings to life two dramatic trials, during which the Alabama Klan&amp;#8217;s motives and philosophy were exposed for the evil they represent. In addition to telling a gripping and consequential story, Laurence Leamer chronicles the KKK and its activities in the second half the twentieth century, and illuminates its lingering effect on race relations in America today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lynching&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;includes sixteen pages of black-and-white photographs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
