  <title>The Bitch Is Back - Cathi Hanauer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;More than a decade after the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling anthology &lt;em&gt;The Bitch in the House&lt;/em&gt; spoke up loud and clear for a generation of young woman, nine of the original contributors are back&amp;#8212;along with sixteen captivating new voices&amp;#8212;sharing their ruminations from an older, stronger, and wiser perspective about love, sex, work, family, independence, body-image, health, and aging: the critical flash points of women&amp;#8217;s lives today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Born out of anger,&quot; the essays in &lt;em&gt;The Bitch in the House&lt;/em&gt; chronicled the face of womanhood at the beginning of a new millennium. Now those funny, smart, passionate contributors&amp;#8212;today less bitter and resentful, and more confident, competent, and content&amp;#8212;capture the spirit of postfeminism in this equally provocative, illuminating, and compelling companion anthology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having aged into their forties, fifties, and sixties, these &quot;bitches&quot;&amp;#8212;bestselling authors, renowned journalists, and critically acclaimed novelists&amp;#8212;are back . . . and better than ever. In &lt;em&gt;The Bitch Is Back&lt;/em&gt;, Cathi Hanauer, Kate Christensen, Sarah Crichton, Debora Spar, Ann Hood, Veronica Chambers, and nineteen other women offer unique views on womanhood and feminism today. Some of the &quot;original bitches&quot; (OBs) revisit their earlier essays to reflect on their previous selves. All reveal how their lives have changed in the intervening years&amp;#8212;whether they stayed coupled, left marriages, or had affairs; developed cancer or other physical challenges; coped with partners who strayed, died, or remained faithful; became full-time wage earners or homemakers; opened up their marriages; remained childless or became parents; or experienced other meaningful life transitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a &quot;new wave&quot; of feminists begins to take center stage, this powerful, timely collection sheds a much-needed light on both past and present, offering understanding, compassion, and wisdom for modern women&amp;#8217;s lives, all the while pointing toward the exciting possibilities of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
