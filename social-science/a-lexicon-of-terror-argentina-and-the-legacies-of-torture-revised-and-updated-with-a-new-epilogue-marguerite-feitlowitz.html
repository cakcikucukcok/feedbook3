  <title>A Lexicon of Terror: Argentina and the Legacies of Torture, Revised and Updated with a New Epilogue - Marguerite Feitlowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tanks roaring over farmlands, pregnant women tortured, 30,000 individuals disappeared--these were the horrors of Argentinas Dirty War. A New York Times Notable Book of the Year and Finalist for the L.L. Winship / PEN New England Award in 1998, A Lexicon of Terror is a sensitive and unflinching account of the sadism, paranoia, and deception the military junta unleashed on the Argentine people from 1976 to 1983.   This updated edition features a new epilogue that chronicles major political, legal, and social developments in Argentina since the books initial publication. It also continues the stories of the individuals involved in the Dirty War, including the torturers, kidnappers and murderers formerly granted immunity under now dissolved amnesty laws. Additionally, Feitlowitz discusses investigations launched in the intervening years that have indicated that the network of torture centers, concentration camps, and other operations responsible for the desaparecidas was more widespread than previously thought. A Lexicon of Terror vividly evokes this shocking era and tells of the long-lasting effects it has left on the Argentine culture." />
