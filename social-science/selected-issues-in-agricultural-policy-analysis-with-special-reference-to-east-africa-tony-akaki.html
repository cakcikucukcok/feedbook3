  <title>Selected Issues in Agricultural Policy Analysis with Special Reference to East Africa - Tony Akaki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book highlights some of the main areas of debate around the subject of agricultural policy in Eastern Africa. Its major aim is to introduce the reader to different issues of economic and social change arising from agricultural development and to provide an understanding of some of the major difficulties faced by African countries in pursuing an agricultural policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural policy is analyzed by creating a contextual framework in light of the major policy documents of the World Bank to formulate an understanding of the developmental issues pertaining to agriculture. This is not meant to be a comprehensive study of agricultural policy but a mode of analysis in which broad sector agricultural policies can be viewed as a potentially active agent of social change and development.&lt;/p&gt;" />
