  <title>Parris Electoral Conjectures and Governance in Guyana - Haslyn Parris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Parris Electoral Conjectures and Governance in Guyana&lt;/i&gt; examines the inappropriateness of treating Guyana as a society characterised by ethnic differences. Author Haslyn Parris, the former Deputy Prime Minister of Guyana, outlines his thoughts on the electoral system in Guyana and the ways in which it is used as a basis for determining societal opinion on who should govern the country. 
&lt;i&gt;Parris Electoral Conjectures and Governance in Guyana&lt;/i&gt; explores three main myths that comprise beliefs generally accepted by many Guyanese, regardless of their levels of intelligence or education. These myths are as follows:
1.	Guyana has a Westminster-model constitution and system of government.
2.	Voting in Guyana is along ethnic lines, so that elections very much represent something of an ethnic census.
3.	Leaders need to be intellectually blessed visionaries, thereby capable of giving guidance to the people on a broad range of issues.
Parriss study is divided into two parts; the first part examines the second and third myths as described above. The second part explores the first myth, regarding Guyanas system of government and proposes a new electoral system for Guyana. Throughout, Parris offers insightful suggestions regarding how Guyana can escape the morass into which the country has been thrown by its colonial history." />
