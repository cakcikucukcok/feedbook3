  <title>From a Culture of Dependency to a Culture of Success - Y.S. Wishnick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is an old story of a famous business tycoon that was near death.  His lifelong business partner approached him on his deathbed and asked if hed like to see his great grandchild.  The business executive opened his eyes and whispered in his associates ear, No, my friend, I do not want to know what Ive missed.
More and more Americans are missing out on the greatness of their country; its passion for excellence, its commitment to the dignity and self-worth of each individual, and its belief that every person has the right to achieve their own vision for success.  Chaos, confusion, disappointment, and hopelessness have pushed and pulled Americans into a state of dependency.  From the individual, to the family, to our local communities, Americans are constantly looking for others to solve the problems and challenges they face. This has lead to victimology, class warfare, and ultimately bad public policy where a culture of dependency is becoming the new normal. As people think themselves into believing that they cant make it on their own they are rejecting their own potential and capacity to act.  Worse, they are missing out on the person they were destined to become." />
