  <title>Tax Reform with the 20/20 Tax - James C. Tanner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Many books have been written about tax reform, but none offer the pragmatic and understandable approach that youll find in this treatise filled with a nonpartisan set of solutions to fix an antiquated and indecipherable tax system.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James C. Tanner, a certified public accountant with more than four decades of experience, explores how we can:&lt;/br&gt;
	Create a fair and logical tax framework by rethinking income exclusions, exemptions, deductions, credits, tax brackets, capital gains, and other tax alternatives;&lt;/br&gt;
	reform tax expenditures, including health insurance and medical costs, home mortgage and other interest deductions, retirement plan deductions, charitable donations, and capital gains on assets sold and transferred;&lt;/br&gt;
	lower the tax rates for most individual and corporate taxpayers while making our US companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tanner also outlines how historical decisions and legislative proposals led to our current tax laws under the premise that we cant fix them without understanding why they were created in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who want to participate in the national debate on federal tax reform, it begins with a firm understanding of the system and the practical proposals in Tax Reform with the 20/20 Tax.&lt;/p&gt;" />
