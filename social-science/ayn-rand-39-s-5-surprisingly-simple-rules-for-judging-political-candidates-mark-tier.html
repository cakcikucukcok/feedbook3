  <title>Ayn Rand&#39;s 5 Surprisingly Simple Rules for Judging Political Candidates - Mark Tier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ayn Rand on . . .&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ronald Reagan&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That so-and-so, claiming to be a defender of capitalism and Americanism, has come out against abortion. If he doesn&amp;rsquo;t respect so fundamental a right, he cannot be a defender of any kind of rights.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;rsquo;s what Rand said about Ronald Reagan at the Ford Hall Forum in 1976.&lt;br /&gt;
Reagan supported the right to abortion when he was governor of California&amp;mdash;and later changed his tune.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash;or Mitt Romney?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But those words apply equally to the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney. As governor of Massachusetts he supported the right to abortion&amp;mdash;and later changed his tune!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So we can confidently conclude Rand would have the same &amp;ldquo;That so-and-so&amp;rdquo; opinion of Mitt Romney.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jimmy Carter&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;[A] cheap, small town peanut power luster [who&amp;rsquo;s] been on both sides of every key issue.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;mdash;or Barack Obama?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rand&amp;rsquo;s opinion of Jimmy Carter applies equally to Barack Obama who, as president, broke most every election promise he made in the 2008 campaign&amp;mdash;with one main exception.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That was &amp;ldquo;Obamacare,&amp;rdquo; which Rand would have skewered with much the same words she used to tear apart George McGovern in 1972.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are just a few examples of Rand&amp;rsquo;s many statements we can adapt to current issues when the concrete referents are sufficiently similar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From her political writings we can also derive the &amp;ldquo;5 Surprisingly Simple Rules&amp;rdquo; she applied to judge politicians. When combined with her philosophy of Objectivism, we can have a pretty good idea what she&amp;rsquo;d probably say about today&amp;rsquo;s political issues&amp;mdash;even though she died in 1982.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the following pages we&amp;rsquo;ll apply &amp;ldquo;Rand&amp;rsquo;s Rules&amp;rdquo; to the 2012 American Presidential election as a case study.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And, in conclusion, you&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to apply those very same rules to parties and politicians everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So whether you agree with Ayn Rand or not, you&amp;rsquo;ll never be fooled by a politician again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
