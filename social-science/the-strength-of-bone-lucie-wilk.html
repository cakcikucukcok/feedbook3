  <title>The Strength of Bone - Lucie Wilk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;An Amazon.ca Best Book of 2013: Top 100/Editors&#39; Pick&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#147;A gorgeous debut.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;JOSEPH BOYDEN, author of &lt;I&gt;Through Black Spruce&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Orenda&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, Bryce is learning to predict the worst. Racing heart: infection, probably malaria. He&amp;#8217;ll send Iris for saline. Shortness of breath? TB. Another patient rolled to the ward. And the round swellings, the rashes with dimpled centres, the small rough patches on a boy&amp;#8217;s foot? HIV. Iris will make him comfortable. They&amp;#8217;ll move on.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then there will be sleeplessness, rationed energy, a censuring of hope: the doctor&amp;#8217;s disease. Iris sees that one all the time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Henry Bryce has come to Blantyre to work off the grief he feels for his old life, but he can&amp;#8217;t adjust to the hopelessness that surrounds him. He relies increasingly upon Sister Iris&amp;#8217;s steady presence. Yet it&amp;#8217;s not until an accident brings them both to a village outpost that Bryce realizes the personal sacrifices Iris has made for her medical training, or that Iris in turn comes to fathom the depth of Henry&amp;#8217;s loss.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Strength of Bone&lt;/I&gt; is the story of a Western doctor, a Malawian nurse, and the crises that push both of them to the brink of collapse. With biting emotion and a pathological eye for detail, novelist and medical doctor Lucie Wilk demonstrates how, in a place where knowledge can frustrate as often as it heals, true strength requires the flexibility to let go.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Advance Praise for &lt;I&gt;The Strength of Bone&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;In supple, beautiful prose, Lucie Wilk recounts a doctor&amp;#8217;s struggle with technology and faith, and with the mysteries of death and love &amp;#133; The Strength of Bone is an extraordinary look at the clash of worlds.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;ANNABEL LYON, author of &lt;I&gt;The Golden Mean&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Sweet Girl&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lucie Wilk grew up in Toronto and completed her medical training in Vancouver. Her short fiction has been nominated for the McClelland &amp; Stewart Journey Prize Anthology, longlisted for a CBC Canada Writes literary prize, and has appeared in Descant, Prairie Fire and Shortfire Press. She is working toward an MFA in Creative Writing at the University of British Columbia. She practices medicine and lives with her husband and two children in London, UK.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
