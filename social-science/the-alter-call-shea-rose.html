  <title>The Alter Call - Shea Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;What does a married black police officer and an unhappily married white rabbi have in common?  An attractive divorced black thirty-something female whos recently embarked on a torrid love affair.  These two men are as different as night and day but they  share the same sentiments about what Danielle Winters has gotten herself into  theyre the crutches who get her through the valley of the shadow of death.  But it becomes increasingly clear that yes, she should fear some evil.  The evil shes unwittingly drafted into her life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;In the throes of the good times with her hot new beau, Danielle begins to experience unusual tearjerker moments and out-of-the-ordinary occurrences that begin to take toll.  Realizing she needs a plan or two to help her through, her two comrades say and do all they can in hopes that shell wake up and smell the coffee.  Stephanie, her trusted cousin and confidant cant even offer any valuable advice.  Danielle even ignores her own intuition.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P ALIGN=&quot;JUSTIFY&quot;&gt;Its only after her unshakable &lt;I&gt;alter call&lt;/I&gt;, that she finally gets it.  She needed a life altering change and renewing of her thought process  something she would only achieve from having heeded the (Almightys) call to change her life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
