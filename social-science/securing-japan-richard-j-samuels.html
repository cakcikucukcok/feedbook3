  <title>Securing Japan - Richard J. Samuels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For the past sixty years, the U.S. government has assumed that Japan&#39;s security policies would reinforce American interests in Asia. The political and military profile of Asia is changing rapidly, however. Korea&#39;s nuclear program, China&#39;s rise, and the relative decline of U.S. power have commanded strategic review in Tokyo just as these matters have in Washington. What is the next step for Japan&#39;s security policy? Will confluence with U.S. interests-and the alliance-survive intact? Will the policy be transformed? Or will Japan become more autonomous?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Richard J. Samuels demonstrates that over the last decade, a revisionist group of Japanese policymakers has consolidated power. The Koizumi government of the early 2000s took bold steps to position Japan&#39;s military to play a global security role. It left its successor, the Abe government, to further define and legitimate Japan&#39;s new grand strategy, a project well under way-and vigorously contested both at home and in the region. &lt;em&gt;Securing Japan&lt;/em&gt; begins by tracing the history of Japan&#39;s grand strategy-from the Meiji rulers, who recognized the intimate connection between economic success and military advance, to the Konoye consensus that led to Japan&#39;s defeat in World War II and the postwar compact with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;P&gt;Samuels shows how the ideological connections across these wars and agreements help explain today&#39;s debate. He then explores Japan&#39;s recent strategic choices, arguing that Japan will ultimately strike a balance between national strength and national autonomy, a position that will allow it to exist securely without being either too dependent on the United States or too vulnerable to threats from China. Samuels&#39;s insights into Japanese history, society, and politics have been honed over a distinguished career and enriched by interviews with policymakers and original archival research. &lt;em&gt;Securing Japan&lt;/em&gt; is a definitive assessment of Japanese security policy and its implications for the future of East Asia.&lt;/p&gt;" />
