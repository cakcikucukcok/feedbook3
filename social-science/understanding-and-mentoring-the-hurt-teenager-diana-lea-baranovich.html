  <title>Understanding and Mentoring the Hurt Teenager - Diana–Lea Baranovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Understanding and Mentoring the Hurt Teenager, by author Diana-Lea Baranovich, offers a guide for all caring adults who wish to serve as a positive inspiration in the lives of hurt teenagers as they transition into young adulthood. Although its written from the point of view of underprivileged, hurt teenagers who are growing up in marginalized situations, it communicates that hurt teenagers come from all walks of life. They are not only from low-socioeconomic homes where they are being neglected, abused, and/or lack personal resources; many hurt teenagers can be found in affluent homes.
Geared toward teachers, probation officers, counselors, welfare workers, leaders of religious groups, community workers, and parents who care for or mentor hurt teenagers, Understanding and Mentoring the Hurt Teenager breaks ten myths surrounding the lives of hurt teenagers. It helps all understand the teens plight by showing what makes the hurt teenager think, act, react, and relate to others the way they do.
With discussion questions included, this guide assists adults to become a positive support system to help teens break the cycle of generational poverty, abuse, and neglect and journey more positively into adulthood." />
