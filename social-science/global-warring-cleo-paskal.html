  <title>Global Warring - Cleo Paskal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a perfect storm, the environment, the global economic system and geopolitics are all undergoing rapid, uncontrolled change. In the same way that the climate is in a state of flux, exhibiting erratic behavior before settling into a new norm, in the wake of the global economic crisis, many of the assumptions about the Western economic system have been destroyed, which leads to some troubling questions: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How aggressive will water-hungry China become in order to secure a sufficient supply of it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What will happen when climate-triggered conflicts like the one in Sudan spread throughout the continent? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As India takes its proper place at the high table of nations and begins large-scale importing of food, what will happen to already shrinking supplies?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Global Warring&lt;/i&gt; takes a hard look at these questions. Journalist and analyst Cleo Paskal identifies problem areas that are most likely to start wars, destroy economies and create failed states. Examining the most likely environmental change scenarios, she illuminates the ways in which they could radically alter human existence. A fascinating tour through our uncertain future, &lt;i&gt;Global Warring&lt;/i&gt; also offers a controversial new way forward for the global economy and the worldwide environmental crisis.&lt;/p&gt;" />
