  <title>The New Founding Fathers of a &quot;Network&quot; Solution - Edwin T. McPeak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New Founding Fathers of a &amp;quot;Network&amp;quot; Solution,&lt;/em&gt;is a book in which the author discusses the current controversial affairs that pertain to today&amp;#39;s government and its leaders, and introduces a viable solution to correct what many believe to be inadequacies possesed by these same leaders. This solution is revolutionary in scope, however the author attempts to illustrate the necessity for such radical change by bringing to the forefront the corruption and mismanagement of those elected to be in charge of government. He brings to light a new concept of &amp;quot;government of, for, and by the people.&amp;quot; Throughout the book he presents his vision of a computer network that allows the true voice of the people to be heard, but leaves the details of the &amp;quot;Network&amp;#39;s&amp;quot; creation up to the people he calls &amp;quot;New Founders,&amp;quot; in order to stay true to his concept of a democratic government &amp;quot;of the people.&amp;quot; Ultimately at the end of the book he does give his own rendition of how he believes this new form of government should function to benefit the country as a whole. It is a short read, but it is packed with information and insight.&lt;/p&gt;" />
