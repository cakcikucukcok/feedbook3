  <title>Enduring Heritage - Romeo P. Stockett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mentoring ensures heritage, tradition, and good conduct, which is why its become a codified form of a structured relationship.
Romeo P. Stockett, PhD, who was named Mentor of the Year for 2009 by the 100 Black Men of America, explores how mentoring has assisted and guided us through various events, circumstances, and tough times over the years. As someone who has directed military and civilian organizations, held positions in training and education, and is active in numerous mentoring practices, he knows the value of mentoring.
In this handbook, youll learn how to
	build a mentoring toolkit so you can help others;
	mentor for specific purposes and to varied groups; and
	differentiate between personal and professional mentoring.
As the roles of parents, coaches, teachers, and professional superiors change, it has never been more necessary for mentors to be active. Youths spend more time in front of electronic screens and with their peers than their family and loved ones, while young professionals arent getting the on-the-job guidance they need.
Take the advice of someone who has devoted his professional and personal life to helping others, and you can learn how to pass your knowledge and skills to those who need it the most." />
