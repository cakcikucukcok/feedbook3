  <title>Take the Power Back - Robert Brandon Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After serving as a United States Marine during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, Robert Brandon Cox realized his perspective had changed on how American freedom is interpreted around the world. Now, years after his service, yet still devoted to his lifelong promise to uphold and defend Americas freedom, Cox is breaking his silence. &lt;p&gt;
From the unique viewpoint of one who was there, Take the Power Back delivers an honest, forthright look at Americas involvement in Iraq from March 2003 to the present occupation. Cox dissects major aspects of Americas recent history, including Americas drug war, the Bush family empire, and American political propaganda, and ties together the loose threads of history to form a more complete picture of our current role in Iraq. &lt;p&gt;
Cox reveals how our dependence on oil has fueled both foreign and domestic policy and explores the U.S. governments systematic exploitation of power throughout the years. In addition, he offers ideas and solutions for the diplomatic problems plaguing our nation and parts the curtain behind Obamas presidency.&lt;p&gt;
Well-researched and deeply informative, Take the Power Back is a stirring call to action, one that will resonate within the heart of every American." />
