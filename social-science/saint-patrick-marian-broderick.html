  <title>Saint Patrick - Marian Broderick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An engaging and rich exploration of Saint Patrick and his extraordinary influence on the world.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forced into slavery at the age of fifteen, Patrick overcame all hardship to fulfil his calling: to bring the people of Ireland into the light of God&#39;s word. He carried out his mission of conversion and care at a crucial time of change, as Christianity spread across Romanised Europe and harnessed existing social structures and belief systems in Pagan Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patrick met high kings and mythical heroes, Celtic gods and goddesses, lowly farmers and loyal servants, and he left lasting marks upon the Irish landscape and way of life. He was humble, courageous and resourceful, and was the first of Ireland&#39;s saints to write down his experiences. Thus began the cult of Saint Patrick, galvanised over 1500 years of devotion and scholarship, and culminating recently in the cheerful &#39;greening&#39; of the world&#39;s most famous landmarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from recorded histories, &#39;tall tales&#39; from all four provinces and beautiful illustrations, this is a light-hearted look at the global phenomenon of Saint Patrick, his life and his legacy, the facts and the fiction of his incredible journey from slave to international saint.&lt;/p&gt;" />
