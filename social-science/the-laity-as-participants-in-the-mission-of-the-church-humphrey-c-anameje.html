  <title>The Laity as Participants in the Mission of the Church - Humphrey C. Anameje</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The church is made up of both the clergy and the laity. And for it to properly fulfill the mission for which it was instituted by Christ, all its members, each according to his or her God-given gift, must contribute both to the upbuilding of the church and to its mission. On the part of the laity, their active participation in the general mission of the church ad intra and ad extra has been a great challenge in the life and practice of the church throughout its history. The Second Vatican Council, in its spirit of aggiornamento, makes some positive difference. This work critically examines the conciliar documents, some relevant postconciliar documents, and theological reflection of some theologians. And finally, it proffers solutions that will enhance the active participation of the laity in the mission of the church in general and the church in Southeast Nigeria in particular." />
