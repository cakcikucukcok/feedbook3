  <title>Reclaiming the System - Lisa Herzog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world of wage labour seems to have become a soulless machine, an engine of social and environmental destruction. Employees seem to be nothing but &#39;cogs&#39; in this system - but is this true? Located at the intersection of political theory, moral philosophy, and business ethics, this book questions the picture of the world of work as a &#39;system&#39;. Hierarchical organizations, both in the public and in the private sphere, have specific features of their own. This does
not mean, however, that they cannot leave room for moral responsibility, and maybe even human flourishing.
Drawing on detailed empirical case studies, Lisa Herzog analyses the nature of organizations from a normative perspective: their rule-bound character, the ways in which they deal with divided knowledge, and organizational cultures and their relation to morality. The volume examines how individual agency and organizational structures would have to mesh to avoid common moral pitfalls and develops the notion of &#39;transformational agency&#39;, which refers to a critical, creative way of engaging with
one&#39;s organizational role while remaining committed to basic moral norms. The volume goes on to explore the political and institutional changes that would be required to re-embed organizations into a just society. Whether we submit to &#39;the system&#39; or try to reclaim it, Herzog argues, is a question of
eminent political importance in our globalized world." />
