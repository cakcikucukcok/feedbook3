  <title>Great Potential - Steve Moya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Many Americans are wondering (and maybe worrying) about the impact of the growing Latino population. Thats not surprising: in 1970 there were only 9
    million Latinos (4.5% of the nations population) but today theyre fifty million strongand by 2050, that number is projected to grow to ninety-five
    million. So maybe its time to reflect on this important trend, not by isolating Latinos but by considering their role within the larger national context.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Much of the nations attention has centered on immigration or more specifically, illegal immigration. Thats unfortunate because there is a much greater
    story here. The more interesting issues are who is going to pay for Medicare, Social Security and other costs of an aging society, and how as a nation do
    we continually replenish the workforce with people who have the necessary skills to compete in an increasingly competitive world.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    For the United States, part of the answer is its Latino population, the nations youngest and fastest-growing minority, which has shown a strong work ethic
    and the desire to move up the socioeconomic ladder like previous populations. For Latinos, the challenge is this: how to enhance their education levels and
    skills in order to be relevant in the information economy and meet the needs of the modern workplace at a time when federal, state, and local budgets are
    strained, if not declining.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This book explains why an aging America needs Latinos. While it looks in-depth at the economic forces were facing, it focuses on strategies Latino
    families and communities throughout the nation can adopt to build a better future for themselves and the nation.
