  <title>The Case for Impeachment - Dave Lindorff, Barbara Olshansky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The war in &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Iraq&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No bid contracts awarded to Halliburton . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hurricane Katrina . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The CIA leak investigation . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story gets worse and worse. The evidence is glaring. George W. Bush&#39;s record as a president is abysmal. &lt;br&gt;      And it&#39;s time to impeach him. &lt;br&gt;      &lt;i&gt;The Case for Impeachment&lt;/i&gt; lays out the reasons why in a straightforward, letter-of-the-law manner. Mixing the cold, hard facts with the lies and deceptions of this administration, &lt;i&gt;The Case for Impeachment&lt;/i&gt; is a serious consideration of Bush&#39;s high crimes and misdemeanors while in office. This important and timely book will serve as a rallying cry for all those fed up with George W. Bush&#39;s abuses of power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s time for the American people and Congress to act. With so much at stake, we have a president whose administration stands out in its criminality and disdain for the rule of law. The Case for Impeachment explains the legal history and grounds for impeaching George W. Bush and brings forth more than a half dozen articles of impeachment the likes of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Lying and inducing Congress and the American people into an unjust war.&lt;br&gt;*Allowing his friends and business cronies to profiteer off the war in Iraq.&lt;br&gt;*Authorizing torture and rendition of prisoners of war and suspected terrorists--a complete violation of the Geneva Conventions, a treaty the U.S. has signed and is therefore part of our law.&lt;br&gt;*Stripping American citizens of their Constitutional rights--holding people with no charge, wiretapping them illegally, offering them no trial, and never allowing them to face their accusers.&lt;br&gt;*Failing in almost every way possible to defend the homeland and our borders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hard hitting and persuasive in its argument, The Case for Impeachment will be one of the most talked-about political books for the pathetic remainder of the Bush Presidency.&lt;/p&gt;" />
