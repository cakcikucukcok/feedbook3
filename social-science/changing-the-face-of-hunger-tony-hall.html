  <title>Changing the Face of Hunger - Tony Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Struggling to mask his tears, Tony Hall followed a doctor through a mass of dying Ethiopians crying out for food and medicine&amp;mdash;help that could not possibly arrive soon enough or in sufficient quantities to keep them alive. From that painful scene of hopelessness, Hall returned home with a new focus for his faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both as a U.S. Congressman and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Agencies in Rome, he has been a man with a mission. Tony used his passion, faith, and political skills to solicit the aid of those able to help. And as he worked with liberals and conservatives, Republicans and Democrats, and people of very different faiths, he stumbled into a remarkable discovery. He found that people who regularly live at odds often are willing to join forces in helping those who are abjectly poor and hungry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned not only that people can work together across differences . . . but our diversity gives us strength.&quot; Let Tony capture your heart with his dream that we may put aside differences and join hands to feed the hungry, clothe the poor, and discover the importance of life.&lt;/p&gt;
