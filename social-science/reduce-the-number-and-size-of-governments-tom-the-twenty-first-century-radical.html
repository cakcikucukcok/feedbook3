  <title>Reduce the Number and Size of Governments - Tom the Twenty-First-Century Radical</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the moment, governments at all levels have large deficits. A substantial reduction in the administrative cost for government will be required in this century to change this. If the American Dream is to be available to citizens, major changes will be required in education and industry. 
&lt;i&gt;Reduce the Number and Size of Governments,&lt;/i&gt; a new work by Tom, the Twenty-First-Century Radicalauthor of &lt;i&gt;Save Tax Dollars&lt;/i&gt;proposes a collective search for wisdom is required for effective and efficient government. Tom believes it will take a constitutional convention that consists of the best and the brightest, charged with providing an organized government that is efficient and effective, in order to keep the American Dream alive and well-positioned to grow sufficiently and produce new jobs. 
The Communist Soviet Union failed because citizens where not rewarded for work. When there are not opportunities citizens do not work. Without production of saleable products the Soviet Union was bankrupted. The American citizens should learn from this failure and plan for competition in this century. The government of the United States is of the people, by the people, for the people. The people are in charge, and they will have to demand that government meet the challenges of the new century." />
