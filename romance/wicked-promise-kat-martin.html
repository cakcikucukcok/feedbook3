Nicholas Warring, known as the Wicked Early, is a darkly handsome charismatic figure--with the power to save her but a past that could put her reputation dangerously at risk. A ruthless womanizer, he has also been convicted of murder--and barely escaped hanging.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Rogue&#39;s Tainted Honor&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Elizabeth can&#39;t help her attraction to the man who haunts her dreams--nor he his hunger for her. But she knows it can never be. For Nicholas is a married man. Then a heinous crime shatters their lives--and Nick is the natural suspect. Elizabeth wants to believe in his innocence more than life and love itself--but can she trust a man who has killed before?&lt;/p&gt;" />
