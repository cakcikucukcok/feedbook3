  <title>Reasonable Maniacs - Monty Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hearing of his brother&#39;s murder in Belfast, Irish American Wilder O&#39;Neill reacts with such recklessness, his friend Reason McGuinness must risk her life to save him. In an instant their fortunes collide. That night Wilder&#39;s passion unites them; Reason&#39;s fear tears them apart. Bitterly they separate.
Wilder returns to his native Belfast and joins forces with his republican cousin. Reason is hired to renovate the Belfast hospital where Wilder works. He swears his desire for her is gone, that Ireland is his only love, but it&#39;s a lie. He can&#39;t forget Reason. It&#39;s then she meets Cain Cromwell, a disaffected English soldier. Cain has deadly secrets, and a romantic heart Reason can&#39;t resist. She finds herself torn between this mysterious Brit and the passionate Irishman she adores. She follows both men into dangerous worlds.
At first Reason is an unwilling spectator to Ireland&#39;s sectarian conflict, but when she becomes a victim of the war and sees its cruelty, she enlists herself into Wilder&#39;s crusade for Irish freedom. Suddenly she is caught up in a turbulent city where no one is safe, no one is who they appear to be, where violence and passion are a way of life." />
