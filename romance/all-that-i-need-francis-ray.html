  <title>All That I Need - Francis Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;In bestselling author Francis Ray&#39;s latest Grayson Friends novel &lt;/i&gt;All That I Need,&lt;i&gt; two lost souls come together to discover what matters most of all...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOVE COMES WITH NO GUARANTEE &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lance Saxton is a self-made man who enjoys every moment of his success. Running an auction house allows him to manage his own time and travel the world on a moment&#39;s notice--so why rush to settle down? The question answers itself...until he crosses paths with a beautiful, spirited travel writer who makes him second-guess his sense of independence--and leaves him wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; BUT IT&#39;S ALWAYS WORTH THE RISK... &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;What&#39;s love got to do with it? Fallon Marshall is at the peak of her career as a journalist. Any story she wants she can get. So when she hears about an auction being held at a fabled old estate in Santa Fe, New Mexico, off she goes...only to meet a man who makes her question her priorities. Maybe it&#39;s time for Fallon to stop running away in search of adventure...and just fall into Lance&#39;s arms?&lt;/p&gt;" />
