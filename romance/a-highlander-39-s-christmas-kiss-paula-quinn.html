  <title>A Highlander&#39;s Christmas Kiss - Paula Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A STRANGER&#39;S SMILE &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Christmas may be coming to Linavar, but Temperance Menzie is far from joyful. Grief-stricken over the death of her father at the hands of the Black Riders, she almost didn&#39;t see the wounded stranger in the woods. And now she&#39;s determined to give this braw, brooding Highlander the help she couldn&#39;t give her father. But there&#39;s a secret lurking in the depths of his blue-gray eyes. And Temperance won&#39;t rest until she uncovers it . . .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A LOVER&#39;S KISS &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A killer for hire. It&#39;s the last thing Cailean Grant ever thought he&#39;d become, but being part of the Black Riders was his only way to survive. Now, his guilt grows day by day, along with his desire for the beautiful, brave lass nursing him back to health. As Christmas, the season of miracles, draws near and the truth of his identity threatens to come out, Cailean must risk the only thing he has left to lose-his heart." />
