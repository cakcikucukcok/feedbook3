      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A Novel Mystery, Suspense with Sizzling Romance and Humorous Adventures&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; In four short months, James wife came to her demise. He met Maria, and gave her hundreds of thousands of dollars, when he believed in her. He slowly came to the realization that millions were swindled from him. He couldn&amp;#39;t go to the police for help, which left him embroiled in shame.&amp;nbsp; Rage led him to the decision to find Maria and make her pay for what she had done to him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;His journey to find her got him entangled in stranger&amp;rsquo;s love affairs, and business dealings. This led him to the discovery of a well-organized plot that steals billions&amp;rsquo; of dollars. He plotted to recoup the millions stolen from him, and figured out a way to make billions in the process, if everything goes as planned.&lt;/p&gt;" />
