Simon Westfield, the Duke of Blackmoor, is rich, powerful, and sinfully handsome, and has spent his entire life creating scandal and mayhem. It doesn&#39;t help his wolfish temper at all that Miss Lily Rutledge seems not the least bit afraid of him, and in fact, may be as untamable as he is...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A woman whose charm is stronger than the moon...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When Lily&#39;s beloved nephew&#39;s behavior becomes inexplicably wild, she turns to Simon, the boy&#39;s cousin and guardian, for help. But Simon&#39;s idea of assistance is far different than hers, and Lily finds herself ensconced in his house and engaged to the rogue.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;They both may have bitten off more than they can chew when each begins to discover the other&#39;s darkest secrets...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;em&gt;A Certain Wolfish Charm &lt;/em&gt;has bite!
