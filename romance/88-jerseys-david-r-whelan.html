  <title>88 Jerseys - David R. Whelan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A romantic novel intertwined with a sports story that bridges a long lost past with the present.
	A wealthy man named Jarvis Whelan falls in love with his sexy and beautiful secretary, Lois, and wants to relive his past after a trip back to his PA small town roots.
	This fictitious tale was created from a single invitation mailed to his office in LA thus setting the stage for a courtship of sophisticated love with an added drama of high school sports caught in real life issues of adolescent sex, drugs and rock-n-roll.
	Also introduced are the struggles of two underprivileged teenage boys who faced the hardship of economics and hometown politics. But, these two best friends from the other side of the tracks living in government aided project housing prove that hard work makes it possible to tackle all sorts of daily problems. They must also compete against a football system that employs favoritism at the high school level.
	Added in this saga is the element of a close knit relationship between their moms and their peers that mesh together in making a truly remarkable senior year of dope, dates, and delinquent behavior.
	But, a true test of manhood in the form of athletic competition in and off the field combines with their spiritual change and together something special is about to take place, thanks to lucky fate ----- named Jarvis." />
