  <title>Fools Rush In (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani Arabesque) - Gwynne Forster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After a devastating tragedy sent her into a severe depression, Justine Montgomery gave up her newborn daughter for adoption. Realizing her mistake too late, she discovered her daughter had been adopted by divorced journalist Duncan Banks–and that he was looking for a nanny.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Without revealing her identity, Justine took the job. But she never anticipated Duncan&#39;s growing suspicions about her–or the powerful attraction between them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A poverty-ridden childhood and a failed marriage left Duncan Banks unwilling to trust in anyone but himself. It didn&#39;t take him long to realize that there was something not quite right about his daughter&#39;s otherwise perfect nanny. But in trying to uncover Justine&#39;s secrets, Duncan soon found his own vulnerabilities were at stake. With divided loyalties and an unexpected passion threatening their fragile relationship, Justine and Duncan must risk revealing more than they ever imagined to achieve what they never dreamed possible….&lt;/p&gt;
