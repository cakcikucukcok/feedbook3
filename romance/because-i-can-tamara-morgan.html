  <title>Because I Can - Tamara Morgan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John &amp;#34;Monty&amp;#34; Montgomery is a workaholic. The oldest of the Montgomery children, he&amp;#39;s been working by his father&amp;#39;s side building the family hotel chain almost his entire life. His commitment to the business leaves no time for romance. But that&amp;#39;s about to change.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Georgia Lennox has been fantasizing about Monty ever since she started her gig as handywoman at Montgomery Manor. She figures Monty is way out of her league, so she hasn&amp;#39;t dared to act on her feelings&amp;#151;until he offers to help fill a volunteer shortage on her latest project, building houses for families in need.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Sparks fly as they spend time together, first on the job site, then off. But Georgia&amp;#39;s not your typical frilly and feminine society girl. Hoping to find a way to fit in with the Montgomerys, she agrees to be made over by Monty&amp;#39;s sister for an event. But if she lets her rough edges be smoothed away, will she be letting go of the very thing that attracted Monty in the first place?&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Read about the other Montgomerys in &lt;em&gt;If I Stay&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;When I Fall&lt;/em&gt;, available now.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;102,000 words" />
