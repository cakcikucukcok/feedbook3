  <title>Of Deadly Intent - Pamela M. Parry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carolyn Hewlett is thrilled to receive an offer to work at the illustrious Craigshore House in British Columbia, Canada. She has the opportunity to observe firsthand the brilliant playwright Allan Wyndham, and Carolyn cant pass up the opportunity to learn all she can. There are oddities at Craigshore, however; she wonders over the significance of a secluded rose garden, and Wyndhams nephew is anything but normal.
Even so, Carolyn writes off these observations as mere flights of fancy. She always had an active imagination, and Wyndhams work invokes certain dark, mysterious images in her mind. Theres nothing to be worried about at Craigshore House  until a friend disappears. Carolyns suspicions begin to seem more rational. Could it be that her initial observations were actuallyand dreadfullytrue? 
Carolyn doesnt have much time. She must solve the mystery of her missing friend. Not only does she have to stop an abductor, but she has to seriously consider leaving her job. How can she do it without raising suspicions? It all comes back to Wyndham and his nephewif they suspect her, life as she knows it will end, and Carolyn might become another missing person at Craigshore." />
