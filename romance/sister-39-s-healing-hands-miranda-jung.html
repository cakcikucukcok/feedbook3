  <title>Sister&#39;s Healing Hands - Miranda Jung</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sofie spends her time daydreaming about handsome young men around her, and it&amp;#39;s all thanks to Ethan. At the cusp of manhood, he&amp;#39;s everything a robust, healthy gentleman ought to be. Until she comes home to find him sick and in need of some delicate medical care. Just as well Sofie is a trained nurse and happy to help him on the road to recovery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sofie couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait to get home from her shift at the hospital. The afternoons were always a unique kind of torture for her. Not that her job was so tedious. She enjoyed her work as a nurse and knew that the long years of study and training were worth it. Whenever she zipped up her green gown and pinned on her nametag, she felt a sense of accomplishment, ready to tend to any malady that came her way like a modern Florance Nightingale.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The problem for Sofie was the trip home on the train, which was always tightly packed with students filing out of schools and colleges at the end of the day. The small cars became utterly cramped with hot, writhing bodies, chatting away about whatever lessons they had and what plans they were making when they got home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The true torture for her was the boys, though. She knew she made an impression in her dark stockings and tight uniform. Just as she knew that it hugged her hourglass figure well, accentuating her bust and clinging to her hips. And every tremor and rumble the train made over the tracks left her with an ample sway and shift that let the world around her know how soft and supple she was underneath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And Sofie loved it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She knew she only had to stand there and patiently wait for her stop, the picture of purity, of professional medicine, and nearly every boy in their late teens was discreetly checking her out. She could see and feel eyes roaming on her as soon as they piled in. Whenever she shifted her weight from one leg to the next, allowing her hip to stretch the fabric of her clothes and reveal an extra inch of her thigh, she wanted to smirk at how many of then shifted uncomfortably.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She wondered how many would lock their bedroom door when they got home and touched themselves while thinking of the pretty nurse on the ride back. She bit her lip and looked out the window, trying not to grin at her private fantasies of having so many beautiful cocks being stroked for her." />
