  <title>The Cruel Shadow of Love - C.V. Naveen Reddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everyone experiences emotions that remain as strong memories throughout the life, the strongest one being first love. The funny part is, it occurs at the most unexpected of times. Edy Ravenden, a student of Morey&#39;s Public School was too oblivious to the events that was to occur in the course of one year&#39;s time, the most important year of his academic careergrade 10. A new stern principal, a pretty newcomer, a best friend with psychological skills obtained from his expert dad, and a new joiner to the First Benchers group who happens to be a excellent situation analyzer all turn out to be the catalysts to Edy&#39;s first love.
Luck finally brings two first-time lovers together. But unfortunately, the love of the girl is revealed through her confiscated personal diary at a time that can be described as very undesirable, as the envy of a jealous classmate leads to the disaster. Edy holds on to his rail-thin hopes to make things right for his lady love. But fate is never constant, and change is ever as inevitable as change itself. The universal truth is that everything goes from an orderly state to a disorderly state." />
