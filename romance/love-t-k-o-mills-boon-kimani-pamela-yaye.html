  <title>Love T.K.O. (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) - Pamela Yaye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Stunning Yasmin Ohaji is every man&#39;s fantasy, but the popular marriage counselor is too busy to bother with romance. Still, Rashawn Bishop isn&#39;t giving up. The pro boxer is wooing her with finesse and fancy footwork, and his powerful build makes her weak in all the right places. He&#39;s definitely not her type, but she&#39;s deliciously tempted….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rashawn can&#39;t sleep, can&#39;t train and can&#39;t concentrate–all because of Yasmin. When he&#39;s not coming up with ways to show her they&#39;re not so different, he&#39;s dreaming of possessing every inch of her luscious curves. And when Yasmin finally surrenders, she becomes his everything. But love means making choices. Now, with his career on the line, will he follow the lure of boxing…or the woman he can&#39;t live without?&lt;/p&gt;
