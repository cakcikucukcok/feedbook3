          &lt;strong&gt;COULD SHE GO HOME AGAIN?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Paula Hansen had her doubts about returning to Bedford Creek and Alex Caine–the man she&#39;d once loved–but she knew she couldn&#39;t deny her aunt&#39;s request. So she&#39;d turned to God for guidance, and heard His answer loud and clear. She needed to put memories of their past aside and help bring this proudly independent father and his troubled son closer together….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Burdened with saving his family&#39;s company, Alex soon discovered Paula was the answer to his prayers. And now that he&#39;d been blessed with a second chance, he&#39;d do anything to make sure that this time, Paula would be in his life forever!&lt;/p&gt;
