        &lt;p&gt;Glory Little thought she’d never see Rafaello Grazzini ever again, but her brother’s foolish behaviour has thrown her straight back into the lion’s den. To avoid her brother’s imprisonment and to save her father’s job, she must submit to his demands and become the ruthless Greek’s mistress.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;To wife!&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rafaello knows that Glory won’t be able to resist his practiced and persuasive seduction. But when he discovers her innocence, he is forced to admit that he was wrong about Glory. With the possibility that she might be pregnant, there is only one solution; his mistress must become his wife!&lt;/p&gt;
