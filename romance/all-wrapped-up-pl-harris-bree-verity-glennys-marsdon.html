  <title>All Wrapped Up - Pl Harris, Bree Verity, Glennys Marsdon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Whittaker Springs, Christmas is a magical time&amp;mdash;and love is in the air. From new beginnings to rekindling old flames, this present is &lt;em&gt;All Wrapped Up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Christmas Fever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by P.L. Harris&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After failing to make it big in London, Tessa returns to small-town life to care for her ailing mother. If only she could avoid Blake, the one who got away. It&amp;rsquo;s been six long years of failed romances and missed Christmases, but Tessa and Blake can&amp;rsquo;t deny the attraction between them. The past weaves into the present as hurt, betrayal, and lust sears through their minds and bodies. Will the secrets and lies that kept them apart triumph, or will they finally get the antidote for this &lt;em&gt;Christmas Fever&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;There Must be Tinsel&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Bree Verity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The holidays are supposed to be fun, but Hallie has spent the last four years of her life trying to be a picture-perfect girlfriend. Repressing who she is in a miserable relationship isn&amp;rsquo;t making her happy, but that is all about to change. Hallie&amp;rsquo;s happiness comes in the form of her best friend, Jacob, who has been her partner through thick and thin. When her world is turned upside down, Hallie needs strong arms to keep her level&amp;hellip;and Jacob has always been there for her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exposed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Glennys Marsdon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To the outward world, Connie Mulburn is as safe and dull as a woman can be. She&amp;rsquo;s a simple children&amp;rsquo;s author and that&amp;rsquo;s how she likes it. That all changes when Justin, the playful prankster from her past, comes back as a sexy businessman, bent on pulling her out of her shell. Cautious Connie has a secret life&amp;mdash;a pseudonym that everyone is talking about. When her racy secret is in jeopardy, Justin pushes her with one steamy challenge. &amp;ldquo;I dare you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Merry Christmas Liebchen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; by Caenys Kerr&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jolene does everything she can to take care of her elderly aunt. When that same aunt lands in the hospital and falls behind on her bills, Jolene finds herself between a rock and hard place. Selling her beloved car, with the help of the irresistible and exotic mechanic, Karl, seems to be her only chance to keep the family home. But there&amp;rsquo;s more to the gorgeous Karl than meets the eye. He has a past that could make or break their new-found relationship and Jolene will have to decide if her German sweetheart is worth the risk.&lt;/p&gt;" />
