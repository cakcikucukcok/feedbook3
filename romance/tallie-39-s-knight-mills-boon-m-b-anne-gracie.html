  <title>Tallie&#39;s Knight (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Anne Gracie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;MAGNUS HAD DECIDED TO SELECT A BRIDE!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Miss Thalia Robinson, a destitute orphan, was fortunate that she had been allowed to look after her cousin Laetitia&#39;s three adorable children. Tallie usually spent her quiet life lost in daydreams, but the arrival of a house party to aid Magnus, Earl of d&#39;Arenville, to find a wife, turned her world upside down.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Magnus&#39;s cold facade had been pierced by a delightful small girl, and now he&#39;d decided he wanted children of his own. For that, he needed a wife. But things didn&#39;t go according to Laetitia&#39;s plan, for he ignored all the debutantes that were presented to him, and, taken with Tallie&#39;s loving treatment of the children in her charge, decided that &lt;em&gt;she&lt;/em&gt; was the one he would marry….&lt;/p&gt;
