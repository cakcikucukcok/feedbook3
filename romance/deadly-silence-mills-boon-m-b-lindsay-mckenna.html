  <title>Deadly Silence (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Lindsay McKenna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Lieutenant Matt Sinclaire has always loved fighting fires–until the fateful day when the flames came for his family. Arson took his wife and has left him alone with an eight-year-old daughter too traumatized to speak–and the ruins of his life are proving difficult to rebuild.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When U.S. Forest Ranger Casey Cantrell is assigned to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, the last thing she expects to find is a wounded firefighter and his damaged daughter. But after a chance encounter in the woods, she finds herself becoming almost a mother to the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, two years after the fire, Matt feels on the verge of finally getting his little girl back, and even of finding love again. But can he protect them from the evil that stripped him of his life once before?&lt;/p&gt;
