  <title>Between Dog and Wolf - Elske Rahill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You need a little hypocrisy in you,&#39; he told me more than once. You need to be a little tainted if you are not to be corrupted altogether.&#39; The French call it entre chien et loup . . . Darkly moving, often shocking, this interwoven story follows three college students, desperately searching for a place between the familiar and the strange as they careen towards self- knowledge. Cassandra, volatile and scarred by loss, has been sculpted by the bohemian high life and then discarded. Oisín, a country boy pulsing with sexual aggression, is prone to equal flights of rage and compassion. And you, Helen. Helen, who takes these two fractured lives and dashes them against herself, creating ripples that twist and distort their images of what should be. In this stunning debut novel, each character forces the boundaries of normality, negotiating the chasms of their own violent sexuality and decay. A dark, insightful and utterly compelling book. Beautifully written.&#39; Donal Ryan" />
