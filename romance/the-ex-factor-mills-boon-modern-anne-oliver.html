  <title>The Ex Factor (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Anne Oliver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Melanie Sawyer&#39;s intense affair with Luke Delaney was fuelled by an all-consuming desire. Both knew it couldn&#39;t last–she was a waitress, he was the son of a millionaire. Feeling out of her depth, Mel ended it–but was left with an enduring reminder of Luke….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Mel meets her ex again, he still has the X factor, and the red-hot passion between them reignites. As they spend time getting to know each other again–intimately–they realize the chemistry between them is too powerful to resist. But once Mel&#39;s secret comes out, will Luke be able to trust her?&lt;/p&gt;
