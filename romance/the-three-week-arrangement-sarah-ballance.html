  <title>The Three-Week Arrangement - Sarah Ballance</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ethan Chase isn&#39;t interested in dating. After losing the woman he loved more than life itself, he&#39;d much rather ride solo, but his family is dead set on fixing him up. To get them off his back, he hooks up with ultra-adventurous, ultra-&lt;i&gt;temporary&lt;/i&gt; adventure photographer, Rue Campbell. All he has to do is survive three weeks in her orbit and he&#39;ll be single again, only without the pitying looks and pressure to move on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rue is literally counting the days until her plane leaves New York City. The last thing she wants is a relationship, but being Ethan&#39;s pretend girlfriend can&#39;t hurt, right? Wrong. With Ethan, there&#39;s no faking &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;--in or out of the bedroom. With the sheets burning hot and the clock ticking on their arrangement, Rue realizes she&#39;s falling for a man guaranteed to derail her goals...and break her heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Chase Brothers series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order.&lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Five Things I Love About You&lt;br&gt;Book #2 For Seven Nights Only&lt;br&gt;Book #3 The Three Week Arrangement&lt;br&gt;Book #4 The 48 Hour Hook Up&lt;br&gt;Book #5 One Sexy Mistake&lt;/p&gt;" />
