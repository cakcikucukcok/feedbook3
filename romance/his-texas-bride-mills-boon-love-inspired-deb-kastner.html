  <title>His Texas Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) - Deb Kastner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been years since single father Buck Redmond set foot in his Texas hometown. For good reasons–or so he thinks. He plans to quickly sell his family&#39;s ranch and hightail it out with his son. But the Redmond homestead now belongs to his former flame, Ellie McBride.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The violet-eyed beauty stirs up all kinds of bittersweet memories–including why Buck left her behind. And she somehow manages to turn his scowling son into a happy, talkative junior cowboy. Soon enough, Buck is reminded of why he loved Ellie. But making her his Texas bride will mean &lt;em&gt;completely &lt;/em&gt;opening his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
