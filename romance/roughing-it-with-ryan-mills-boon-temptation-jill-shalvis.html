  <title>Roughing It with Ryan (Mills &amp; Boon Temptation) - Jill Shalvis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Suzanne Carter has sworn off men…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;really! Her inability to take life seriously drives them crazy, so it&#39;s best she leaves them alone. Then one night, strong, handsome Ryan Alondo rescues her and she simply melts. Who could resist all that rough-and-tumble sexiness? But as tempting as he is, she&#39;s not going to fall for his charms. Because there&#39;s no way she wants to ruin a man this gorgeous.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From the moment Ryan sets eyes on Suzanne, he knows she&#39;s the one for him. She&#39;s fun and sexy and exactly what he needs in his overcrowded, responsible life. And the passion between them can&#39;t be ignored. He just has to convince her he&#39;s serious enough for both of them. Good thing he can be very, very persuasive….&lt;/p&gt;
