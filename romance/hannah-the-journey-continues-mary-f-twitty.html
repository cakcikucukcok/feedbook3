  <title>Hannah, the Journey Continues - Mary F. Twitty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Arriving in the United States in 1840, Hannah Hannigan dreams of making a better life for her and her family. In Hannah, The Journey Continues, she and her husband Seamus are faced with a series of tragedies. Yet, it is through perseverance and dogged determination Hannah rises above adversity, to fulfill her dreams.
 	Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to celebrate, Bishop Doheny looked out at the audience, then slowly continued, with thanksgiving to God for the gift of life.
	Thanksgiving? How can that be? What gift of life? . . . they are dead. She held her rosary.
	Mary F. Twitty was born in Chicago and attended DePaul University. She is a mother and grandmother. After retiring from the U.S. House of Representatives as a Special Assistant to two different Members of Congress, she now resides in South Florida. This is her fifth novel. The others are: Hannahs Journey; Selective Discretion; Ashley Visits Urchin Village; and, I, Jude.
	Hannah, The Journey Continues, is an odyssey about Hannah Hannigan and her Irish family immigrating to America in 1840. Hannah, a strong-willed, determined woman, and her husband Seamus, the gentle rock of the family, settles in Boston and become outstanding citizens and pillars of the community.
	Cholera strikes and more than 500 immigrants die, but through sheer tenacity Hannah obtains 160 acres for 80 families who survived. In every instance of conflict, she overcomes, but two she cannot, until a new life arrives.
I will read it again for the pleasure of being a part of this family.
Margaret Mary Cuthrell
Poet and Memoirist
	In the great tradition of family sagas, Hannah, The Journey Continues, tells of the struggle of generations of immigrants to make a better life in the new world. Hannah Hannigan, the stern matriarch of her family, carries a secret from her past she believes can destroy her and her family. Yet, Hannah builds on tragedy and adversity, to make a new life, and never leaves the rich traditions of her roots far behind.
	Mary F. Twitty has given us the perfect poetic blend of the old and the new, the values of a treasured past she skillfully weaves into the new life of Hannah and Seamus in the United States.
