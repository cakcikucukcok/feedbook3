  <title>Torrid Exposure - Book 3 - Carla Coxwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Book 3&amp;nbsp;of the Torrid Exposure New Adult Romance Series&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Billionaire New Adult Romance Story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
April has discovered her sister&amp;#39;s darkest secret that has kept their relationship on the rocks since her near-fatal car accident.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
April feels disconnected. After learning of her father&amp;rsquo;s death, she suddenly feels as if she has lost her one ally in her family. All she has left is her promise to her father that she will make things right with her sister, Spencer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Spencer&amp;rsquo;s secrets are dark and heavily protected. As April refuses to give up and dives head first into discovering the past, she also falls deeper in with Bennett, the billionaire heir to a far reaching media corporation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As April risks her heart on Bennett and decides to allow herself to grow closer to him, she tries to maintain her blossoming freelance photographer career as well as juggle her grief over her father&amp;rsquo;s death and her relationship with her sister. On top of that, her best friend, Emily, has a penchant for making rash decisions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
April falls down the rabbit hole, discovering more of Spencer&amp;rsquo;s past. But once she discovers what happened that night of her car accident, will April be able to accept it? What will it mean for her relationship with Bennett?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
