  <title>Madrina a We Are the Devil&#39;s Daughters Story - Mara Reitsma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="She was one of three, sired by the Lord of Darkness and born to the Lady of Light. The eldest of the sisters, Madrina was more like her Mother, than the rest. She was quick and cunning, and beyond all else, her dedication to the rules, made her the perfect Warden of The Null. She had worked hard to maintain order in her Father&#39;s deepest, darkest prison in what was known as The Void.      But times had grown tough for the Warden, and what had once been a walk in the park job, had landed her in more trouble than she had asked for. Bound in the clutches of the enemy, her heart and her mind, buried in layers of secrets and lies, Madrina must fight back against the fears that keep her far from the ones she loves; the very fears, that tighten the enemy&#39;s hold on her.      Can she escape, not only the cell they imprisoned her in, but the nightmares and visions that follow? Will she ever give in, and let herself love, the Angel?" />
