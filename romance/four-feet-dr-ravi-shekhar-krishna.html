  <title>Four Feet - Dr. Ravi Shekhar Krishna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every college has a specific set of students. There is always a guy who licks his HODs ass for every small little thing. There is always a girl who sleeps around with everyone and talks about it as an achievement. There is always a nerd who never thinks that love was a part of students life. There is always an innocent girl who falls in love and is willing to die for it. There is always a playboy who manages everything perfectly well till he falls in love. There is always a heartbroken girl that has stopped believing in love and thinks that every guy is a jerk. There is always a professor who is pathetic at his language but doesnt stop talking. There is always a professor who is extremely hot and sexy but has two children already. There is always a stupid guy who keeps bugging his ex-girlfriend for the smallest of reasons.
This isnt about the professors or the asslicker. This isnt even about the slut or the stupid ex-boyfriend. This story is about the nerd, the innocent girl, the playboy, and the heartbroken girl and their lives, which revolve around one another. This story is about their emotions, which makes them do things they had never foreseen. This story is about love!" />
