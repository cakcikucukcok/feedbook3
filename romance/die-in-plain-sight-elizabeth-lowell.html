  <title>Die in Plain Sight - Elizabeth Lowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell creates another masterpiece of excitement and chills, passion and surprise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Die in Plain Sight&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lacey Quinn inherits the striking landscapes done by her late, much-loved grandfather, she believes they are as good as anything hanging in museums. But the paintings now in her possession are more than the works of a talented master. They are anguished voices from the grave . . . crying murder!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacey begins researching her grandfather&#39;s past -- and is rocked almost immediately by a strange series of violent events. Someone wants to steal her inheritance, to reduce the paintings to unrecognizable ashes in a suspicious blaze. Someone wants to prevent Lacey from examining her grandfather&#39;s work too closely . . . by any means necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ian Lapstrake, a security specialist, has taken an interest in Lacey&#39;s inheritance . . . and in her. Troubled by what he sees, he becomes Lacey&#39;s shadow, as her search for answers leads them both down an ever-darkening road paved with lies, blood, and devastating secrets.&lt;/p&gt;" />
