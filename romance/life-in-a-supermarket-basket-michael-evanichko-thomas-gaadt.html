  <title>Life in a Supermarket Basket - Michael Evanichko, Thomas Gaadt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hurrying out of the supermarket with a typical shopping bag of items, Vincent is mown down by a passing car. Symbolised by the items in his shopping basket, each embarrassing episode in his downtrodden life passes before his eyes as he struggles to survive. A life-changing near-death experience related with compelling satirical humor, guaranteed to make you smile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vincent fidgeted as he waited in the ten-items-or-less lane, for he clearly had more than ten items in his dainty, little basket.&amp;nbsp; As the line of impatient shoppers grew he was sure he&amp;rsquo;d be publicly humiliated for the sin of supermarket disobedience.&amp;nbsp; The practice of stoning would resurface, only frozen Cornish-hens would be launched at his large frame instead of stones.&amp;nbsp; If only he knew within a few minutes he&amp;rsquo;d be visiting the afterlife after being hit by a car, he would&amp;rsquo;ve checked his minor anxiety attack at the customer service counter.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;As Vincent&amp;rsquo;s spirit rose above the mayhem, so too, did each of his purchased items, as each of them triggered a remarkable and occasionally embarrassing memory of his past.&amp;nbsp; He was forced to examine his current state of unhappiness as he awaited answers to the lingering questions:&amp;nbsp; Would his life end in the parking lot of his favorite grocer?&amp;nbsp; Would he be accurate in the belief that heaven was non-existent?&lt;/p&gt;" />
