  <title>Last Night with the Duke - Amelia Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Could finding love be his greatest scandal of all? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Duke of Griffin has never lived down his reputation as one of the Rakes of St. James. Now rumors are swirling around London that his twin sisters may bear the brunt of his past follies. Hiring a competent chaperone is the only thing Griffin has on his mind--until he meets the lovely and intriguing Miss Esmeralda Swift. In ways he could never have expected, she arouses more than just his curiosity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esmeralda Swift considered herself too sensible to ever fall for a scoundrel, but that was before she met the irresistibly seductive Duke of Griffin. His employment offer proves too tempting for her to resist. She can&#39;t afford to be distracted by his devilish charms because the stakes are so high for his sisters&#39; debut Season. . .unless one of London&#39;s most notorious rakes has had a change of heart and is ready to make Esmeralda his bride in &lt;i&gt;Last Night with the Duke, &lt;/i&gt;the first novel in the brand-new Regency &lt;i&gt;Rakes of St. James &lt;/i&gt;series by &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Amelia Grey.&lt;/p&gt;" />
