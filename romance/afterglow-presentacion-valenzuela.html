      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;She was kissed by love&lt;br&gt;
She was kissed with love&lt;br&gt;
She kissed to love devotedly . . .eternally&lt;br&gt;.
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Young Blancquita was born in an abbey and was raised by nuns until she was sixteen years old. At her coming of age, she was ordered to leave the sanctuary to find for herself her real vocation in life. She was entrusted by the new Mother Superior of the abbey to a legendary wealthy family who were principal benefactor of the abbey.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There, she was thrust into a world of riches testing her faith and morality. Though she lived a life of luxury with this family, she never forgot who she was and what was foremost in her heart and mind: to return to the abbey on her eighteenth birthday to become a nun and to find out about her parents and what really happened to them. Her road back to the abbey was blocked by heartbreaking events that happened in her young life. In the end, she learned about her parentage and was proud to discover that she was the offspring of young true love between two fine people whose young lives were both claimed untimely by death.&lt;/br&gt;" />
