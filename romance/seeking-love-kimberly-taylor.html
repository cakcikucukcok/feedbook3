  <title>Seeking Love - Kimberly Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alyssa MacHandmon is sitting at her desk when her life is changed forever. She receives not only an assignment, but a life she only read about in her books. For a woman like Alyssa, meeting Drake was not only scary and nerve wrecking, it was also captivating in ways she didnt understand. When she fell in the arms of a man on the elevator, little did she know she was falling into the hands that held the key to her happiness. After Alyssa gets over Drakes past with the help of her best friend Gabby, and her boss Jessy pushes her into a by chance meeting. Alyssa learns how to find her way through life and love again.
Standing on an elevator thinking of his children, Drake had no clue that the next time the doors opened his life would spin so out of control. He held his breath when the prettiest woman he ever laid eyes on step on with him. When she got pushed and he caught her, he knew he had caught a gift. Not being able to stop thinking of her made work hard and his interest in dating go down. He could still smell her scent long after he closed the car door and pulled from the curb. With the help of his cousin Chase and the help from his mother, he realized he could not ignore these feelings he had and that he would stop at nothing to have her." />
