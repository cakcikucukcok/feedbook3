  <title>Catywampus - Dan Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Catywampus: is a continuation of the story begun in Admirals Son Generals Daughter and is a parallel to Jigsaw.  This book describes in vivid detail what may have occurred in the United States Military between 1896 and 1906 during the McKinley and Roosevelt  Presidential administrations.  The narration is by the grandson of a career naval officer, born in Beaufort, South Carolina.  He will serve as a cadet in Annapolis and as a member of the elite submarine commanders in the United States Navy.  The historical events of 1896 through 1906 are carefully followed.  The imagination of the author provides rich characters in powerful settings from the torpedo proving grounds in Newport, Rhode Island to the jungles of Central America when he joins his brother on a navy manhunt of killers. The love story between a man and a woman is woven throughout the book when the grandson graduates from the naval academy and marries his childhood sweetheart.  He is unaware that his father and his Uncle Theodore Roosevelt have decided to tap his knowledge of modern submarines and his photographic memory to become one of this countries most successful counter intelligence officers.
	Scenes are set carefully with attention to accurate research of the low country of South Carolina as well as our Nation&#39;s Capital circa 1896 -1906.  The second edition of Peoples Standard History of the United States written by Edward S. Ellis and published in 1906 by Western Book Syndicate and copyrighted by the Woolfall Company have provided background materials, maps of the period and needed information on how the federal government was organized and functioned during this period of history" />
