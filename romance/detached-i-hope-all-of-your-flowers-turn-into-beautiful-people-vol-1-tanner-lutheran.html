  <title>Detached: I Hope All of Your Flowers Turn Into Beautiful People: Vol.1 - Tanner Lutheran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this vivid, ever-changing literary fiction, characters come to life as Zachary Byrd runs from a tragic accident and aimlessly sets off across the country. Not long after hitting the road, he gets lost but quickly finds himself in the middle of someone else&#39;s tribulations. To Zachary, his journey is an eye for an eye-to save one life and make up for one life and make up for another he may have stolen. He obsesses over tipping the scales until he risks his life to rescue Astrid Mavis from hers. From the trenches of train yards to bus stations, they never stay in one place too long, learning from the rich bonds with others along the way until they finally name a destination as far away from home as they can go.   When the smoke clears, all that&#39;s left is a note- A note that will change everything.  &quot;Both self aware and sweetly transgressive. It brings new life to the road-trip romance. An artistic, vivid debut novel.&quot; -Foreword Clarion Reviews  Watch videos and read more reviews at TannerLutheran.com" />
