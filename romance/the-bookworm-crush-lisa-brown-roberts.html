  <title>The Bookworm Crush - Lisa Brown Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This spinoff of &lt;/i&gt;The Replacement Crush&lt;i&gt; featuring Amy and Toff is sure to melt your heart.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shy bookworm Amy McIntyre is about to compete for the chance to interview her favorite author, who hasn&#39;t spoken to the press in years. The only way to win is to step out of the shadows and into the spotlight, but that level of confidence has never come easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution? A competition coach. The problem? The best person for the job is the guy she&#39;s secretly crushing on...local surfer celebrity Toff Nichols.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s a player. He&#39;s a heartthrob. He makes her forget basic things, like how to breathe. How can she feel any confidence around &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To her surprise, Toff agrees to help. And he&#39;s an excellent teacher. Amy feels braver--maybe even brave enough to admit her feelings for him. When their late night practices become less about coaching and more about making out, Amy&#39;s newfound confidence wavers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But does Toff really like her or is this just another lesson?&lt;/p&gt;" />
