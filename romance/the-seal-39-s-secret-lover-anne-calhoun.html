  <title>The SEAL&#39;s Secret Lover - Anne Calhoun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The first in the Alpha Ops novella series that features an alpha Navy SEAL who meets his match in a buttoned-up firecracker who is hiding a passionate side.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;Logistics director Rose Powell agreed to chaperone her grandmother on a guided tour of Roman ruins on one condition: her brother Jack would come with her. But when Jack backs out, his best friend and fellow SEAL Keenan Parker takes his place. Without a working cell phone, Rose&#39;s orderly world drifts into dreamy days and hot, secret nights in Keenan&#39;s bed. Keenan left the Navy but never made it any farther than Istanbul, much less to a viable future. Until he does, he&#39;ll show Rose things she didn&#39;t know about herself. Can he give his heart and his future to the woman he promised his best friend he&#39;d never touch?&lt;/p&gt;" />
