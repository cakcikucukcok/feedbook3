          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Three passionate love stories from bestselling author Maureen Child &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Scorned by the Boss &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shipping tycoon Jefferson wasn’t a man who took no for an answer. So when his ‘faithful’ secretary quit, he followed her to her holiday resort. But there’d be no relaxing for Jefferson…he was out to seduce Caitlyn. But she was more desirable than Jefferson had ever realised.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Seduced by the Rich Man &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Max’s need for a temporary wife and his desire for Janine seemed to coincide perfectly. He knew that Janine wasn’t in a position to refuse his offer – or his bed. But then their make-believe marriage became more passionate than either anticipated…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt; Captured by the Billionaire&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gabriel had nearly forgotten the past…until Debbie arrived at his resort. She’d walked away from him once, but now he wasn’t letting her leave his island without exacting his own brand of revenge – the ultimate seduction.&lt;/p&gt;
