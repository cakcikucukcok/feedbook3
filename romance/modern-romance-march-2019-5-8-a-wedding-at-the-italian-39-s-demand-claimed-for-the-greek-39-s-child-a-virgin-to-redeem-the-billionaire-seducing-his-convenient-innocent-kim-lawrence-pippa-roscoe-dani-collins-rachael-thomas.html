        &lt;h2&gt;The latest red-hot romances from Mills &amp; Boon Modern!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wedding at the Italian’s Demand&lt;/em&gt; by Kim Lawrence&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ivo Greco is determined to claim his orphaned nephew—the infant who will inherit the Greco fortune. To do so he needs to convince the baby’s legal guardian, fiery Flora Henderson, to wear his ring. But whisking Flora to Tuscany as his fake fiancée comes with a complication…their undeniable chemistry! A permanent marriage was never on the cards for cool-headed Ivo—until now!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claimed for the Greek’s Child&lt;/em&gt; by Pippa Roscoe&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Finding himself at Anna Moore’s door having tracked down the mysterious beauty is the least shocking part of Dimitri Kyriakou’s day. Because discovering the consequence of their one spectacular night has floored him! To secure his child, ruthless Dimitri must make Anna his wife. But the only thing harder than convincing Anna to be his convenient bride is trying to ignore their red-hot attraction…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Virgin to Redeem the Billionaire&lt;/em&gt; by Dani Collins&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Self-made billionaire Kaine Michaels has just given Gisella Drummond, daughter of one of New York’s most influential dynasties, a shocking ultimatum: use her spotless reputation to save his own or he’ll ruin her family for betraying him! Kaine knows Gisella wants him, and he knows how much pleasure he can give her! But uncovering sweet Gisella’s virginity makes Kaine want her for so much more than revenge…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seducing His Convenient Innocent &lt;/em&gt;by Rachael Thomas&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Lysandros Drakakis always gets what he wants—and he’s never stopped wanting beautiful pianist Rio Armstrong! A fake engagement to please his family is the perfect opportunity to uncover the reason why she walked away from their powerful connection…and to indulge their still-sizzling desire under the Mediterranean sun. But Rio’s heartbreaking revelation changes the stakes—he’s given her his ring…now Lysandros finds himself wanting to give Rio everything…&lt;/p&gt;
