  <title>Luck of the Draw - Kelley Vitollo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rowan McKinley isn&#39;t looking for one wild night while vacationing in Vegas, but she gets it anyway when she meets professional poker player-and professional ladies&#39; man-Breck Wilder. Breck&#39;s easygoing charm and lighthearted banter draw in the reserved Rowan, and though she&#39;s always dreamed of the kind of forever love her best friends Sidney and Kade share, she&#39;ll settle for one night with the charismatic player. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After their crazy one-night stand, Breck never expected to see the mysterious redhead again. So when he shows up at a Shamrock Falls B&amp;B looking to get away for a few weeks and Rowan answers the door, he&#39;s floored. Breck&#39;s rolling-stone lifestyle and ill-fated history with women means he&#39;s not interested in anything long-term. But the longer he stays at the B&amp;B, the more he considers dropping the poker face and putting all his cards on the table...for Rowan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Shamrock Falls series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Lucky Break&lt;br&gt;* Luck of the Draw&lt;br&gt;* Just My Luck&lt;/p&gt;" />

Luck Of The Draw is the second book in her Shamrock Falls series. You can find my review of the first book, Lucky Break. I had really enjoyed Lucky Break and I'd really enjoyed reading about all the characters in Shamrock Falls then so it was great to comeback to them and read Rowan's story.<br /><b><i>Luck of the Draw (Shamrock Falls, #2) by Kelley Vitollo</i></b> | I'm a fan of Nyrae Dawn (Charade), and when I found out she also wrote under Kelley Vitollo I picked up Lucky Break. I really liked the pacing and plot of Lucky Break and found out a week before the release date of Luck Of The Draw that she had written a sequel.<br /><b><i>Luck of the Draw: A Shamrock Falls Novel - Kindle edition ...</i></b> | The NOOK Book (eBook) of the Luck of the Draw: A Shamrock Falls Novel by Kelley Vitollo at Barnes &amp; Noble.
