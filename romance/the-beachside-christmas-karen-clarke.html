  <title>The Beachside Christmas - Karen Clarke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Snow is falling and there&amp;#x2019;s romance in the air. Curl up for a cosy Christmas by the fire at Seaview Cottage&amp;#x2026;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When thirty-year-old &lt;b&gt;Lily Ambrose&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2019;s latest relationship ends in disaster, she remembers happy childhood holidays in the seaside town of Shipley and decides it&amp;#x2019;s the perfect place for a fresh start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when Lily arrives, the town&amp;#x2019;s spirits are as low as her own: the local celebrity due to turn on the Christmas lights has gone on a cruise instead. Keen to prove herself, she calls in a favour and secures gorgeous reality star &lt;b&gt;Ollie&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lily&amp;#x2019;s neighbours are initially thrilled, but Ollie is as uncontrollable as he is good-looking. He can&amp;#x2019;t remember the town&amp;#x2019;s name, calls the Christmas decorations tacky, and manages to offend &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;. And whilst handsome but stubborn cameraman &lt;b&gt;Craig&lt;/b&gt; tries to help, even he can&amp;#x2019;t stop Ollie&amp;#x2019;s madcap plans to stage a romance with Lily&amp;#x2026;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will Lily be able to keep Ollie under control and bring the Christmas cheer back to Shipley &amp;#x2013;&amp;#xa0;and find herself a &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; kiss under the mistletoe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An addictive, heart-warming and uplifting read about friendship, romance, and Christmas spirit.
