  <title>Arousal: The Lifestyle Trilogy - RM Conté</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Arousal&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; by RM Cont&amp;eacute;&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt; the first book in The Lifestyle Trilogy&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Richard and Beth Anderson, upper, middle-class parents in their late thirties, warily accept a friend&amp;#39;s invitation to visit a swingers&amp;#39; club. Several visits later, they realize they enjoy the lifestyle and become members of Club Climax. The Club provides them a venue for the hottest sex of their lives with each other, with their friends and with strangers. Unfortunately, what goes on at the Club is not all good, clean fun as Richard discovers. Becoming friends with an unsavory couple and the poor choices that result, brings turmoil to many aspects of his life including his marriage, work as an architect and his very existence.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beth has issues of her own. Mutual, smoldering, sexual tension between her and wealthy club member, Tom, results in lustful, yet sensual love-making that delights the Club&amp;#39;s voyeurs. Their private, penthouse, sexual explosions break the swinger code of conduct and cause Beth to become deceitful to those around her.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once happily married and devoted parents, the Andersons become caught up in the lifestyle which serves to unbalance their priorities and destroy the serene, predictable life they once enjoyed. Can they get &amp;#39;happily ever after&amp;#39; back?&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
