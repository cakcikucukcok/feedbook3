  <title>Set Me Free - Daniela Sacerdoti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the No. 1 bestselling author of Watch Over Me and Take Me Home , Daniela Sacerdoti returns to Glen Avich for her third book set in the magical and atmospheric Scottish Highlands. Set Me Free is a hauntingly beautiful story of love, loss and new beginnings. Margherita&#39;s marriage is slowly falling apart. Getting pregnant after trying for so long may have been a wonderful surprise for her, but for her husband it was the last straw. When she needs him most, she realises he&#39;s just not there for her. Needing time away to figure out where their marriage is going, Margherita decides to leave London and spend the summer in Glen Avich, to help out in her mum&#39;s new coffee shop. She needs to reconnect with her adopted daughter Lara and her young son and sort out her life. But Glen Avich can have a strange effect on people, and when she and Lara start working for Torcuil Ramsay at a rundown local estate, everything begins to change. Margherita finds her heart awakened in a way she never thought possible and Lara begins a new friendship with a mysterious local boy, Mal, which makes her mother feel increasingly uneasy. And just when Margherita is finally beginning to discover what she really wants, she finds out how quickly things can change and how hard it can be to make brave choices. Also Available as a free eBook: Margherita&#39;s Recipes: Free Recipes from Daniela Sacerdoti&#39;s Bestselling Novel, Set Me Free PRAISE FOR SET ME FREE &#39;An absolute joy to read, the story is engaging, the characters are believable and the writing is lovely... is definitely a book to add to the summer reading list, and one that you won&#39;t be able to put down.&#39; THE PRESS AND JOURNAL &#39;I defy you not to fall in love with the place, the characters and the writing.&#39; LISA READS BOOKS &#39;A completely delightful book, which I devoured in a couple of sittings... Dani&#39;s writing is just wonderful, intense and beautiful and I could read her writing all day long.&#39; KIM THE BOOKWORM &#39;The romance and emotion oozes from the page. This is definitely a book to read, this is a book that blew me away.&#39; COMPELLING READS &#39;Dani&#39;s adult books have the power to cast a spell over the reader; they are absolutely enchanting in a raw and powerful way.&#39; BOOK LOVE BUG" />
