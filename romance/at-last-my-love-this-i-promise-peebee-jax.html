  <title>At Last My Love-This I Promise - Peebee Jax</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When two hearts become one, both happiness and sometimes sadness will find a place in that seemingly perfect union.  As much happiness as we shared, when I look back over our life together, I was blessed that God allowed me to experience such joy and love every day with a man who not only made promises but kept those promises.  Even though I have also witnessed sadness to an unimaginable degree since his unexpected death, I can truly say I was still blessed to have loved and been loved to a magnitude I do not have words to describe.
     A lifetime cannot be defined in terms of hours, days, years, decades or century.  Regardless of the length of time any relationship lasts, we must learn to live every minute like it is our last.  That is what my one true love taught me!  He added truth, honesty, love and devotion together and we had a sum total of joy and happiness divided by the number of offsprings produced by that love.  And we never parted in anger or unforgiveness--because no one can predict what the next minute will bring.  Sometimes I think my love was just too wise for this world--that is why God called him home to be with Him.
     As I look back over our life together, I feel enormously blessed by God to have had such a love as this in my lifetime.  Only God made it possible.  Only God allowed me to experience total bliss for a little while (29.8 years).  Words cannot describe the memories stored in my memory bank of our span of time together.  In all my days of blissful retreat, the only thing I feel I did not do enough of is giving grateful praise to the Almighty for creating that soul mate just for me and I for him.  Life will go on and in each whisk of air against my skin as I sit and read, I will remember it is you my love stopping by to see me every now and then.
              God saw you were getting tired;
          So He did what He knew was best.
               He watched and waited for the exact time,
          You were in most need of some rest.
               You did not say to me farewell;
           Nor even a wave good-bye.
                God took you swift and easy--
           I dare not ask God why.
                 He gave you to me for a while;
            I loved you with all my heart,
                 I showed you, I told you daily,
            Even in death, we are not apart.
                 Rest easy Honey until I get there,
             I will know you when I arrive.
                 We will be just two angels forever,
             Always--partners--side by side." />
