  <title>Christmas at Hope Cottage - Lily Graham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;In the little village of Whistling, with its butterscotch cottages and rolling green hills, snow is beginning to fall. Christmas is coming, and Emma Halloway is on her way home.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When twenty-eight-year-old food writer &lt;b&gt;Emma Halloway&lt;/b&gt; gets dumped then knocked off her bike, she&amp;#x2019;s broken in more ways than one, and returns to her family&amp;#x2019;s cosy cottage in the Yorkshire Dales. Emma hasn&amp;#x2019;t been back in some time, running from her crazy relatives and her childhood sweetheart, &lt;b&gt;Jack Allen&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Emma&amp;#x2019;s grandmother is determined to bake her back to health and happiness, as the Halloways have done for generations. Surrounded by old friends and warm cinnamon buns, Emma starts to believe in her family&amp;#x2019;s special talents for healing again. But then in walks Jack with his sparkling hazel eyes, stirring up the family feud between them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the twinkly lights are strung between the streetlamps, Emma remembers just why she fell for Jack in the first place... and why a Halloway should never date an Allen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The infuriating new lodger, &lt;b&gt;Sandro&lt;/b&gt;, doesn&amp;#x2019;t believe anyone should have to choose between love and family. With a little bit of Christmas magic, can Emma and Jack find a way to be together, or will Emma find herself heartbroken once more?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;An utterly gorgeous Christmas romance about the importance of family, freshly baked biscuits, and learning to trust your heart. Perfect for fans of Phillipa Ashley, Debbie Johnson and Debbie Macomber.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;Christmas at Hope Cottage&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;I couldn&#39;t put this down&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;read it in one sitting&lt;/b&gt;.&amp;#x2019; Goodreads Reviewer, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;I &lt;b&gt;absolutely adored this book&lt;/b&gt;.
