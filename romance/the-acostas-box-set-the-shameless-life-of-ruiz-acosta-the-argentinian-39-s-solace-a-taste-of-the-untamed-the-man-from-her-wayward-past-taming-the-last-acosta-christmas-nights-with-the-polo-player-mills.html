  <title>The Acostas Box Set: The Shameless Life of Ruiz Acosta / The Argentinian&#39;s Solace / A Taste of the Untamed / The Man From her Wayward Past / Taming the Last Acosta / Christmas Nights with the Polo Player (Mills &amp; Boon e-Book Collections) - Susan Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ACOSTAS BOX SET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Superb, passionate six book Modern Romance collection by Susan Stephens featuring the sexy, glamorous Argentinean Acosta family&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE SHAMELESS LIFE OF RUIZ ACOSTA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Valiant desperately needs hot new material for Rock! magazine. Luckily her temporary flatmate, sexy Argentine polo player Ruiz Acosta, is the perfect subject – who wouldn’t want to know everything about the agony and ecstasy of living with a playboy?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ARGENTINIAN’S SOLACE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diego Acosta’s polo-playing days are over. Living in self-imposed exile on his island idyll, he finds his nights are now filled with tormenting memories rather than the beautiful women who once graced his king-sized bed. When Maxie Parrish crashes into his solitude, radiating exuberance and a love of life, she burns so brightly he can’t take his eyes off her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A TASTE OF THE UNTAMED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wild, unpredictable polo champion Nacho Acosta is restoring his sprawling Argentinian vineyard and he needs a sommelier who can match his exacting tastes…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt; THE MAN FROM HER WAYWARD PAST&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A paler, quieter Lucia’s gone from owning the dance floor to cleaning it, when a ghost from parties past walks in…&lt;br /&gt;Luke Forster would recognise those curves anywhere – he grew up hypnotised by them! The real Lucia Acosta is still in there somewhere, and he’s the man to tempt her out…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAMING THE LAST ACOSTA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living vicariously through a camera lens, photojournalist Romy Winner is happy to stay in the background, capturing other people’s happiness. Until Argentinian polo champion turned Special Forces soldier Kruz Acosta challenges her to step out of the shadows – and into his bed!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CHRISTMAS NIGHTS WITH THE POLO PLAYER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucy Lavender knows she should resist wickedly sexy boss, and Brazilian polo champion, Gabe Ortoya. Playboy Gabe is vet Lucy&#39;s ticket to a career in equine medicine and she&#39;s going to make full use of her valuable new contact, which means no mixing business with pleasure…&lt;/p&gt;
