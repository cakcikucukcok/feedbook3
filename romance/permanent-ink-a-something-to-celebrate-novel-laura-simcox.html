  <title>Permanent Ink (A Something to Celebrate Novel) - Laura Simcox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Blair Whitaker has one goal: get the hell out of Celebration, NY. Her ticket out is helping the town take the grand prize in a parade contest, which will ensure she lands her dream job. It&#39;s a win-win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing in the way is Ben Lambert, a sexy, local tattoo artist whose smile makes her weak. To win the contest, she&#39;ll have to sideline his plans for the tattoo festival the town council allowed on the same weekend. But trying to thwart Ben is more than she bargained for, and before she knows it, she&#39;s starting to see Celebration-and Ben-as something more than a temporary distraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Blair&#39;s in too deep to change directions now. Celebration is behind the parade contest, the mayor revokes the tattoo festival permit, and Blair is on the cusp of getting everything she&#39;d planned.  But coming clean will turn Ben against her for good, and going forward means losing what she really wants and hurting the town she&#39;s grown to love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Something to Celebrate series is a standalone, full-length story that can be enjoyed out of order. &lt;br&gt;Series Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Ivy Entwined&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Permanent Ink&lt;/p&gt;" />
