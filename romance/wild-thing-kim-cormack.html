  <title>Wild Thing - Kim Cormack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a dark past, a teenage girl comes back from the dead and becomes a hit-man for a clan of immortals.&amp;nbsp;?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Some people are born into this world kicking and screaming. They calm down and manage to find a way to fit into society. They have a mother and a father or perhaps only one of those two. Alexandria Abrelle was the name that had appeared on her birth certificate. Lexy had never known this girl. Lexy had come quietly and subserviently into the world, born to a mother, in a coma during her gestation. She was taken from her mother&amp;rsquo;s womb as she slipped away into her next life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lexy had been living in group homes and foster care as long as she could remember. There had only been a few that felt right, but either she&amp;rsquo;d outgrown them or perhaps &amp;hellip;they just hadn&amp;#39;t wanted her anymore. She&amp;rsquo;d never been given a reason. When it came time to leave the last home she&amp;rsquo;d been at for a few years, she decided to run away with a few of the older ones. They were all tired of allowing someone else to control their lives. They&amp;#39;d planned to hitchhike across the country. It had seemed like a brilliant idea at the time.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She had been reborn in a place far worse than any version of hell, one could imagine. After many years lost in places void of humanity, Grey found her.&amp;nbsp; He introduced her to a partially immortal family.&amp;nbsp; She&amp;rsquo;d been saved in so many ways by the Ankh. They were the family that she had always been destined to find. They would teach her to embrace the dragon that resided within. She would learn that both the dark side of her spirit and light were equally important. Lexy would learn of necessary evil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
