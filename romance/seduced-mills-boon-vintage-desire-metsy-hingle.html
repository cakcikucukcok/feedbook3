          &lt;strong&gt;Wanted: Wife and Mother Michael Grayson needed a wife.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He had custody of his orphaned niece, but her rich, ruthless grandmother wanted the girl, and Michael was afraid he&#39;d lose the child. Still, he wouldn&#39;t have to worry - if sensuous, beautiful Amanda Bennett would agree to become his instant bride, proving to the authorities that Michael could provide a stable home.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Amanda had been burned before. She knew all about men who pretended to offer love but only wanted a live-in housekeeper. While she&#39;d grown fond of the little girl, she&#39;d also fallen hard for the man - and she wouldn&#39;t be seduced into marriage unless he proved his intentions were honorable.&lt;/p&gt;
