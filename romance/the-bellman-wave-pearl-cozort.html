      <meta name="description" content="Professor Jenny Spencer is working for Knolls University. After the mysterious death of her mentor and boss, Big Ed. She asked to take his place at a poker group that meets once a month. This group has a secret agenda, keeping watch over what&#39;s left of a time machine. Jenny has something the rest of these men want, and they will do anything to get it. 
Only Yuri is there to help her. He knows that people can&#39;t travel through time. He and Jenny struggle with their grief over Big Ed&#39;s death. He is there to help her step back from her madness, and he finds himself falling in love. Sitting with her as they watch the fire, to help bring them peace. 
It is also the tale of Anna Evans who has to choose between the man she loves and saving her America from the ravages of war. Anna fights the growing sickness of her body, as her world begins to fall apart.
Both have waited a long time for love to come to them. Both must leave it behind. One for the sake of her sanity, and the other for the sake of her country." />
