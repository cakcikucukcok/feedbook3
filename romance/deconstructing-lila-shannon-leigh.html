  <title>Deconstructing Lila - Shannon Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Preservationist Lila Gentry returns to her small Texas hometown to restore the famous Chisholm Trail whorehouse where her great-great-grandmother was a madam in the 1880s. On her agenda is winning back Jake, the one that got away. But how do you rope a man who doesn&#39;t want to be wrangled?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake lives by one creed:  Keep it simple. His ex showing up in town complicates his life and makes him think about things he&#39;d rather forget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lila&#39;s restoration project is threatened before it even begins, she turns to Jake for help. Working together stirs up old feelings, but while Lila and Jake always sizzle between the sheets--or wherever the moment takes them--it will involve some sweet-talking and finesse to bring these two together.&lt;/p&gt;" />
