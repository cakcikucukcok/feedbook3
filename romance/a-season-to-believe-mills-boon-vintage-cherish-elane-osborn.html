          &lt;strong&gt;WHO AM I?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She asked. But no one knew. A near-fatal accident had stolen Jane&#39;s past, and now she struggled daily with her new life. Only the knowledge that policeman Matt Sullivan was rooting for her kept her going. But when flashes of her memory returned, Jane grew afraid she wouldn&#39;t like the person she used to be….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And so she turned once more to Matt. Now a private detective, he vowed that this time he&#39;d discover the truth about Jane. And this time no one would be able to hurt her in mind or body. Because suddenly Matt was realizing that the new Jane was everything he&#39;d dreamed of getting for Christmas….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But could he keep her?&lt;/p&gt;
