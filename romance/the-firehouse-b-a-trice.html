  <title>The Firehouse - B.A. Trice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Margaret is a Kentucky belle, and Rich is a Wyoming cowboy. She has struggled to find direction in her life, while he is still dealing with the fallout from his fractured marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of their differing backgrounds, they become fast friends as soon as they meet and are soon working together and sharing an apartment in New York City in late summer of 2001 as they try to put their lives back on track. Together, they run the Firehouse, a small but thriving restaurant in a century-old building a few blocks from Grand Central Station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they grow closer, the broken pieces of their lives begin to mend. They experience the adventure that living in New York can offer, and the day-to-day lives that they lead are punctuated with the glitz as well as the tragedy that life in the city has to offer. Only time will tell, however, whether they can manage to let go of their pasts in order to allow true healing to start and love to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This novel tells the story of two wanderers brought together by fate as they work to break down the barriers that have kept them apart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
