  <title>How to Marry a Warlock in 10 Days - Saranna DeWylde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Got Warlock?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Middy Cherrywood does. She&#39;s got more warlock than she can hex with Dred Shadowins. He isn&#39;t just a billionaire playboy and Weekly Warlock centerfold. He&#39;s a spy for the High Chancellor, and he convinces Middy to pose as his fianc&amp;#233;e for his latest mission. Too bad no one told his mother before she slipped Middy a potion that will make their sham engagement all too real in just ten days. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dred Shadowins already has his hands full with cursed objects, possessed nuns, and dreams where Merlin makes him pay for taking his name in vain by relating his sexcapades with Nimue. But by the end of the mission, he&#39;s convinced his most difficult challenge is the hero&#39;s cape Middy&#39;s draped over his shoulders. Because he wants nothing more than to give her the one thing he may not be capable of providing: Happily Ever After. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for How to Lose a Demon in 10 Days&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Funny, sexy, and wild!&quot; --Cynthia Eden&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Grace + Caspian = LOL demonic lovin&#39; fun!&quot; --Dakota Cassidy, author of &lt;i&gt;The Accidental Series&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Brash, sexy and funny as hell.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Angie Fox" />
