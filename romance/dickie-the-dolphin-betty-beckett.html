  <title>Dickie the Dolphin - Betty Beckett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Things really take a taboo turn in the small town of Bugtussle! When arrogant and stuck up Bianca reports on the latest addition to Bugtussle&amp;rsquo;s zoo, the horny men around her can&amp;rsquo;t wait to humiliate her&amp;mdash;in the most degrading way possible. This desperate mother finds herself willing to do anything for her son to keep the video from surfacing&amp;mdash;even if she must submit to his kinky and sadistic desires!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
Giggling, short of breath, Bianca&amp;rsquo;s eyes found the camera. She said, &amp;ldquo;Folks, this is absolutely unbelievable. Bring the family, you are going to love it! Dickie the Dolphin appeared at her side, and she stroked its sleek flank.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wondrously, it seemed to nuzzle her 32C breasts with its snout.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He&amp;rsquo;s so adorable!&amp;rdquo; Bianca exclaimed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From the feeding platform on the side of the great tank, the trainer called out a warning, &amp;ldquo;Hey, be careful!&amp;rdquo; Then he started peeling off his khakis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Such friendly animals,&amp;rdquo; Bianca was saying to the camera. &amp;ldquo;Notice how they always look like they&amp;rsquo;re smiling!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dickie the Dolphin slapped his tail on the surface and pushed even closer. Bianca threw both arms across the slippery mammal, which obligingly rolled on its back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jimmy Lee saw the trainer hysterically dive into the water on the other side of the pool. He saw his mother&amp;rsquo;s expression change from tenderness to awe as it hooked its nose under her bikini top, and with a quick flick of his nose, raised it above her breasts. Next he watched as the dolphin hooked her with its flippers and drag her down into the water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she finally broke the surface, her top went directly to the bottom, and Bianca&amp;rsquo;s giggle became a low fearful moan. As the dolphins dark form appeared beneath her, she seemed to rise from the water. Then, just as slowly, the creature drew her down under the water.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The cameraman muttered something about soon running out of video memory. A voice behind Jimmy Lee yelled, &amp;ldquo;Don&amp;rsquo;t miss the best part!&amp;rdquo;" />
