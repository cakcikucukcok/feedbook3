  <title>Romancing the Klondike - Joan Donadlson-Yarmey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1896 and nineteen-year-old Pearl Owens wants adventure just like her idols Anna Leonowens and Annie &quot;Londonderry&quot; Choen Kopchovsky. In the 1860s, Anna Leonowens taught the wives, concubines, and children of the King of Siam, while during the years 1894-1895, Annie &quot;Londonderry&quot; Choen Kopchovsky became the first woman to travel around the world on a bicycle. She was testing a woman&#39;s ability to look after herself. To fulfill her dream Pearl is on her to the Yukon River area with her cousin, Emma, to write articles and do illustrations about the woman and men who are looking for gold in the far north. Sam Owens, Pearl&#39;s cousin and Emma&#39;s brother, has been searching for gold with two friends, Gordon and Donald, for five years without success. Gordon and Donald have decided their quest is futile and it is time to return home. But Sam wants to stay a while longer. Then they hear word of a new gold find on Rabbit Creek. Over the next ten months, the lives of all five are changed due to love, gold, and tragedy." />
