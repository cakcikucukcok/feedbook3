  <title>Savage Atonement (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She wanted to punish him–not love him!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When she was fifteen Laurel had been the victim of an attempted rape, and Oliver Savage was the reporter who had twisted her story, tearing her reputation to shreds and leaving her fearful of every man who came too near.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, six years later, he was anxious to right his wrong. &quot;I want to help you, Laurel&quot;, he&#39;d offered. But Laurel didn&#39;t want his help–she wanted retribution. She found it was not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He was a stimulating man, and his every caress weakened her desire for revenge….&lt;/p&gt;
