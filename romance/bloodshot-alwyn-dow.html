Part 2 is called Croquet at Chateau Chevalier and sees Sue embroiled in a murder at a Management Motivational weekend in a country hotel run by a company called Muck&amp;Brass, a term that alludes to their penchant for outdoor trials, such as Quad Bikes. There are so many suspects, but here the onus is on lack of conscience as people make their decisions. Sue has been moved up to Sergeant.
Part 3 is Troublesome Talk at River Walk and is set in Frome, a small town near Bath where Sue has been promoted to Inspector. It begins with the suspicious death of an old lady and goes on to explore her background in the Spanish Civil War, and in the Resistance in World War Two. This story highlights the dilemma that is faced by individuals, when competing definitions of right and wrong clash.
