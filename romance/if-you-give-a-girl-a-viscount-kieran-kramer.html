  <title>If You Give A Girl A Viscount - Kieran Kramer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If life were a fairy tale, Daisy Montgomery&#39;s stepmother and two stepsisters would surely be cast in the wicked roles. For years, they&#39;ve made life miserable for Daisy. But when she discovers she has a godmother, she&#39;s determined to ask her for help. Little did Daisy expect her godmother to play matchmaker with her very own grandson--who happens to be a viscount!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A freewheeling playboy, Charles Thorpe, Viscount Lumley, is bored with his wealth-seeking female admirers. Not only that, he&#39;s been cut off from the family coffers. One day, on a bet, he rids himself of what little money he has left in his pockets and vows to solve problems using his wits alone. But when the Impossible Bachelor is confronted with Daisy&#39;s plan to save her castle, the payoff is more than he could have bargained for. Sometimes, if you give a girl a viscount, you just might find love....&lt;/p&gt;" />
