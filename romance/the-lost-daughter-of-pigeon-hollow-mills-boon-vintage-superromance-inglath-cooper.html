            &lt;em&gt;Willa Addison doesn&#39;t believe in fairy tales&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She&#39;s too busy running her mother&#39;s diner and raising her wild teenage sister. She doesn&#39;t like to dwell on the dreams she once had, dreams she put on hold. Then Owen Miller walks into her diner and changes her life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She doesn&#39;t know what to think when Owen hands her a letter from her father–a father she thought was dead–requesting they meet. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, her sister has become more than she can handle. It&#39;s time for Willa to figure out what&#39;s happened to her life. And maybe, with Owen around, she can finally believe in happily ever after….&lt;/p&gt;
