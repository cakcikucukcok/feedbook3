  <title>One Night In His Arms (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) (Penny Jordan Collection) - Penny Jordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Penny Jordan needs no introduction as arguably the most recognisable name writing for Mills &amp; Boon. We have celebrated her wonderful writing with a special collection, many of which for the first time in eBook format and all available right now.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;She&#39;d break his self-control!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Still shamed by her teenage infatuation with Ranulf Carrington, Sylvie knew it was important that he understand they were now meeting on equal terms. She would do her utmost to play it cool and distant—his cruel words at their last meeting had crushed the youthful passion out of her—so that all they shared now was a purely business relationship!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everything was different, yet nothing had changed—Sylvie&#39;s body still ached for his. Maybe Ran would never come to love her, but still she knew she&#39;d do almost anything for just one night in his arms….&lt;/p&gt;
