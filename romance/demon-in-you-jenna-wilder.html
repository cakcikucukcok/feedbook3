  <title>Demon in You - Jenna Wilder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jane Williams was never a normal teenage girl. From the moment she was born she was given this task. She had this mission and journey that she had to set out on from the moment she came onto this earth. Though growing up in a foster home she didn&#39;t know much about yourself. When Jane was left on the steps as a infant she believed that no one wanted her or loved her. That there was nothing special about her. But all that changes as she grows up. And the more she grows the more she see&#39;s. 
        The more the nightmare&#39;s and dreams come to her at night and show her the dangers she will come across. Not to mention the overwhelming amount of responsibility that she will have to bare on shoulders.
           She never thought her teenage life could become anymore troubling then it is now. But with one bad dream. You would have never thought it would lead to so much questions and surprises. 
     An Uncle that is barely your uncle comes into your life. Sprouting out nonsense of destiny and a fight with heaven and hell over her. And it was one thing to have men fight over her. But never once did she think that two of the most powerful things in the world would be fighting to have her. But either one can literally kill her. 
        Not something that you wish to hear during your days as a sixteen year old. And things only begin to grow from bad to worst for her. It seems to be one gigantic roller coaster ride for her. And if you are willing to take that ride then you will see all the rough turns it will take her." />
