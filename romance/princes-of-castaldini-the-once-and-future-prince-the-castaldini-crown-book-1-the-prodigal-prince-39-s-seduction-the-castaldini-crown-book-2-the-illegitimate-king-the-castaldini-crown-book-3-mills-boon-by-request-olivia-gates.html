        &lt;p&gt;Leandro D’Agostino had gone into exile. Now Phoebe Alexander, once Leandro’s secret lover, is being sent to convince him to accept the crown. But she’d refused exile with him and her betrayal still fed Leandro’s anger. He would rule only if Phoebe bowed to his wishes…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;THE PRODIGAL PRINCE&#39;S SEDUCTION&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Prince Durante D’Agostino was used to receiving incredible offers. Yet the woman attached to this one had come to bring him back to Castaldini to become its king. After one fiery night, Durante believed Gabrielle was meant to rule by his side. Until he discovered her real identity… The Illegitimate King Six years ago she’d scorned him and illegitimate secret prince Ferruccio Selvaggio had sworn he would make her pay. Now, Princess Clarissa D’Agostino was in his power.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was time to teach her a lesson… in desire.&lt;/p&gt;
