  <title>A Different Kind of Normal - Cathy Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From acclaimed author Cathy Lamb comes a warm and poignant story about mothers and sons, family and forgiveness--and loving someone enough to let them be true to themselves.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaden Bruxelle knows that life is precious. She sees it in her work as a hospice nurse, a job filled with compassion and humor even on the saddest days. And she sees it in Tate, the boy she has raised as her son ever since her sister gave him up at birth. Tate is seventeen, academically brilliant, funny, and loving. He&#39;s also a talented basketball player despite having been born with an abnormally large head--something Jaden&#39;s mother blames on a family curse. Jaden dismisses that as nonsense, just as she ignores the legends about witches and magic in the family. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Over the years, Jaden has focused all her energy on her job and on sheltering Tate from the world. Tate, for his part, just wants to be a regular kid. Through his blog, he&#39;s slowly reaching out, finding his voice. He wants to try out for the Varsity basketball team. He wants his mom to focus on her own life for a change, maybe even date again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jaden knows she needs to let go--of Tate, of her fears and anger, and of the responsibilities she uses as a shield. And through a series of unexpected events and revelations, she&#39;s about to learn how. Because as dear as life may be, its only real value comes when we are willing to live it fully, even if that means risking it all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beautifully written, tender and true, &lt;i&gt;A Different Kind of Normal &lt;/i&gt; is a story about embracing love and adventure, and learning to look ahead for the first time.  .  ." />
