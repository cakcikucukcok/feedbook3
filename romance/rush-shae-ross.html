  <title>Rush - Shae Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;They&#39;re changing the rules...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;College Quarterback Preston Rush is living the dream. He&#39;s leading his team to the National Championship and days away from earning a &#39;first round draft pick&#39; label. When he meets Little Bo Peep at a Halloween party, he thinks he&#39;s scored big. Instead, he wakes up in a jail cell with the corseted beauty. Because of him, she&#39;s in trouble and when he discovers her true identity, he realizes, his nightmare is just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The always shooting-for-perfection Priscilla Winslow can&#39;t believe her good deed has cost her a soccer career. Even though she knows it isn&#39;t Preston&#39;s fault, she can&#39;t forgive him for the disaster that is her life. She just wishes her damn body would get the message. Every time she sees him, it&#39;s all she can do not to kiss him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When everything crashes down around him, Preston will have to decide if doing the right thing is worth losing it all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
