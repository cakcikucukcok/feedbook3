  <title>When a Man Loves a Weapon - Toni McGee Causey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Living single in her trailer was great for a time. But now Bobbie Faye&#39;s officially engaged to, and has purchased a home with, the hottest FBI agent on the beat: Trevor Cormier. Even though she still has no idea what he &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;does on the job, Bobbie Faye has never been happier...until Trevor gets called away on an urgent assignment and leaves her in the care of body-guard slash babysitter Riley.  &lt;br&gt;As it turns out, Bobbie Faye could use a little extra security. The man she helped put in behind bars, the murderous Sean MacGreggor, has escaped from prison...and is dead-set on revenge. With still no word from Trevor--who was only supposed to be gone for three days--Bobbie Faye finds herself reluctantly turning to her detective ex-boyfriend Cam for help. He&#39;s willing to do whatever it takes to protect Bobbie Faye...so long as Trevor stays out of the picture. &lt;i&gt;For good&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
