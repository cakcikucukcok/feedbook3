  <title>The Earl&#39;s Wager - Rebecca Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When straitlaced earl, Will Sutton, is challenged to turn the obstinate American ward of his friend into a biddable lady suitable for the Marriage Mart, he gladly takes the wager&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Then has to decide whether the prize--a prime racing stud horse--is worth changing the impudent beauty&#39;s temperament he&#39;s come to enjoy. Greatly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;One headstrong miss. One stuffy lord. One friendly wager. What could go wrong?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Will Sutton, the Earl of Grandleigh, believes he can save the family&#39;s impoverished estate by investing in a racehorse, but the price is too steep. His brother-in-law offers him a deal: tutor his American ward in proper English customs, so she&#39;ll be marriage material, and Will can have one of his horses. Maybe Miss Georgia Duvall prefers being a jockey, is obstinate and high spirited, but once she&#39;s cleaned up and presentable, he&#39;ll have no trouble finding her a quality suitor. She might even be quite pretty beneath the racetrack dust.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Georgia Duvall wants is to be married off to an English peer. But she won&#39;t defy her father&#39;s wishes, and sets her cap for the oldest lord she can find--a man who&#39;ll die quickly and leave her alone to manage her inheritance. The Earl of Grandleigh might think he&#39;ll teach her manners and marry her off to someone younger than eighty, but there hasn&#39;t been an obstacle yet Georgia can&#39;t overcome. Including a stuffy, overbearing English lord.&lt;/p&gt;" />
