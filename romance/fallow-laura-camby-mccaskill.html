  <title>Fallow - Laura Camby McCaskill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As she helplessly rides in a carriage steered by her kidnappers, the only thing Adine can do is wait. The marketplace is ahead of her and her future is growing dimmer with every mile. A short time later, she is sold into slavery with three other women, leaving her with nothingnot even hope. But everything changes when a band of Freedom Fighters storm their wagon and snatch Adine and her fellow captives from their new owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as Adine is left to wonder whether the men are really freedom fighters or slave traders in disguise, she struggles with her decision to trust them. As the caravan travels through a desert rampant with murderous slave traders, poisonous vipers, and an ex-slave with an evil mission, one Freedom Fighter appoints himself as Adines bodyguard. Drake must not only protect the nave girl from the dangers in the desert, but also from himself. As he tackles threats and attempts to keep Adine alive, his loyalty to the caravan is tested, leaving him with an agonizing choice and the power to transform Adines future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallow shares an exciting tale of adventure after a young girl is kidnapped, sold into slavery, and rescued by Freedom Fighters who lead her down a dangerous path where a new destiny awaits.&lt;/p&gt;" />
