          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Dermot-Dex Collection&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kate Hoffman continues her blisteringly hot&lt;em&gt; Might Quinns &lt;/em&gt;series in this six-book collection.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Dermot&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Salesman Dermot Quinn plays the smooth charmer to perfection. But when his grandfather issues a challenge to his grandsons—start a new life with next to nothing—Dermot finds himself on the doorstep of a Wisconsin farm. And now he’s face-to-face with a woman who makes him lose every bit of his cool!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Kieran&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;How do you start a life from scratch? On a quest set by his Irish grandfather, businessman Kieran Quinn is trying to figure that out when destiny comes sailing through the bus station door in the form of smokin’-hot country music star Maddie West. She&#39;s desperate and on the run. And Keiran’s future suddenly looks a lot like trouble…sexy, irresistible trouble!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Cameron &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yacht designer Cameron Quinn knows life can shift in a moment. But when he accepts his grandfather’s quest—six weeks to start over from scratch—he certainly isn’t expecting to be stranded in a dusty town in New Mexico. The upside? He’s found himself working for a stunning private investigator, Sofie Reyes,…and the heat between them is hotter than the desert!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Ronan &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There’s a curse in Sibleyville, Maine. Thanks to a long-ago feud between the Sibleys and the Quinns, residents are destined never to find lasting love together. Unfortunately, when Ronan Quinn steps off the bus in Sibleyville, he has no idea what he’s stepped in…until the very sexy Charlotte Sibley gives him a job, a room and the scoop on her family’s 200-year-old curse!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Logan &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s a long, hot trip from one side of Australia to the other, but horse breeder Logan Quinn has a job to do—sell his favourite filly, and dream of a home and a horse ranch of his own. When he stays over at posh horse farm, however, his dreams turn to fantasies about the owner’s daughter. And for just one night, he gives himself up to sweet surrender…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Jack &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It’s always been Jack Quinn and his widowed mother against the world. Then Jack’s mother decides to reunite with her childhood sweetheart all the way out in California, and there’s no question—Jack’s going with her, and to hell with the consequences…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Rourke &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rourke Quinn found her on the storm-tossed shores of Cape Breton. The woman in his arms was unconscious and bleeding. And Rourke knew her. Annie MacIntosh was the town outcast—a wild thing. And as untamed and beautiful as the Atlantic itself. This storm was just the thing to keep Rourke as close to her as he dared…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Mighty Quinns: Dex&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With her career on the line, Marlie Jenner is determined to make a top-notch documentary about beloved Irish author Aileen Quinn. Which means she needs a top-notch filmmaker; she needs Dex Kennedy. Dex is talented, well-respected and Irish. He&#39;s also hotter than hell. And when they meet, he looks as if he wants to eat Marlie right up!&lt;/p&gt;
