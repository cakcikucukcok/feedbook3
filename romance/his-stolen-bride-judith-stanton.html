  <title>His Stolen Bride - Judith Stanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;He Would Stop at Nothing to Get What He Wanted . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to succeed, Nicholas Blum leaves his beloved family to work for a shopkeeper in Pennsylvania. His stay won&#39;t be long, though, for once he proves himself he plans to return to his beloved North Carolina Moravian community to marry the golden sweetheart he&#39;s entrusted to his younger brother&#39;s care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last thing Nicholas wants is a female taskmaster who bosses him by day and invades his dreams at night&amp;#8212;no matter how lovely petite Abbigall Till may be. And Abbigail, the shop owner&#39;s spinster daughter, certainly doesn&#39;t need a big attractive man like Nicholas upsetting her shop and wreaking havoc with her heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Nicholas gets some shocking news&amp;#8212;his intended bride is to marry someone else. As he races home to stop the wedding, Nicholas is haunted by thoughts of the sweet, stubborn wren he&#39;s left behind. Abbigail too feels an aching despair over losing the man she belatedly realizes she loves. Will the strength of their love survive, or has their only chance at happiness been stolen forever? &lt;/p&gt;" />
