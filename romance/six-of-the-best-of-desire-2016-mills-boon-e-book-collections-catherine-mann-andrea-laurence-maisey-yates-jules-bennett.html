      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Six selected super passionate and exciting romances!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The best of Mills &amp; Boon Desire 2016&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HIS PREGNANT PRINCESS BRIDE Catherine Mann&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisiana billionaire Gervais Reynaud has no time for romance. But he can’t say no to a tryst with Erika Mitras. Their time together is all too short. When Erika said goodbye, she meant it. But now she must tell Gervais the truth. He’s about to be a father…to royal twins.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SAYING YES TO THE BOSS Andrea Laurence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real estate CEO Carson Newport is determined to build a children’s hospital and his PR director Georgia Adams finds the perfect place. Carson’s feelings for her are heating up during those long hours at the office!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKE ME, COWBOY Maisey Yates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#39;s just one of the boys, but Anna Brown needs to change that. Her brothers bet she can&#39;t land a date for a fancy charity event. So Anna turns to her best friend and the hottest bachelor in town…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRAPPED WITH THE TYCOON Jules Bennett&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braden O’Shea needs access to Zara Perkins—to her life, to her house. So he hires the stunning event planner. But after one magical dance, he finds himself driving her home in a snowstorm—only to be stranded by her side. And now that he’s had a taste of her, seduction is his only goal…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE RANCHER’S MARRIAGE PACT Kristi Gold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A marriage of convenience. Dallas Calloway is desperate to find a bride. If the billionaire’s not married by his birthday, his dreams will end thanks to his father’s will. So Paris Reynolds’s arrival at the ranch looks like the answer to his prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE RANCHER RETURNS Brenda Jackson&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning from active duty to find his ranch being dug up by a beautiful stranger isn’t the homecoming Navy SEAL Gavin Blake expected. Layla Harris is convinced there’s buried treasure on his land. But the only treasure this wealthy rancher wants to uncover is the professor’s secret desires! When Layla unearths family secrets—and mysterious threats—he vows to do whatever it takes to protect her.&lt;/p&gt;
