  <title>Witches’ Mountain - Gerald R. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Witches Mountain.
Streetwise Rick Johnson takes a detour suggested by a strange hillbilly, forcing him to leave the trusted highway and onto a virtually unknown mountain road. This leads him to the Black Mountain, a part of the world he has never before visited. 
The path of his journey challenges everything he thinks he knows of the world. Who would ever contemplate traveling back into the history of a mountain and its people? Who would expect to meet and talk to people long dead or nearly get himself killed by a phantom truck or come face-to-face with unworldly creatures intent on tasting his blood? Then there is his experience of a supernatural cleansing inferno.
How can he deal with traveling back and forth in time without going just a little crazy? Maybe its Kate, the beautiful green-eyed blonde in the old township who makes it possible, or is it the influence of the Spirit of Good on the mountain in its battle with the evil forces there? What is all the talk of a direct line of females since the seventeenth century who have the Talent, and does the lovely Kate have it too? Who is Granma Roberta? What has she to do with things? Is there really a contact back to Salem?
Things soon become apparent as to why Rick finds himself on The Mountain, as its residents reverentially refer to it. To the distant valley dwellers, it is known as something rather more mysterious: Witches Mountain." />
