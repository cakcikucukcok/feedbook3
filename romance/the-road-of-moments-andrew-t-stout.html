  <title>The Road of Moments - Andrew T. Stout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Andrew T. Stout, but I like to be called Drew and I am from Bristol, PA.
I started writing poetry at a young age to show how I was feeling. I always enjoyed reading poetry from Edgar Allen Poe. I wrestled and ran track in school. I loved to play sports. After High School graduation in 2002, I joined the U.S. Army as a Military Police Officer. My training was in Ft. Leonard Wood, MO. My first place of duty was Vilseck, Germany. During my three years in Germany, I was deployed two times and seen numerous other countries. Also during this three year overseas period, I met my wife Claudia. My love for poetry only grew more and more. If I was upset over something and it was out of my control, I would write a poem to calm my nerves. There are times where I can write a poem in five minutes and times where it may take a little time. The poem Scared Little Boy was written during a snow storm and only took me approx. 8 min. I give thanks to my family and most of all, my wife Claudia for inspiring me to write and for pushing me to continue to publish my poems. Thank you all. God bless." />
