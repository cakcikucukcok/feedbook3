  <title>Man of Honor - Diana Gardin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;A sexy, brooding hero and a feisty, fierce heroine make for undeniable chemistry and scorching heat.&quot; --Jay Crownover, &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br&gt;  The best rules are the ones worth breaking . . . &lt;br&gt;  After his mother&#39;s funeral, ex-Army Ranger Drake Sullivan wants only to disappear and drown his sorrows in whiskey. Then he sees her: Mea Jones. An untamed, sexy-as-hell whirlwind of energy. A few years ago, she showed him the best-and hottest-night of his life, then walked away without a backward glance. But he&#39;s never stopped wanting more.&lt;br&gt;  When it comes to guys, Mea has rules. One night. No dating. Whatever it takes to have control and keep it. With Drake, it&#39;s all heat and hurt and hunger, and pretty much the opposite of control. And that makes him dangerous as hell. Mea has her own demons, and falling in love-or even in lust-is strictly a no-go proposition. But she soon finds out Drake is incredibly single-minded when it comes to getting what he wants. And he&#39;s determined to be the exception to all her rules. &lt;br&gt;  Reader advisory: The heroine&#39;s past deals with dark elements some readers may find disturbing. Recommended for mature audiences only.&lt;br&gt;  &quot;&lt;i&gt;Man of Honor&lt;/i&gt; is sweet and sexy in all the right places.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author J.B. Salsbury  &quot;Top Pick! Intense, passionate, and gritty...If you love your heroines strong, your heroes even stronger, and want a book that will keep you reading past your bedtime, &lt;i&gt;Man of Honor&lt;/i&gt; is for you!&quot; --Harlequin Junkie  &quot;Drake and Mea set the pages on fire! I was hooked from the very start!&quot; --J.L. Berg, &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br&gt;  &quot;A heart wrenching story of the healing power of love. Gardin handles tough issues with sensitivity and poignant storytelling. &lt;i&gt;Man of Honor&lt;/i&gt; will have you rooting for Drake and Mia and reaching for the tissues.&quot; --Marie Meyer, author of &lt;i&gt;The Turning Point &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;An emotional, sexy, and touching read with two unforgettable and amazingly resilient characters. &lt;i&gt;Man of Honor &lt;/i&gt;is an utterly devour-able book and I loved every second!&quot; --Jillian Stein, READ-LOVE-BLOG" />
