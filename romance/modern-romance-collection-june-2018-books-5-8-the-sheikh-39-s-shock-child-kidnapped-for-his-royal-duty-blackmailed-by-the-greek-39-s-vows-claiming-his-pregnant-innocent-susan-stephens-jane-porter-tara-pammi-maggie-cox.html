      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Four sizzlingly sexy romances from Mills &amp; Boon!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sheikh&#39;s Shock Child&lt;/em&gt; by Susan Stephens&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Working aboard Sheikh Khalid’s luxury yacht, innocent laundress Millie hides in the shadows—until she succumbs to his touch. Overwhelmed by the intensity of their encounter, she doesn’t even realise his yacht has set sail—and soon she finds herself between his golden sheets! But becoming Khalid’s mistress isn’t the only consequence of their reckless desire…and Millie’s scandalous news will bind them, permanently!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kidnapped for His Royal Duty &lt;/em&gt;by Jane Porter&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When desert prince Dal’s convenient bride is stolen, he must find a replacement—immediately. Suddenly shy secretary Poppy is kidnapped by her merciless boss and whisked away to his kingdom. She’s shocked to find herself willingly surrendering to his expert seduction! But when it becomes clear that Dal has more than pleasure in mind, will Poppy be persuaded to accept his royal proposal?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackmailed by the Greek&#39;s Vows&lt;/em&gt; by Tara Pammi&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Valentina always believed in the longing that consumed her and husband Kairos—until her devastating discovery that her marriage was a cold-hearted business deal. Despite their undeniable chemistry, she refuses to remain bound to the ruthless Greek. But before granting a divorce, Kairos demands she play his adoring wife again. And when their intense fire reignites, Valentina is at the mercy of her own desire…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Claiming His Pregnant Innocent &lt;/em&gt;by Maggie Cox&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Lily meets the landlord threatening to evict her, she doesn’t expect gorgeous tycoon Bastian Carrera! Heated antagonism leads to an extraordinarily sensual encounter, and shocking consequences. To claim his child—and the woman with whom he found such bliss—Bastian demands Lily meet him at the altar. But with only his ring to give, can she ever truly be his?&lt;/p&gt;
