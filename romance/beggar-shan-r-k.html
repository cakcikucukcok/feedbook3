  <title>Beggar - Shan R.K</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I was on the streets, until I wasn&#39;t. They took me, fed me, clothed me. For a time I was happy, until he came back. I had five years to accept his chains, my monster. He owned me, until I met the Enforcer of The Satan Snipers.  His name was Zero.   He wasn&#39;t just an enforcer. He was a stone blooded killer.  Beggar:-  I&#39;ve never known a day of being normal or having a hot plate of food to eat. I don&#39;t even know what it feels like to have a bath. The streets of Washington has been my home since the day I was born. As the years went on by, I learnt to survive on these streets, I even learnt to smile.   Now meet   Zero:-  I know I should let it rest, but I can&#39;t drop it. I need to know her name. My gut is riding me hard. My instincts are telling me it&#39;s important.   I&#39;m the enforcer. If there&#39;s even a thread that she&#39;s a danger to my club I need to know.   &quot;When I was younger I was a beggar by circumstance, when I got older I remained a beggar by choice.&quot; Beggar" />
