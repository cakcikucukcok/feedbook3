  <title>Mother In A Moment: Mother In A Moment / Millionaire&#39;s Instant Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Allison Leigh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Two favorite stories of instant families and everlasting love from bestselling author Allison Leigh.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Mother in a Moment&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking in five newly orphaned kids wasn&#39;t on CEO Garrett Callum&#39;s agenda. But he had made a promise to his dying sister that he would look after them, and he would do whatever it took to honor that vow. Only he never expected that persuading the nurse he met at the hospital to help him with the &quot;Fearsome Five&quot; would be his biggest challenge yet. Darby White was sure that if Garrett knew her secrets, he wouldn&#39;t let his charges anywhere near her. And yet how could she refuse? The children and their father offered her a chance at a family, redemption…and love.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Millionaire&#39;s Instant Baby&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tycoon Kyle Montgomery was a closer. He made deals ruthlessly and by any means necessary. Including acquiring an instant wife and baby. He even had the perfect candidates: Emma Valentine and her son. The arrogant and devilishly cool Kyle wasn&#39;t the husband Emma dreamed of–he was much, much more. He offered her a home, and gave her son the chance to have the life she wanted for him. And in return she could offer Kyle a different kind of deal–one that lasted forever.&lt;/p&gt;
