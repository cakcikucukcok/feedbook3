          &lt;strong&gt;THEY HAD PASTS THEY WANTED TO FORGET&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And Seth Dalton wasn&#39;t &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; to reveal the truth about his–not even to the tempting auburn-haired enigma who&#39;d haunted him. Childhood secrets guaranteed marriage would never be in Seth&#39;s future. So &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; was he sharing close quarters with the one woman who challenged his vow?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amelia Miller&#39;s sprained ankle would heal–thanks to her uninvited caregiver. But Seth&#39;s heated looks and tender ministrations reopened wounds she thought time had long mended. Amelia knew she could help the emotionally guarded Dalton find peace–but first they &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; had to overcome the pain in their pasts and learn to love again….&lt;/p&gt;
