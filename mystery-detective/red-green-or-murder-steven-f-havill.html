  <title>Red, Green, or Murder - Steven F Havill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Former Posadas County Sheriff Bill Gastner, now a New Mexico Livestock Inspector, is enjoying a day on Herb Torrance&#39;s ranch-soaking in the sun as he counts a small herd of cattle and thinking about an upcoming lunch with an old friend back in town. But a light breeze stirs dust, a horse spooks, and Bill finds himself ferrying a broken cowpuncher in the back of his SUV,  headed out to meet an ambulance. Moments later, Bill&#39;s day goes from bad to worse as he is summoned by undersheriff Estelle Reyes-Guzman to an investigation of an unattended death. Too impatient for Bill to finish up out at the ranch, old George Payton had decided to eat lunch on his own. A couple of bites later, he collapsed-dead of an apparent heart attack. But something isn&#39;t right. It may well have been a heart attack, Estelle agrees, but something triggered it. Before any questions can be answered, the small herd of cattle Bill had just counted is found wandering down a county highway. But there&#39;s no sign of cowpuncher Pat Gabaldon or his boss&#39; $40,000 truck and livestock trailer. Forced into two tangled investigations, Bill faces one of the most complex cases in his 35-year career." />
