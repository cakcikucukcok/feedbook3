  <title>Deadly Election - Lindsey Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the first century A.D., during Domitian&#39;s reign, Flavia Albia is  ready for a short break from her family. So despite the oppressive July  heat, she returns to Rome, leaving them at their place on the coast.  Albia, daughter of Marcus Didius Falco, the famed private informer (now  retired), has taken up her father&#39;s former profession, and it&#39;s time to  get back to work. The first order of business, however, is the corpse  that was found in a chest sent as part of a large lot to be sold by the  Falco family auction house. As the senior family representative in Rome,  it falls upon Albia to identify the corpse, find out why he was killed,  who killed him, and, most important, how did it end up in the chest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At  the same time, her potential young man, Faustus, comes looking for help  with his friend Sextus&#39;s political campaign. Between the auction  business and Roman politics, it&#39;s not quite clear which one is the more  underhanded and duplicitous. Both, however, are tied together by the  mysterious body in the chest, and if Albia isn&#39;t able to solve that  mystery, it won&#39;t be the only body to drop.&lt;/p&gt;" />
