  <title>A Stab at Life - Richard King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A series of murders in Montreal park near the Gursky Memorial Hospital have Nurse Annie Linton and Detective Gilles Bellechasse hopping. Suspects include a vigilante group fighting drug dealers, a jealous husband, competing drug dealers, and a mysterious woman of whom nude drawings turn up in a murder victim&#39;s bedroom. Annie Linton, a nurse turned sleuth, reveals excellent diagnostic skills critical in solving the crime.
Former bookseller Richard King has created two memorable characters in A Stab at Life. No other mystery writer has made a nurse (a woman) the lead character and situated the action in a hospital milieu. King&#39;s mysteries are reminiscent of the originators of the mystery genre, writers such as Agatha Christie and Rex Stout and modern writers such as Robert Goldsborough and Louise Penny. A Stab at Life will delight murder mystery fans  and have them waiting impatiently for the next in the series.
&quot;...he has talent, wit and Montreal.&quot; Margaret Cannon, Globe and Mail
&quot;A Stab at Life is a top-notch Montreal crime tale. When it comes to masterful storytelling, Richard is King.&quot; Andreas Kessaris, bookseller and author of The Butcher of Park Ex &amp; Other Semi-Truthfull Tales" />
