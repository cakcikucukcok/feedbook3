  <title>Backfire - Ron Boggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;CHICAGO-THE GEM OF THE PRAIRIE-EARLY AUTUMN,  1871&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
The city was alive. Raw materials and finished goods moved as fast as the new railroads and lake schooners could carry them. Wisconsin white pine lumber was big business in a city composed of thousands of wooden structures connected by wooden sidewalks and wooden-block streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Competition was fierce, ruthless, and deadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Eau Claire lumberman is killed in his hotel room and a competitor, Arlyn Rygg, from Green Bay, must work with the police to find the real killer in order to exonerate himself. His inquiries draw him into a maelstrom of intrigue and deception. Ultimately he races through the Great Fire and learns more than he ever wanted to know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Natural Drift&lt;/i&gt;, a contemporary Western action mystery pinning a Montana County Sheriff against a rogue U.S. Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;
I am writing to let you know how much I enjoyed your novel, Natural Drift. I found it to be a very good read with a realistic plot and well developed characters. I honestly could not put it down once I started it.&lt;/br&gt;
