  <title>Hell&#39;s Bay - James W. Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Master of suspense James W. Hall&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hell&#39;s Bay &lt;/i&gt;sends Thorn deep into the wilds of South Florida, in a story with all the haunting atmosphere of &lt;i&gt;Deliverance&lt;/i&gt; and the sheer terror of &lt;i&gt;Cape Fear&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descended from pioneer stock, the Bateses are an aristocratic Floridian family with vast holdings in real estate and mining. When matriarch Abigail Bates is discovered drowned in the Peace River, a chain of events is set into motion, embroiling Thorn with a family he never knew he had and a fortune he doesn&#39;t necessarily want. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thorn is leading a fishing expedition into the isolated lakes and mangrove swamps of Hell&#39;s Bay when Abigail&#39;s son and beautiful granddaughter arrive, claiming Thorn as a long-lost relative and asking him to solve the woman&#39;s murder. Little do they know that the killer is already on their trail. Soon their houseboat becomes a precarious island of safety in a landscape of escalating violence. What does the killer want? And why is their predator so enraged, determined to kill them all no matter what the cost? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Marilyn Stasio said in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;If violence can be poetic, Hall has the lyric voice for it.&quot;  In this tour de force of fear and suspense, Hall shows how one family&#39;s dark past comes back to haunt its most remote member---and may ultimately cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
