      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three families. Two decades. One secret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farin O&amp;rsquo;Conner wants to be a star. Jordan Grant wants the girl. Jameson Lockhardt wants to protect his empire. Simple enough, right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Music is murder.

Explore the complex lives and loves of three musical families connected by secrets one man will kill to protect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Farin O&amp;rsquo;Conner is making her dreams&amp;mdash;well, her father&amp;rsquo;s dreams&amp;mdash;come true. Driven by his memory as much as the nightmares over his mysterious death fifteen years ago, Farin is desperate to overcome her tragic childhood with a new contract, a new relationship, and a new life. Despite friends and family warning her of the pitfalls ahead, she soldiers on, determined to succeed at all costs. But will her past make demands her future can&amp;rsquo;t meet?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jordan Grant is pop music&amp;rsquo;s biggest sensation and teen heartthrob. He has the looks, the talent, and the desire for a conventional life in an unconventional profession. With a young son whose existence is omitted from his public bio, a failed relationship with Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s hottest starlet, and the pressure of his oldest brother to leave LA for good, he has difficult decisions to make. When he meets Farin, he believes he can have it all. And he does&amp;hellip;but not for long.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jameson Lockhardt, mega-mogul and career maker, has created an empire other record labels envy. An empire built on a foundation of blood, and fortified by manipulation and greed. A distant father and merciless businessman, those around him are shocked when he takes an instant&amp;mdash;if unnatural&amp;mdash;interest in Farin&amp;rsquo;s career. Under his care, Farin gets everything she ever wanted&amp;hellip;and much more than she bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will the truth set her free? Or will it change her life&amp;mdash;and everyone else&amp;rsquo;s&amp;mdash;forever?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ties That Bind&lt;/em&gt; asks, and answers, the hard questions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
