  <title>Lie Still - David Farris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A prominent physician debuts as a gifted storyteller in Lie Still, a dazzlingly suspenseful and compulsively readable trip through the dark underbelly of the OR -- where reputations, careers, and lives are on the line. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sleepy, small-town Arizona hospital, a thirteen-year-old boy lies in a coma after inexplicably suffering a cardiac arrest. His doctors are perplexed. Although emotionally disturbed Henry Rojelio was a frequent visitor to the emergency room -- often for bouts of asthma, but usually just for attention -- no one ever anticipated a battle with death. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgical resident Malcolm Ishmail began his medical career months before at a busy Phoenix hospital -- a far cry from the small ER deep in the silent heart of the desert, where Henry Rojelio lies. There, Malcolm fell into a secret, exhausting affair with one of his professors, Dr. Mimi Lyle, a beautiful, charismatic brain surgeon who had subtle difficulties in the operating room. In a moment of weakness &quot;Dreamy Mimi&quot; confessed to him her failings as a neurosurgeon; Malcolm reported her to his superiors . . . and promptly lost his job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, miles away from Phoenix, Dr. Ishmail struggles to save his young asthmatic patient&#39;s life and his future as a surgeon. And with little time and few clues to the cause of Henry Rojelio&#39;s sudden collapse, the impressionable doctor wonders whether his former lover may have exacted a disturbing revenge. Rich in medical detail and written with stylish, razor-sharp action and dialogue, Lie Still is a gripping, emotional drama of human failings and devastating consequences that marks the debut of a remarkable new voice. &lt;/p&gt;" />
