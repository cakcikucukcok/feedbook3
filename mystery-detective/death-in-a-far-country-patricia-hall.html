  <title>Death in a Far Country - Patricia Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The dark of the night. Two girls are running for their lives. Terrified, one falls and, unable to get up, she forces her friend to go on without her, to save herself. For her, there is no escape as their attackers close in... When the body of an unidentified young girl is found in the canal, DCI Thakeray is put on the case. Meanwhile, Thackeray&#39;s girlfriend, Laura Ackroyd, is reporting on the controversial appointment of a female chairman at the town&#39;s football club. It seems some people are prepared to stoop to any depths to force her out. Thackeray and Ackroyd soon suspect their two inquiries are linked, but as Laura becomes more involved in her case, does she risk putting Thackeray&#39;s job - and her life - in danger?" />
