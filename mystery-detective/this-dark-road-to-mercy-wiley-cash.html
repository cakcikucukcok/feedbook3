Since Wade signed away his legal rights, the only way he can get his daughters back is to steal them away in the night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brady Weller, the girls&#39; court-appointed guardian, begins looking for Wade, and he quickly turns up unsettling information linking Wade to a recent armored car heist, one with a whopping $14.5 million missing.

Robert Pruitt, a shady and mercurial man nursing a years-old vendetta, is also determined to find Wade and claim his due.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Narrated by a trio of alternating voices, &lt;em&gt;This Dark Road to Mercy&lt;/em&gt; is a story about the indelible power of family and the primal desire to outrun a past that refuses to let go.&lt;/p&gt;" />
