      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The irresistible, razor-sharp second book in the post-Katrina New Orleans-set crime series featuring unforgettable and gutsy reporter Nola Céspedes &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early one morning, &lt;i&gt;Times-Picayune&lt;/i&gt; crime reporter Nola Céspedes goes for her regular run in Audubon Park. More than the heat of the dawning New Orleans day, she&#39;s trying to outrun her growing unease with the man she&#39;s seeing, who is pushing her to get more serious. Instead, Nola finds herself at the scene of a crime when she discovers a dead body. Worse, Nola recognizes the victim: Judith Taffner, her former journalism professor at Tulane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not convinced Dr. Taffner&#39;s murder was the random work of a psychopath, and not one to put much trust in the good ol&#39; boys of the NOPD, Nola takes it upon herself to investigate. She discovers that Dr. Taffner was working on two explosive stories, both of which would shock even this notoriously corrupt city. And when an apparently related murder occurs in the middle of New Orleans&#39; packed Jazz Fest, Nola realizes it&#39;s only a matter of time before she becomes a ruthless killer&#39;s next target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rich with details of New Orleans and featuring an original, tough heroine as fascinating as the city itself, &lt;i&gt;Nearer Home&lt;/i&gt; is the perfect follow-up to Joy Castro&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hell or High Water&lt;/i&gt;, confirming her status as a talented new crime writer to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Exquisite New Orleans background . . . a flawed but plucky heroine, and skillfully paced suspense make this a stay up way past your bedtime read.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Booklist &lt;/i&gt;(starred)&lt;/p&gt;" />
