  <title>The Good Virus - Govind S. Mattay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Good Virus is a tale replete with humor, adventure,
science, and mystery. Through the well plotted narrative, Govind
Mattay instills a certain believability in every situation his heroes
face. No moment or action is wasted, propelling the reader towards
the climactic end.&quot;
-US Review of Books
One year after Samir Guptas mysterious disappearance,
his son Veer starts school at Medley Middle. Like many other
middle school kids, Veer is worried about bullies, being late
to class, and angry gym teachers. He did have one thing to
look forward to: winning the end-of-year Medley of Talents
competition. But little did Veer know that preparing for the
competition would lead him, his brother Jai, and his best friend
Vidya on a perilous journey.
The journey begins as the trio notices strange signs. They
see figures lurking near the house and find small surveillance
bugs implanted in their phones. Suddenly they surprisingly
overcome their greatest weaknesses and start to uncover
fascinating clues. Can their newfound strengths help them with
their search for Samir and their attempt to stop the diabolical
plan of one of the worlds most powerful corporations?" />
