  <title>Pursued by Love - Jeanne Bush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a love story, but its radically different because the love of God breaks into the novel like a whirlwind.  What is the price of such love?  Are the characters, especially one young woman, able to accept the magnificent challenge?  The plot is woven around this theme of love--human and divine with the golden thread of the gospel of St. John binding it together.  Its a story of mystery and suspense in the lives of characters who are very much like you and I.
Pursued by Love is a fascinating story which describes the path of love meant to be trod by each of us on our journey through life.  Human love and divine love are chronicled in expressive, well-written prose. The reader is captivated by descriptions of the interior life and the interaction between that and a beautiful love story, which are then wrapped in a tantalizing mystery.  A good read, I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to journey with a woman who has discovered the rich life of the interior castle.
