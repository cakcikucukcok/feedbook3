        &lt;p&gt;THE WRONG TARGET&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Trinity Miller’s attacked by a man who mistakenly believes she’s Mason Gains’s girlfriend, the reclusive prosthetic maker is forced from seclusion to rescue her. And he soon learns someone’s determined to get information on one of his clients—information they’re willing to kill for. Now the ex-army pilot has to find a way to take down the men on their trail…and make sure Trinity survives. When Trinity arrived at Mason’s isolated home to convince him to help her friend’s son, her plans didn’t include going on the run with him. But Trinity must work with Mason to outwit their pursuers…or risk losing both their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
