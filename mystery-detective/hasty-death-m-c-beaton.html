  <title>Hasty Death - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eager to join the working classes, Lady Rose Summer has abandoned the comforts of her parents&#39; home to become self-supporting. But life as a working woman isn&#39;t quite what Rose had imagined---long hours as a typist and nights spent in a dreary women&#39;s hostel are not very empowering when you&#39;re poor, cold, and tired. Luckily for Rose, her drudgery comes to a merciful end when she learns of the untimely death of an acquaintance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freddy Pomfret, a silly and vacuous young man, was almost certainly up to no good before he was shot dead in his London flat. When Rose discovers incriminating evidence pointing to several members of her class, she returns to London high society in order to investigate properly. With the help of Captain Harry Cathcart and Superintendent Kerridge of Scotland Yard, Rose prepares to do the social rounds--uncovering a devious blackmail plot and an unexpected killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in Britain during the Edwardian world of parties, servants, and scandal, M. C. Beaton&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hasty Death &lt;/i&gt;is a delightful combination of murderous intrigue and high society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
