      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s official: stumbling, bumbling James Lessor and Skip Moore are licensed private investigators. Now, that&#39;s some scary stuff.It could take time to get Moore or Less investigations off the ground, so James takes a job with a traveling carnival show.But this show has a dubious reputation, having had a string of accidents and at least one death in the past year.When they&#39;re hired to investigate what&#39;s caused the carnival chaos, James and Skip set into motion a dizzying, roller coaster chain of events.After a terrifying trip on the Dragon Tail ride, a not-so-fun dust-up in Freddy&#39;s Fun House, and a host of threats, James and Skip realize they&#39;ll get anything but cooperation from this cantankerous cast of carnies.But when a carnival worker is murdered, James and Skip will have to act fast-because they might be next in line.For James and Skip, the only thing sweeter than the smell of corndogs and fried dough will be the sweet smell of success-but in this case, success means getting out alive.This investigation is going completely off the rails." />
