  <title>Bayou Moon - C. L. Bevill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Old secrets are rising up to haunt the inhabitants of Louisiana&#39;s small, rustic St. Germaine Parish, where no one is quite who they seem, and restless spirits are rumored to roam the woods and the antebellum mansion of the town&#39;s richest family, the St. Michels. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Successful New York City artist Mignon Thibeaux doesn&#39;t believe in ghosts, but even she can&#39;t resist the rumors that the St. Michel mansion may be haunted, especially since its owner, Luc St. Michel, was the same man whom her mother ran off with 25 years ago before disappearing into thin air. Convinced that there was more to her mother&#39;s strange departure, Mignon returns to her hometown of LaValle, Louisiana to investigate. Once there, she doesn&#39;t know who she can trust - from the handsome, rugged sheriff who seems to have his own agenda, the guarded Louisiana Supreme Court judge who hides behind a wall of lies, and finally to Eleanor St. Michel, Luc&#39;s vindictive wife, who is relentless in her pursuit of the supernatural, convinced that the séances she hosts in the dead of night will appease the spirits and put an end to the hauntings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bayou Moon&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping tale of murder, revenge, and voodoo in small town Louisiana that captures all the ambience and charm of the rural South. Someone has a secret that must be kept hidden, and God help the one who tries to uncover it...&lt;/p&gt;" />
