  <title>Gone - James J. Hurley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Sean Flynn is currently out of a job.  His life has been a series of disappointments.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
And there doesnt seem to be any hope for change on the horizon.  Ten years as a narcotics agent ended in frustration and now a once promising career as a stockbroker appears destined to dissolve the same way.  Then a telephone call from Tom Morris, an old friend and former police officer, changes the course of his life forever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 At the request of Morris, Flynn agrees to help track down Marcus Lowell, a money launderer and drug dealer, in the Bahamas.  Lowell has fled the country on his $1 million bond and is setting up one last drug deal before he disappears forever.  If Flynn can locate and help bring Lowell back, hell share in the reward and be able to get back on his feet.  What Flynn and his Morris dont know is that Lowell has been assisted in his escape by the United States government. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flynn goes to the Bahamas to begin his search and meets Sydney Greyson, a beautiful banker in Nassau, and the woman of his dreams.  They begin a whirlwind romance and, during a dinner date, she introduces him to Lowell at a local restaurant.  Only Lowell is now Thomas Andrews, a wealthy customer of Sydneys bank.  In order to get close to Lowell/Andrews, Flynn agrees to go out with Lowell and his girlfriend, Amanda Blair, on his boat the next day for some diving.  During the outing, Lowell offers him a job delivering some money to a few friends in Miami for a business deal.  All he has to do is put the money in a locker at the airport, exchange the locker key for another key with one of the associates, and bring the new key back to Lowell.  Realizing that the business is drugs, Sean accepts the job, hoping to find out where Lowell is staying. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Flynn and Morris follow Lowell to his refuge on a small island and make plans to grab Lowell after a quick look at the residence.  While sneaking a look at Lowells house, Flynn and Morris are surprised by Lowell and his drug associates.  Flynn is severely wounded and forced to watch helplessly as his friend is brutally murdered by Lowell and his associates.  After a torturous escape through the islands mountainous undergrowth, Flynn vows to avenge his friends horrible death.
Flynn calls on his old narcotics partner, now an agent with the DEA, for help in setting a trap for Lowell and his associates in Miami.  He devises an operation designed to take place at the Miami airport.  Its an excellent plan except for one detail.  If he takes part in the deal, Sydney will leave him.  Shes from a different world where there is no place for violence.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Painfully wounded and enraged by the brutal murder of his friend, Sean must choose between love and revenge.  A choice he must live with the rest of his life.
