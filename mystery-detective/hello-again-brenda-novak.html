  <title>Hello Again - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestseller Brenda Novak comes the next installment of Dr. Evelyn Talbot and her murderous home for psychopaths in &lt;i&gt;Hello Again.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHE CAN MAKE SENSE OF A COMPLEX CRIMINAL MIND.&lt;br&gt; Evelyn Talbot, a psychiatrist at a maximum-security prison in Alaska, studies some of the world&#39;s worst serial killers. But she&#39;s about to meet her most elusive patient at Hanover House yet: Dr. Lyman Bishop, AKA the Zombie Maker given his fondness for performing ice-pick lobotomies on his victims. A brilliant cancer researcher, Bishop is either the most cunning psychopath Evelyn has ever encountered--or he is wrongly convicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A CRIMINAL CAN SEE INTO HER OWN?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When a new ice-pick fatality occurs, it seems Bishop really was wrongly convicted. Except...Evelyn has a personal connection to the victim and &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; suggests the killer may be someone from her own past: Jasper Moore, her high school boyfriend who tortured her and left her for dead when she was only sixteen. Jasper also murdered three of her friends--and was never caught. Is he trying to send a message with this copycat crime? The only thing Evelyn knows for sure is that if Jasper &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; on her trail, she might not be able to escape again . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
