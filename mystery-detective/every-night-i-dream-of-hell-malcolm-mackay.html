  <title>Every Night I Dream of Hell - Malcolm MACKAY</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;From the award-winning author of The Glasgow Trilogy comes &lt;i&gt;Every Night I Dream of Hell&lt;/i&gt;, a dark and thrilling Glaswegian crime drama.&lt;/b&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nate Colgan would be the first to admit that his violent reputation makes him very good at his job -- and bad at everything else. After eighteen years spent working on the sidelines of Glasgow&#39;s criminal underworld, there&#39;s no question he&#39;ll accept the central position that Peter Jamieson&#39;s organization offers him, despite his better judgment.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The organization isn&#39;t as strong as it once was: its most powerful members are either dead or behind bars, including Jamieson himself, and the time is ripe for change.  Chang begins with an execution -- a message for Jamieson&#39;s supporters -- which promptly sets the various factions within the organization against one another. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Colgan&#39;s position as &quot;security consultant&quot; means his duty is clear: identify the killer and find out who&#39;s willing to seize power, even if it means igniting a war. Meanwhile, on the other side of the law, DI Michael Fisher conduscts his own investigation into the murder. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Both men can&#39;t help but wonder: Why do these events coincide with the return of Zara Cope, the mother of Colgan&#39;s child, a disreputable woman with an uncanny ability to attract trouble and troublemakers?  A dark and thrilling crime drama, &lt;i&gt;Every Night I Dream of Hell&lt;/i&gt; takes us deep into a world of violence, fear and double-crosses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&quot;Don&#39;t pick up a Mackay book unless you&#39;ve got spare time. They&#39;re habit-forming.&quot; -- &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;" />
