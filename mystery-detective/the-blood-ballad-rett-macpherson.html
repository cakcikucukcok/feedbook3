  <title>The Blood Ballad - Rett MacPherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Genealogist and mother of three Torie O&#39;Shea is out birding on the cliffs of the Mississippi River as part of New Kassell, Missouri&#39;s first ever bird-watching Olympics, when someone starts shooting at her and her partner. Disoriented and running for their lives, they stumble over an antique trunk and discover a badly beaten dead body stuffed inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after this disturbing event, musicologist Glen Morgan shows up at the Kendall House, Torie&#39;s new textile museum, claiming to be Torie&#39;s cousin and to have proof that Torie&#39;s grandfather secretly may have written a number of popular songs for the Morgan Family Players, who were famous country music singers. Being a genealogist and the head of the local historical society, Torie doesn&#39;t appreciate anyone shaking up a family tree that she has spent years putting together, but Glen&#39;s old recordings are more than she can resist. After a little digging in the library and some serious snooping into the shooting, Torie starts to uncover secrets about her family and the town that even she didn&#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rett MacPherson&#39;s intricate plots and delightful small-town characters with long family histories hit all of the right notes in &lt;i&gt;The Blood Ballad,&lt;/i&gt; the newest installment in her terrific Torie O&#39;Shea series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
