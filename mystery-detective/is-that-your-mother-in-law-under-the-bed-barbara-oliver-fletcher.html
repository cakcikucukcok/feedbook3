  <title>Is That Your Mother-In-Law Under the Bed? - Barbara Oliver Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Edna Barnes and Edith Johnson are sisters and widows in their late fifties who enjoy quiet lives together in a double-wide mobile home in a pleasant mobile home park. Things are pretty peaceful for the pairuntil Ednas daughter Ellen shows up, suspicious that her husband of seven years, Roger, is cheating on her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edna and Edith jump into action to find out the truth about Roger and his supposed mistress. Edna uses common sense, while Edith relies on her son the police officer as an inside connection. What began as the case of a cheating husband, though, soon turns into the search for a murderer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When greed, sex, and heartbreak get involved, anything can happen, and Edna and Edith know this all too well. Their initial investigations into Roger turn up evidence that could solve three cold casesand theyre discovering that the adrenaline rush of solving crimes is much more enjoyable than daytime television, bingo, and quilting parties. &lt;/p&gt;" />
