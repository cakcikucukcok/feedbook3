  <title>Agatha Raisin and the Terrible Tourist - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Agatha Raisin and the Terrible Tourist &lt;/i&gt;continues the tradition in M. C. Beaton&#39;s beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series--now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agatha Raisin&#39;s marriage was put off when her ex-husband showed up, unfortunately alive. Fortunately, he was murdered and Agatha solved the crime. Now she is off to Cyprus to track down her ex-fiance. Instead of enjoying their planned honeymoon, however, they witness the murder of an obnoxious tourist. Two sets of terrible tourists surround the unhappy couple, arousing Agatha&#39;s suspicions. And, much to James&#39; chagrin, she won&#39;t rest until she finds the killer. Unfortunately, it seems the killer also won&#39;t rest until Agatha is out of the picture. Agatha is forced to track down the murderer, try to rekindle her romance with James, and fend off a suave baronet, all while coping with the fact that it&#39;s always bathing suit season in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;" />
