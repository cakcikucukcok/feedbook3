  <title>Entangled Moon - E.C. Frey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="• According to Pew Research Center, multiracial Americans are the cutting edge of social and demographic change in the US. Growing at a rate three times as fast as the population as a whole, they are defining change. The survey found that 2.1% of the adult population is multiracial, but that may be understated. Pew estimates it is closer to 6.9%.
• Mysteries/thrillers remain wildly popular: 57% of women read books in the mystery/thriller/crime category, along with 39% of men, in 2016.
• Water is the resource over which access is potentially most contentious; recently, the conflict over water rights at Standing Rock has created widespread interest in this issue, in the US and worldwide.
• The US Census Bureau finds that in 2013, about 9 million Americans chose two or more racial categories when asked about their race.
AUDIENCE: 
• Biracial and multiracial 
• People interested in water rights, resource allocation, and sustainability
• People interested in coming-of-age stories set in the 1960s
• Women 18–70
• People who love suspense/thrillers" />
