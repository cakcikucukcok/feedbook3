  <title>The Fellowship of the Mystery of God - David H. Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written for inquiring minds that
really want to know the truth of who Jesus is, why
he came to earth nearly 2000 years ago, and why he
is returning to earth very soon.
During the first forty years of David Thompsons
walk as a professed Born Again Christian, he
believed the traditional answers proclaimed by the
Church that said Jesus came to earth to die for our
sins so we could go to heaven when we died in the
sweet bye and bye.
However, for the past seven years, God has
called David and many others into a closer, more
spiritual walk in which God the Father has clearly
revealed that the primary mission of His Son
Jesus and His saints is to proclaim and promote
God s Great Kingdom on earth in the sweet here
and now!
Jesus said the coming of God s Kingdom to
earth is a Mystery. He exclusively revealed this
Mystery to his 12 disciples in his interpretation of
his Parable of the Sower.
St. Paul speaks of the Fellowship of this Mystery as
he describes his God-given ministry to the Gentiles,
to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the
Mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath
been hid in God. Ephesians 3: 6-12" />
