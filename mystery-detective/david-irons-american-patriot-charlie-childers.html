  <title>David Irons American Patriot - Charlie Childers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David Irons was graduating first in his class at Texas A&amp;M University, but though he was a brilliant student his real love at the college was football. His graduating placement meant less to him in the face of his disappointment at not being good enough to go on to play football for the Dallas Cowboys, but he was left with what was, to him, a lesser alternative: go to medical school and join his father&#39;s practice as an orthopedic surgeon.
That was before a strange incident in the mountains of Colorado changed his physical make-up and abilities. When his friend, Scot Morgan of the Cowboys, saw him run, he immediately arranged a tryout. David ended up with his original dream, playing for the Cowboys and becoming the MVP of the National Football League in his first and only year.
Things changed again when he rescued the wife of Joseph Ordway, a prominent industrialist, from kidnappers who had hoped to gain some of his large wealth for themselves. This led to David&quot;s meeting with Joseph himself, who happened to be the owner of Ordway Enterprises, the world&#39;s largest armament manufacturer. Ordway, knowing what he did of David&#39;s abilities, persuaded his close friend, Admiral Bonner of the National Security Agency to recruit David and make him an undercover agent to lead the fight against global terrorism.
David&#39;s first mission would prove to have not only national interests but personal ones at stake; he was to rescue his new bride, Carrie, who had been abducted during their honeymoon in Puerto Vallarta. The culprit? The internationally sought-after terrorist and drug kingpin, Ramon Estebon. David desperately trailed Estebon through the jungles of Columbia, but his path was bereft of a happy ending. He found his beloved wife dying from a drug overdose forced on her by the cartel. This senseless murder sent David into a rage, placing within him an ever-burning hatred directed at Estebon and men like him.
David&#39;s passion drives him to seek out and destroy terrorists who plot against America, its resources, and most importantly its people. His love for his wife joins his love for his country in his campaign for conservative ideals and against growing socialist trends in government as he does everything possible to prevent others from suffering the fate of his wife and others like her that have fallen to America&#39;s enemies. He carries out covert operations across the globe; Columbia, Turkey, Syria, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and the U. S. David is determined to make it so there is no place where the enemies of Democracy are safe from his staunch defense of his country." />
