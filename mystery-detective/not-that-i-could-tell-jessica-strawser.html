  <title>Not That I Could Tell - Jessica Strawser</title>

It&#39;s a rare kid-free night, and they&#39;re giddy with it. They drink too much, and the conversation turns personal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; By Monday morning, one of them is gone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Everyone knows something about everyone else in the quirky small Ohio town of Yellow Springs, but no one can make sense of the disappearance. Kristin was a sociable twin mom, college administrator, and doctor&#39;s wife who didn&#39;t seem all that bothered by her impending divorce--and the investigation turns up more questions than answers, with her husband, Paul, at the center. For her closest neighbor, Clara, the incident triggers memories she thought she&#39;d put behind her--and when she&#39;s unable to extract herself from the widening circle of scrutiny, her own suspicions quickly grow. But the neighborhood&#39;s newest addition, Izzy, is determined not to jump to any conclusions--especially since she&#39;s dealing with a crisis of her own.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As the police investigation goes from a media circus to a cold case, the neighbors are forced to reexamine what&#39;s going on behind their own closed doors--and to ask how well anyone &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; knows anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;" />
