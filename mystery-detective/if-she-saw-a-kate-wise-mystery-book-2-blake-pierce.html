  <title>If She Saw (A Kate Wise Mystery—Book 2) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“A masterpiece of thriller and mystery. Blake Pierce did a magnificent job developing characters with a psychological side so well described that we feel inside their minds, follow their fears and cheer for their success. Full of twists, this book will keep you awake until the turn of the last page.” 
--Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos (re Once Gone) 
IF SHE SAW (A Kate Wise Mystery) is book #2 in a new psychological thriller series by bestselling author Blake Pierce, whose #1 bestseller Once Gone (Book #1) (a free download) has received over 1,000 five star reviews. 
When a couple is found murdered and no suspects are apparent, 55 year old empty nester Kate Wise, after a 30 year career with the FBI, finds herself called out of retirement (and her quiet suburban life) to come back and work for the bureau. 
Kate’s brilliant mind and unrivaled ability to enter the mind of serial killers is just too indispensable, and the FBI needs her to crack this baffling case. Why were two couples found murdered, 50 miles apart, and in the same manner? What can they possibly have in common? 
The answer, Kate realizes, is urgent—as she is certain the killer is about to strike again.
But in the deadly game of cat and mouse that follows, Kate, entering the dark canals of the killer’s twisted mind, may just find herself a moment too late.
An action-packed thriller with heart-pounding suspense, IF SHE SAW is book #2 in a riveting new series that will leave you turning pages late into the night. 
Book #3 in the KATE WISE MYSTERY series is now also available for pre-order.
