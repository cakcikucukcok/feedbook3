  <title>Ginger Snapped - Gail Oust</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Murder comes well-seasoned in &lt;i&gt;Ginger Snapped&lt;/i&gt;, Gail Oust&#39;s newest novel in the charming, &quot;must-read&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;) Spice Shop mystery series.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piper Prescott and Police Chief Wyatt McBride might have gotten off on the wrong foot but, over the past year, their interactions have evolved into a friendship of sorts. And when the body of Shirley Randolph is found floating in a fishing hole, their relationship reaches entirely new territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shirley, the town&#39;s Realtor of the Year, was also Wyatt&#39;s suspected romantic interest, and now the residents of Brandywine Creek are speculating that Wyatt is responsible for her death. As the town council moves to suspend the handsome lawman, Piper springs into action to save his reputation and possibly his freedom. She enlists the aid of her BFF, Reba Mae Johnson, along with Wyatt himself, to help solve the puzzle and find Shirley&#39;s real killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pointing them toward high-powered real estate tactics and possible affairs, the investigation soon becomes personal when Piper&#39;s shop, Spice It Up!, is burglarized, and she&#39;s forced off the road late one night, narrowly escaping serious injury. Realizing that she must be close to uncovering the truth, and that the evidence against Wyatt is no longer circumstantial, Piper resorts to drastic measures to prevent a grave miscarriage of justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
