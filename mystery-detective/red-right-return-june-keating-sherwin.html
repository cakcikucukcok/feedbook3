  <title>Red, Right, Return - June Keating Sherwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eleven-year-old Chad Hatcher was only trying to get proof. No one would believe him without it. He&#39;d spotted some men hauling suspicious looking rocks off a reef near his house in the Florida Keys, and he suspected that the shiny bits of metal embedded in the rocks were pieces of treasure from an ancient shipwreck site. It couldn&#39;t be a legal dive site; not that close to a protected reef.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming up with a plan to stop the looters before they destroy the reef is simple . . . finding a way to get past his big sister, Georgene, is not. Then when things suddenly go wrong, Chad, and his sister, must scramble for their lives through the backwaters of Sugarloaf Key--with no one to turn to but each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A perfect summer thriller for young readers.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
                                Kirkus Reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;There&#39;s plenty here to entertain young readers, and their&lt;br&gt;
adult friends.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
