She shares her culinary love as a recipe columnist for the local paper&amp;#8212;until &lt;em&gt;The Gazette&lt;/em&gt; decides its readers are hungrier for advice on matters of the heart rather than ideas for lunch and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tannie Maria doesn&amp;#8217;t like the change, but soon discovers she has a knack&amp;#8212;and a passion&amp;#8212;for helping people. Of course she shares her recipes and culinary advice whenever she can! Assisting other people with their problems, Tannie Maria is eventually forced to face her own issues, especially when the troubles of those she helps touch on the pain of her past, like a woman desperate to escape her abusive husband.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the woman is murdered, Tannie Maria becomes dangerously entwined in the investigation, despite the best efforts of one striking detective determined to keep her safe. Suddenly, this practical, down-to-earth woman is involved in something much more sinister than perfecting her chocolate cake recipe . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
