  <title>Slow Bullet - John L. Lansdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;page-turner...Those who like their thrillers with a heavy dose of violent action will be satisfied.&amp;quot; - Publishers Weekly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &amp;quot;straight-ahead thriller...it&amp;#39;s about action, and there&amp;#39;s plenty of that. Check it out.&amp;quot; - Bill Crider&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Washington cover-ups. Crooked CIA operatives. International intrigue.&lt;br /&gt;
McKay wants to find a murderer. But what happens when he uncovers so much more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this timely novel, veteran Clark McKay is haunted by the loss of his wife and son, and nightmares of his time in Vietnam have been keeping the former U.S. Army Special Forces colonel up at night.&lt;br /&gt;
Trying to drown his problems in a bottle only makes his body and the mirror remind him he&amp;#39;s not getting any younger.&lt;br /&gt;
After hearing terrible news about the murder of a close friend he served with in the war, McKay is determined to rise above his own problems and find the killer.&lt;br /&gt;
No matter the cost.&lt;br /&gt;
This search for truth takes McKay across the globe, where he crosses paths with a multitude of unforgettable characters with mixed motives.&lt;br /&gt;
Along the way, it becomes increasingly clear to McKay that his friend was murdered for uncovering the truth behind one of the nation&amp;#39;s most notorious conspiracies &amp;ndash; the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.&lt;br /&gt;
After wallowing in a murky ocean of corruption, McKay is brought to the conclusion he may have to resort to murder if justice is to be truly served.&lt;br /&gt;
Truth and fiction make for an interesting mixture in this fast-paced and entertaining novel.&lt;br /&gt;
There are always those who escape justice, and one hand will always wash the other.&lt;br /&gt;
Unless you have someone like Clark McKay willing to pay the ultimate price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;###&lt;/p&gt;
