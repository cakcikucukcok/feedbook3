  <title>Lessons by the Lake - Debora J. McGill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Oliver, a prominent resident of the small tourist town of Lake Side collapses from a heart attack and is taken to Mercy Hospital, the regular patrons of Jays Barber Shop react to the news by flipping coins to see who among them will visit their long-time friend. Events unfold quickly, initially taking an equally tragic turn when Rico and Dillon get into an automobile accident on their way to visit Oliver. After all three men are admitted to the very busy hospital, they discover they are patients assigned to the same room. One coincidence after another occurs; or is it coincidence? Is God in control of lifes events, or allowing them? Who is the woman whose kindness toward Dillon and his neighbors turns his obsession with her into good news for himself and his wife Gretta? How do the attitudes of the barber shop patrons change? Lessons By the Lake is a story about divine love, forgiveness and compassion. A few small acts of kindness, culminate with many lives having been transformed for the better.&lt;/p&gt;" />
