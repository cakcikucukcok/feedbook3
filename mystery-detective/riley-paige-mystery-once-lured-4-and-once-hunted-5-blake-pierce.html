  <title>Riley Paige Mystery: Once Lured (#4) and Once Hunted (#5) - Blake Pierce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A bundle of books #4 (ONCE LURED) and #5 (ONCE HUNTED) in Blake Pierce&#39;s Riley Paige Mystery series-which begins with ONCE GONE, a #1 bestseller with over 350 five star reviews-and a free download! This bundle offers books #4 and #5 in one convenient file, with over 150,000 words of reading.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ONCE LURED, the FBI, desperate to crack the case, urges Special Agent Riley Paige to take it on. But the brilliant Riley, still reeling from past cases, has finally found peace in her home life, and is determined to help her daughter April get back on her feet. Yet when the murders become too disturbing, too urgent-and when her former partner Bill implores her-Riley finally realizes she can&#39;t say no. Riley&#39;s hunt leads her deep into the unsettling world of hitchhikers, of drifters, of women that no one else cares for. When she discovers that several women are being kept alive and that there is still time to save them, she realizes she will stop at nothing, obsessing over the case and driving herself to the brink.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In ONCE HUNTED, Special Agent Riley Paige&#39;s worst nightmare has come true: a serial killer she put away years ago is loose. And his main target is her. Riley is used to being the one hunting, but for the first time, she finds herself-and her family-to be the ones being hunted. As the killer stalks her, he also begins a new rampage of kills, and Riley must stop him before it is too late-for the other victims, and for herself. But this is no ordinary killer. He is too smart, and their game of cat-and-mouse too twisted, and he somehow manages to elude her and always stay one step ahead.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark psychological thrillers with heart-pounding suspense, the Riley Paige mysteries are a riveting new series-with a beloved new character-that will leave you turning pages late into the night." />
