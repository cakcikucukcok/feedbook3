  <title>Downtown Browns - Khalil Baaqi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the most terrifying urban tale since the original motion picture, Candyman.
Kenny Robbins, Author of Nobodys Hostage
The Lomax Brown projects in D-Town are experiencing a preponderance of brutal murders. Human carcasses and the dismembered remains of men of all ages are being found throughout the twin cities largest urban housing development, and in various locations on the citys eastside. Discovered in dumpsters, in alleyways, and within the units of the horde of massive buildings that comprise the infamous projects are the remnants of fathers, sons, grandsons, and husbands, deprived of their heads, genitals, and entrails by a mysterious and unseen evil that would come to be known as the eastside ripper. The killings began a month after the death of Lorenzo Ren Hickem, a long-term and well known resident of the Browns who was savagely murdered while soliciting the services of an A-Town prostitute on A-Towns notorious Nile Ave. After the killings had begun, rumors immediately began to circulate throughout the community about the late Rens vengeful revenant being the culprit, considering that very few if any believed that a normal person could be responsible for these deeds because of the brutal and heinous nature of the killings. And as the body count continues to pile up, the residents of the Browns and inhabitants of the entire eastside community find themselves on the perils of familial and communal collapse because of the mass hysteria that inevitably ensued. Unsurprisingly, the initial questions of who or what could it be? burgeoned into the portentous and foreboding who will be next?" />
