  <title>Survivors Will Be Shot Again - Bill Crider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no such thing as a day off for a sheriff. Even in a small Texas town like Clearview, there&#39;s always something going on for law enforcement. Still, most days don&#39;t involve a run-in with an alligator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s not the worst of Sheriff Dan Rhodes&#39;s troubles, either. There&#39;s a dead man in Billy Bacon&#39;s barn, though Bacon swears he doesn&#39;t know how the body got there. Rhodes is a bit skeptical, given that the intruder has been shot twice and that Bacon has recently removed a sign from a fencepost near the barn, a sign that says &quot;Trespassers will be shot. Survivors will be shot again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The citizens of Clearview have been complaining about a rash of thefts, and Rhodes suspects that the dead man may have been involved in them. But before he can solve that crime, he also has to deal with a number of other puzzling crimes in the community, ranging from a holdup at a convenience store to the disappearance of a loaf of bread. And then there&#39;s the dang gator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Bill Crider&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Survivors Will Be Shot Again&lt;/i&gt;, Sheriff Dan Rhodes learns that, as the old saying goes, crime doesn&#39;t pay. But it also doesn&#39;t take a vacation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
