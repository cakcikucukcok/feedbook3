  <title>Sleep Like the Dead - Alex Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a hitman in Glasgow: unpaid and angry, he&amp;#8217;s decided to settle his own debts&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marianne Brogan can&amp;#8217;t sleep. She&amp;#8217;s plagued by a nightmare: someone in the shadows, whispering threats, stalking her every move. To make matters worse, Marianne can&amp;#8217;t get hold of her brother, Billy. Despite knowing some shady characters from Glasgow&amp;#8217;s underworld, Billy&amp;#8217;s always been there for her &amp;#8211; until now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, DCI Lorimer and his team are faced with a string of seemingly unconnected but professional killings. Without witnesses or much conclusive evidence to build a case, the officers are drawing a blank. Criminal psychologist Solly Brightman is off the case due to budget cuts. But Solly is more closely connected to the murders than he could possibly know . . . And as the hitman plans a bloody ransom to get his fee, the race is on to find out just who hired him &amp;#8211; and who&amp;#8217;s next on the hit list.&lt;/p&gt;" />
