Before Matt Jacob became a private detective, he was a social worker in The End--home to Boston&#39;s hopeless and helpless. When a ragged figure from his past shows up, Matt winds up back in the Combat Zone--but this time, his chances of getting out again are much slimmer. Now Matt faces demons from his past as well as a psychopath bent on killing him when he investigates two ominously similar deaths occurring twenty years apart. Matt disturbs more than one ghost as he spirals down a path of drugs, sex, and violence into the mysteries of his own past.&lt;/div&gt;" />
