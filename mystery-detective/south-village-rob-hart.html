  <title>South Village - Rob Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Ash McKenna used to be an amateur P.I.&amp;#151;emphasis on &amp;#145;amateur&amp;#8217;. Despite good intentions, he made a mess of his life in New York, so tried to build a new one in Portland. But after a traumatic turn of events, he ends up on a commune in the Georgia woods, binge-drinking cheap whiskey and waiting for his passport to flee the country and nightmares that have followed him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then a man is found dead. Known only as &amp;#145;Crusty Pete&amp;#8217;, the commune dweller is sprawled in the dirt, having fallen from a high rope bridge. It&amp;#8217;s written off as an accident, but Ash suspects something more sinister. As he looks into Pete&amp;#8217;s death, Ash is shocked to find the supposedly peaceful community houses a rogue faction preparing to commit an unspeakable act of violence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ash has to make a choice: run, or put his skills to use and try to stop them. But he doesn&amp;#8217;t know who to trust, or where the faction is planning to strike. As he struggles to put a stop to the violence, while keeping his own demons at bay, Ash finds that it&amp;#8217;s only a matter of time before one or the other puts him down for good.&lt;/div&gt;" />
