  <title>The Detective &amp; the Chinese High-Fin - Michael Craven</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finalist for the 2017 Shamus Award&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Craven, author of&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Detective &amp;#38; The Pipe Girl&lt;/em&gt;, delivers another mystery&amp;#8212;for fans of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen&amp;#8212;featuring private detective John Darvelle, who must crack a cold case that pulls him into the high-stakes world of exotic fish collectors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private Detective John Darvelle is back&amp;#8212;drinking cheap beer, playing ping-pong and sharing his philosophy on everything from work/life balance to restaurants with bad air-conditioning. (He doesn&amp;#8217;t believe in the former, he despises the latter.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Darvelle is hired to find the killer of Keaton Fuller, a well-born Los Angeles man gunned down in his own driveway. The cops couldn&amp;#8217;t solve the case, in part because everyone who came in contact with Keaton despised him. Translation: Anybody could have done it. Following a trail of the dead man&amp;#8217;s betrayals, Darvelle finds himself in the exotic, high-stakes world of rare tropical fish. The fish are certainly valuable enough to kill for, but is there something more menacing going on?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Darvelle relentlessly drives toward the truth, a showdown awaits that is at once riveting, visceral, and very, very dangerous. It&amp;#8217;s a case only he could solve&amp;#8212;just as long as he&amp;#8217;s willing to put his life on the line.&lt;/p&gt;" />
