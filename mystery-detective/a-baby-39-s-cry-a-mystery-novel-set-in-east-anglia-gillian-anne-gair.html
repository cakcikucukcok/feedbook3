  <title>A Baby&#39;s Cry: A Mystery Novel Set in East Anglia - Gillian Anne Gair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Seeking a quieter and safer environment for their baby, Anna and Joe, move into a cottage in a small village in Suffolk. One day, Joe loses patience with Anna and accuses her of being overprotective towards the baby - words that come back to haunt him later that day when Ben disappears from his pram. The story then follows Anna and Joe&#39;s emotional journey as the police search for Baby Ben. As the weeks pass, and no trace of Ben is found, Anna pulls herself out of her apathy and despair and sets about trying to find him herself with the help of a washed-up, alcoholic reporter, who left a card with the enigmatic message scribbled on the back: - &#39;I can help you find your son&#39;.   &#39;A Baby&#39;s Cry&#39; examines the effects on Anna and Joe, and the rollercoaster ride of emotions they suffer; while also tracing their relationship, as they both deal with the tragedy in different ways. The close, strong relationship they had previously shared suffers under the strain, and neither is sure life will ever be the same again." />
