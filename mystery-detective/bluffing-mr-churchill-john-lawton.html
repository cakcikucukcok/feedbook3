  <title>Bluffing Mr. Churchill - John Lawton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;With his Inspector Troy series, John Lawton has been compared to top historical espionage writers such as John le Carre and Len Deighton. Brilliantly re-creating London in the time of ration tickets and bread lines, Bluffing Mr. Churchill is a blistering page-turner. It is 1941. Wolfgang Stahl, an American spy operating undercover as an SS officer, has just fled Germany with Hitler&#39;s henchmen on his trail. Stahl&#39;s man in the American embassy, the shy and sheltered Calvin M. Cormack, is teamed with a boisterous MI5 officer, Walter Stilton, to find the spy and bring him to safety. Their investigation takes them across war-torn London, and in Cormack&#39;s case, into the arms of Kitty, his partner&#39;s rambunctious daughter. As Cormack and Stilton close in on Stahl, bodies begin turning up &amp;#151; and the duo realize they may not be the only ones in pursuit of the spy. When his partner is suddenly murdered, Cormack must turn to the ingenious devices of his lover Kitty&#39;s old flame &amp;#151; Sergeant Troy of Scotland Yard. Together, they investigate the trail of murders and come to a horrifying realization &amp;#151; are Cormack and his spy being played by one of their own in the American embassy?&lt;/div&gt;" />
