  <title>The Whyte Hinde - Lizzy Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a tale of the dark places of the soul, where unrequited passion and desire lead the unprotected into the deep roots of our psyche and myth and magic become one with our minds. 
A young woman stumbles upon an ancient manor house and becomes entangled with a handsome but cold man. Her obsession begins a journey that leads her into a murder mystery when she discovers the previous elderly owner of the house was found naked and dead in the woods under mysterious circumstances. 
She then starts a chilling descent into the dark places of the mind that eventually costs her her very soul. Her love unrequited, she is driven by lust to search deeper into the past to discover that only the ultimate conquest can satisfy her needs. 
Is she psychic or is the house truly controlling her behaviour? Or is she becoming mentally unstable, being increasingly solitary and separated from her previous mundane lifestyle? Dare you follow her fearful path into the unknown?" />
