  <title>An Uncertain Suicide - A.P. Greenwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Three hours after a prominent Houston philanthropist is murdered, a mysterious man leaps into the murky gulf waters from a fishing pier in Galveston, Texas, disappearing in front of six stunned witnesses. Rhett Sanders, by random chance, had met the apparent suicide victim just weeks before, and his experience in market research tells him that something doesn’t make sense. He enlists the help of his girlfriend, Toni, and his best friend and criminal attorney, Chris Beck, to investigate these deadly incidents. They uncover a connection between the suicide victim, the murdered philanthropist, and a doctor with a taste for killing. But more dangerous is the threat presented by an ex Navy SEAL, who has more than a taste for killing—he has the experience. Includes Readers Guide." />
