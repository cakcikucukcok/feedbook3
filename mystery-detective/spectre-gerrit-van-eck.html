      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carson Mathews is a young man who has lived his entire life as a nobody. He drifts from day to day, living an existence that has no meaning or importance, spending most of his time playing video games and watching movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One night on the way home from a bar, he is approached by a man who informs him he has been chosen to protect the world. The man is a Guardian, one of a mystic race of beings who keep the universe in balance. The Guardians take Carson to a parallel world run by gangs in which democracy and liberty do not exist. They tell him he needs to prevent an impending disaster that could affect both universes. There, a man named Spectre threatens to kill thousands of people for his own personal gain. Left on his own in this new world and having no combat experience, Carson joins a local gang, who begin training him in the ways of their world. But can he learn quickly enough to survive and to save both this world and his own?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this science fiction novel, a young man trapped in a parallel universe must rely on his inner strength and his new gang family to protect two worlds from destruction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
