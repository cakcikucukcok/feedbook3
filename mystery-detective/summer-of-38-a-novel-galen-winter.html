  <title>Summer of 38: A Novel - Galen Winter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1938, the year before the world exploded into six years of war, eight people boarded a Caribbean freighter for a cruise to the Republic of Anchuria. They were beginning to see signs of a recovery from the Great Depression and gave little thought to the dark storms approaching them from Europe. Most of them were unaware of the Anchurian President&#39;s attempts to establish an alliance with Hitler&#39;s Third Reich. Most of them were unaware of those among their travel companions who promoted the Nazi cause. Most of them were unaware of those among their travel companions who fought against it. Most of them were unaware of the intrigue and murder and the plans of violence surrounding them. The ones who were unaware enjoyed their experience.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Galen Winter is a retired (he says &quot;reformed&quot;) attorney. He lived in Mexico and in Puerto Rico, traveling extensively in South America, Central America and the Caribbean while negotiating and managing contracts between United States corporations and Latin companies and governments. He became a Consultant in International affairs, then a domestic corporation attorney and finished his professional career as a private practitioner in a small upper Wisconsin town where, he says &quot;a man can associate with dogs and shotguns without arousing too much suspicion.&quot; For nearly three decades he wrote back-page humor columns for national and regional outdoor sports magazines and has hunted and fished all over the hemisphere. Other books by Galen Winter include: &lt;i&gt;The Aegis Conspiracy, The Chronicles of Major Peabody, The Journals of Major Peabody, The Best of the Major, Backlash&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; Backlash II&lt;/i&gt;." />
