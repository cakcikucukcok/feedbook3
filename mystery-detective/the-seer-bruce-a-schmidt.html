  <title>The Seer - Bruce A. Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kevin knew he was a great Detective and he had worked hard to get out of the senseless crimes and ruthless and in-humane deaths of the California glamour and bright lights. After watching the bad that was brought out in the very soul of even the purest person, he started to lose his edge, his cases became more and more senseless in their nature; but Kevin hears the victims even in death and tries to help them, tries to solve their crimes so they can get justice. With the cases in California getting harder and harder to even understand in the very manor of which they were brutally committed and a bad divorce he moves back to a small town to regain his sharpness and wit as a Detective. The small town offers Kevin the calm and peaceful environment he needs to recalibrate his senses, become sharper at what he knows best; being a good Detective and crime scene investigator. Kevin starts to experience an element he hadnt planned on and he is now forced to add in a new and mysterious factor into the already horrible and unfortunate profession of Detective and crime scene investigation. Just prior to Kevins arrival in the small town crime and tragedy double almost overnight! Can Kevin take advantage of the small town and the pure nature of the town and solve the crimes that have exploded in number? Can Kevins wit and skill as a Detective help the victims of the small town get their justice, can Kevin use this new factor he has just come to know to his advantage or will it be his undoing? Kevin sets forth with the small town police department to get the victims their justice, but will he have enough time, is it too late already?" />
