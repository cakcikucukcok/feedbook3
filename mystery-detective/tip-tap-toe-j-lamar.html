  <title>Tip Tap Toe - J. Lamar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sergeant James Douglas and his partner are investigating the murder of a security guard at the Laverty Farm Equipment Company that occurred during an apparent robbery. As the investigation unfolds, it is apparent that the motive for his death is more than robbery. Soon, the detectives have reason to believe that other murders may be related to the same killer and this might only be the beginning.
The investigation takes them to Cincinnati, Ohio where the murder of an honorable man occurs soon after they arrive. The murderer, now classified as a serial killer, is on a rampage. He has a knack for tracking and terrorizing his victims before he moves in for the kill. He is able to conceal himself and at first appears to be a crazed psychopath, but this monster has the cunning and strength of a wild animal.
It is up to Sergeant Douglas to find out what has set this beast loose and how to bring him to justice." />
