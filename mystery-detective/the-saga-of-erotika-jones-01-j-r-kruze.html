  <title>The Saga of Erotika Jones 01 - J. R. Kruze</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The body disappeared, the witnesses forgot their stories.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;And I had 24 hours to solve the mystery before all the evidence vanished.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had no memory of how this all started. Only that I was brought in to solve a mystery in a single day before I had to move to my next assignment. Because I&amp;#39;m a time-jumper. And I go where I&amp;#39;m sent.&lt;br /&gt;
Because I&amp;#39;m damned good at figuring things out. You don&amp;#39;t have to have a string of degrees behind your name to figure out things.&lt;br /&gt;
The trick is, I &amp;quot;borrow&amp;quot; someone else&amp;#39;s body while I&amp;#39;m on the job, for the time I&amp;#39;m here.&lt;br /&gt;
All I know on this job had a missing corpse already. And it happened when no one was around to see, on a government naval base in the heart of New York. Where sub-contractors came and went constantly.&lt;br /&gt;
I just had to solve it faster than the witnesses either &amp;quot;forgot&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;disappeared.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Like I said, I had only 24 hours.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t want to get out of bed for this new case. I felt tired, the bed was warm, and there was this hunk beside me. Broad shoulders, firm bum, sculptured abs &amp;ndash; everything a gal could want.&lt;br /&gt;
Still, the phone was vibrating, it&amp;#39;s staccato tempo on the side table persistent and annoying.&lt;br /&gt;
I had my job to do. And under 24 hours, as usual, to see if I could solve this one.&lt;br /&gt;
So I picked that annoyance up and saw the texts that had come in for me. On her phone. My host&amp;#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;
That was the trick - I &amp;quot;borrowed&amp;quot; someone&amp;#39;s body and ID for the cases that came in. How they did it, the nuts-and-bolts, I didn&amp;#39;t really know. Nor did I know my own past - any more. Too many of these jumps had kinda swiss-cheesed my memories.&lt;br /&gt;
The texts were all from Sy (or &amp;quot;Finn&amp;quot;, as he sometimes referred to himself). Direct descendant from the Irish Old Ones, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Aos Si&lt;/i&gt;. And sometimes he said he was descended from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Menehune&lt;/i&gt;. It just depended which side of the planet we ended up on. He was my partner, my bar-buddy, and somehow was connected to the reason I still did this. Still, he made it interesting, and cheered me up when things got too solid and graphic.&lt;br /&gt;
This morning he&amp;#39;d texted me the body was already missing, already cleaned. Said I needed to get there quick, since we both knew the reasons - the witnesses would be &amp;quot;forgetting&amp;quot; what they saw nearly as quick.&lt;br /&gt;
Sy had a theory, and it was closer to true than anyone else believed &amp;ndash; other than we who lived in the strange worlds where humans and fairies crossed paths, and where we fought the hidden wars to keep humans safe - in spite of themselves. The darker half of the faery kind were organizing for something - and these human bodies showing up and disappearing were just collateral evidence of their larger plan.&lt;br /&gt;
Somehow. Having a working theory, anyway, was better than having none.&lt;br /&gt;
My feet on the floor now, I bent to scoop up my underthings and found a too-short cotton bathrobe lay tangled in them. Slipping that on gave me some relative decency.&lt;br /&gt;
A few steps further found a couple of pair of pants on the floor, also tangled. Another quick bend and I snagged them both as well, all enroute to my bathroom. Looked like some ID were in them, so I could get some details about who I was and where...&lt;br /&gt;
