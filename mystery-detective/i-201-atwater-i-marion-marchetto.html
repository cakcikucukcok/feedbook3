  <title>&lt;I&gt;201 Atwater&lt;/I&gt; - Marion Marchetto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Max Milionas inherits his parents&#39; house at 201 Atwater Street in New Haven, Connecticut, he is determined to sell it as soon as possible. However, he quickly discovers that the residence has a history that it is begging to tell.
With the house itself as narrator, author Marion Marchetto weaves an enchanting tale set in one of New Haven&#39;s most historic districts. Max and his wife Edwina begin their research into the background of the old house at the town clerk&#39;s office and the extensive libraries of Yale University. They soon uncover clues that lead them through a series of secrets hidden for the past two hundred years. Max and Edwina team up with Merline Madagascar, an interior designer who specializes in historical restorations, but who also possesses the innate ability to actually communicate with old buildings. Working together, they are able to lovingly restore the house to its original, beautiful condition-and finally free its untold secrets.
Does the house&#39;s history hold a promise for the twenty-first century? The key to unlocking a fifty-five-year-old mystery may prove that history sometimes comes full circle, welcoming everyone home again." />
