  <title>Hook, Line, and Homicide - Mark Richard Zubro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Since when are vacations ever relaxing? All Chicago police Detective Paul Turner is hoping for on his annual retreat from the city and his job is a little peace and quiet. This time he&#39;s headed to the Canadian Great North Woods for a couple of weeks with family and friends -- his two teenaged sons, his lover Ben, neighborhood pals, and his long-term police partner, Detective Buck Fenwick, along with his wife. &lt;br&gt;But hopes of tranquility are soon crushed when Turner intervenes in a scuffle between a group of First Nations teens and a local bully and his cohorts. In the days following the incident, Turner and company find themselves the object of a series of attacks, break-ins, and sabotage of their equipment. Unable to get the attention of the local police, the events continue to escalate, culminating in the local bully&#39;s dead body being found floating in the water near the dock of their houseboat. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mark Richard Zubro&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hook, Line, and Homicide&lt;/i&gt;, things are turning out to be not only one of the least relaxing vacations ever, but one of the deadliest.&lt;/p&gt;" />
