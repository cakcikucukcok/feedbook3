  <title>The Bottomless Pit - Jon Gee Ruez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Bottomless Pit is a short fiction story based on a chapter in the Bible, Revelation Chapter nine (King James Version). This story describes a set of events as told by Paul, the main character, who finds himself lost and confused over a series of events that transpire out of his control over a period of roughly two years. It is set in current times or perhaps a few years into the future. The setting is on or near a national forest somewhere in the northwestern United States. This story illustrates the short-sightedness of man and his inability to change his nature regardless of events that occur in his surroundings. A few are deeply impacted, but the majority of people continue with life as usual.&lt;/P&gt;" />
