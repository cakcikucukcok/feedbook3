  <title>A Messenger so Dark - Joel Pierson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tristan Shays is beginning to think he may be a messenger after all. After leaving his job as president of his own company, he embarks on a mission to investigate the clandestine and potentially evil agency known only as SODARCOM. The trouble is, hes gone rogue, following his own path rather than the assignments he usually getsvisions of strangers in peril that he must warn, accompanied by intense pain if he refuses. With no divine guidance to assist them, he and his new best friend, Genevieve, must rely on instinct and luck to find answers about SODARCOMs drug study for cancer patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The missions keep coming, diverting Tristan from his goal of getting answers. Even so, when his assignments start relating to people involved in the drug study, he suspects hes on the right track. The closer he gets to the answers he seeks, the more danger he and Genevieve encounter. Torn between his promise to keep Genevieve safe and his need to see justice served, Tristan must rely on all his resources just to come out alive, let alone victorious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fifth book in the Messenger series, &lt;i&gt;A Messenger So Dark&lt;/i&gt; challenges popular beliefs about right and wrong and asks a difficult question: is survival a right or a privilege?&lt;/p&gt;" />
