  <title>Street Fighter - Bill Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Neville Shepherd Ladderback, the &lt;i&gt;Philadelphia Press&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; &quot;old, dusty&quot; obituary writer, is researching accountant Paul Small, a city legend in all things dealing with money, who was beaten to death with his own cane. Finding it hard to get a straight story, Ladderback is surprised when Andrea &quot;Andy&quot; Cosicki, the voice behind the &quot;Mr. Action&quot; question-and-answer column, provides him with a key lead. But as each reporter searches for the &quot;nut,&quot; or defining element, in their stories, they find that this exchange is just the beginning in a series of startling discoveries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Paul Small&#39;s death brings back Andy&#39;s best friend, Lucia; her mother had been involved with the dead man.  The young women&#39;s reunion is interrupted by a violent confrontation with members of an Asian gang at a restaurant owned by Angelo Delise, the father of Lucia&#39;s friend Cece, who was raped and murdered years ago in the Asian immigrant sector of the city. The gang members were trying to get Delise&#39;s safe but failed, overpowered by Lucia&#39;s skill in the martial arts. Andy can see how Cece&#39;s death still haunts Lucia and she vows to find out the true story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ladderback&#39;s and Andy&#39;s investigations keep leading them back to the Pickle Factory, which used to be a warehouse crowded with illegal Asian immigrants but was later developed into luxury lofts by Small&#39;s nonprofit veterans organization.  Did Small make promises he couldn&#39;t keep?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Community tension rides high in this third mystery from Bill Kent, an author who is well acquainted with the vibrant characters who live, and die, in gritty South Philly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
