  <title>A Cruise to Remember - Garland Ladd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;An important anniversary for a special group of people called for something special. They were celebrating the first year of successful operation of a humanitarian organization that had already enhanced the lives of thousands. As founders and Directors of the organization, a cruise seemed an ideal way of combining business and pleasure, and the Caribbean Seas was selected.&lt;P&gt;	Prior to boarding in Miami, one of their members and his wife became embroiled in a brutal spat involving strangers. The victim, an attractive but destitute young lady, was beaten by a drunken businessman and Luke Strong observed the attack. He became incensed and took retaliatory action, but more importantly, he and his wife temporarily adopted the victim and invited her on the cruise as their guest.&lt;P&gt;	The attacker ended up on the same cruise whereby Luke learned that the abuser was the Executive Director of an Association in which the Strongs were members. He also learned that the guy was crooked, a wife beater, philander and ruthless in his business dealings. Thereupon, the cruise took on an additional purpose - - the exposure of the assailant. &lt;P&gt;The assembled group then devised a clever sting operation that lured the assailant into a trap using greed as bait. The sting also produced further humanitarian efforts that capitalized on the special talents of the abused young lady. A pleasurable time with old friends, making new friends, exposing a devious abuse, coupled with propelling their humanitarian effort forward all combined to make it a Cruise To Remember.&lt;/P&gt;" />
