  <title>SPQR V: Saturnalia - John Maddox Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This eagerly awaited fifth book in John Maddox Roberts&#39;s Edgar-nominated historical mystery series once again takes the reader back to the Rome of Julius Caesar and the Roman Senator Decius Caecilius Metellus the Younger. Decius has won himself a reputation as both an investigator and, most unfortunately, a bit of a playboy. Having been banished by his family for sometimes embarrassing activities to a rather leisurely lifestyle on Rhodes, he is puzzled to be suddenly  and unexpectedly summoned home to assist in an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, a relative of Decius and his family and the head of a powerful political clan, has been poisoned, and his infamous wife Clodia is immediately suspected of disposing of her rather inconvenient husband. Not entirely convinced of Clodia&#39;s guilt, Decius delves into the intricacies of Rome&#39;s ruling class and discovers that a clandestine, forbidden witches&#39; cult is inextricably intertwined with some very highborn people. A trial for Clodia would be most unwelcome, as it could bring to light some well-kept secrets. To get to the bottom of the corruption that accompanies the intoxicating allure of this ancient city, Decius must form an uneasy alliance with Clodius, Clodia&#39;s brother and his sworn enemy, and be&lt;i&gt; extremely&lt;/i&gt; careful not to step on any toes.&lt;/p&gt;" />
