  <title>Some Wild Things - Bill Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Some Wild Things is a fictional fast-moving humorous adult story based on the premise that there is no such thing as coincidencewhatever happens in life is ultimately meant to be. It addresses dramatic events, at times horrific, that take place when cross sections of people from different walks of life become entwined in a net of circumstance and chaos beyond their control. This culminates in a web of intrigue played out against an expeditious backdrop of romance, violence, incest, and murder. 
The protagonists are a sordid, interbred trailer park family that ruthlessly blazes a trail of cold-blooded havoc across an arid and hostile mineral-rich desert region that is plagued by incessant sandstorms and is home to a population of lethal Egyptian cobras. It is a story of double-dealing mining corruption, where an opposing mining conglomerate is on a ruthless mission to control and, if necessary, destroy their opposition. This leads to a terrifying web of bizarre ongoing pandemonium that involves assassination, gold bullion heists, and international drug syndicates under the guise of touring magicians. This lethal, somewhat humorous family spearheads the high-speed action and never-ending mayhem throughout the story, concluding with a double-dealing rip-off by entrepreneurial Somali pirates raising finance for their cause. 
Some Wild Things is dramatic, fast, and funny, with a sprinkling of brutal insanity that endorses once again the premise that there is no such thing as coincidence. 
Think Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, and Two Smoking Barrels and youve got Some Wild Things." />
