  <title>Skies of Ash - Rachel Howzell Hall</title>

Juliet Chatman perished in the blaze, along with her two children. Left behind is grieving husband and father Christopher Chatman, hospitalized after trying to rescue his family. Chatman is devastated that he couldn&#39;t save them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unless, of course, he&#39;s the one who killed them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neighbors and family friends insist the Chatmans were living the dream.

The flames of adultery, jealousy, scandal, fraud, and disease had all but consumed the Chatmans&#39; marriage before it went up in smoke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lou&#39;s own marriage hangs by a thread. Soured by the men in her life, Lou is convinced that Chatman started the fire. Her colleagues worry that her personal issues are obscuring her judgment.
