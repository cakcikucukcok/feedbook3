  <title>Personal War - Dave Aquino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;William Defreno is down on his luck and himself. Maybe it&#39;s that he lives in a town seemingly owned by a rich man, Randy Casner, who has the police in his pocket, infinite resources, and doesn&#39;t care who he destroys in order to get his own way. &lt;br&gt;The dreadful Personal War starts when Randy runs William down with his Hummer, breaking the young track star&#39;s leg in a rage of general lunacy and resentment for William&#39;s track talent. William tries to pursue Mr. Casner legally, and discovers the full extent of this man&#39;s power. Everything starts to down-spiral from there. &lt;br&gt;The local police begin to systematically harass him - trying to get him fired from his job, arrest him for any and every reason possible and ruin any chance of William having a relationship of any kind. The more William tries to fight back, the worse the warfare gets. &lt;br&gt;By the time William wants to quit the Personal War, it&#39;s too late. He is forced to engage in battle against Mr. Casner who is clearly superior to him in every way. With a little help from his friends, William, &#39;the underdog&#39; must find the willpower and strength within to save himself. &lt;br&gt;&quot;Yes, people love an underdog, but they always bet against him...&quot; William Defreno  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dave Aquino is the author of several novels, including &lt;i&gt;Personal War, Personal War 2, Counselor&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Slot Machine&lt;/i&gt;. He is working on his next novel." />
