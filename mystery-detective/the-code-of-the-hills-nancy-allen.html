  <title>The Code of the Hills - Nancy Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To uncover the truth, she&amp;#39;ll have to break the code of the hills &amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Missouri Ozarks, some things aren&amp;#39;t talked about &amp;#8230; even abuse. But prosecutor Elsie Arnold is determined to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she is assigned to prosecute a high-profile incest case in which a father is accused of abusing his three young daughters, Elsie is ready to become the Ozarks&amp;#39; avenging angel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Elsie sinks her teeth into the case, everything begins to turn sour. The star witness goes missing; the girls refuse to talk about their father, who terrorizes the courtroom from the moment he enters; and Elsie begins to suspect that their tough-as-nails mother has ulterior motives. To make matters worse, Elsie receives gruesome threats from local extremists, warning her to mind her own business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Elsie swears not to let a sex offender walk, she realizes the odds&amp;#8212;and maybe the town&amp;#8212;are against her, and her life begins to crumble. But amidst all of the conflict, the safety of three young girls hangs in the balance ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A powerful debut, with the haunting atmosphere of &lt;em&gt;Winter&amp;#39;s Bone&lt;/em&gt; and the page-turning suspense of Alafair Burke&amp;#39;s thrillers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
