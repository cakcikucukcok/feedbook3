  <title>What Remains of Her - Eric Rickstad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;The Silent Girls&lt;/em&gt; comes this chilling, harrowing thriller set in rural Vermont about a recluse who believes the young girl he&#39;s found in the woods is the reincarnation of his missing daughter, returned to help him solve her and his wife&#39;s disappearance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I won&amp;#8217;t say a word. Cross my heart and hope to die&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonah Baum, a professor of poetry at a local college in Vermont, sees his ordinary life come tumbling down when his wife and young daughter vanish from their home. No evidence of a kidnapping. No sign of murder. No proof that Rebecca didn&amp;#8217;t simply abandon her marriage. Just Sally&amp;#8217;s crude and chilling drawings, Jonah&amp;#8217;s little lies, and the sheriff&amp;#8217;s nagging fears that nothing is what it seems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Sally&amp;#8217;s best friend, Lucinda, it&amp;#8217;s something else. She trusts in Sally not to just disappear, not after they&amp;#8217;ve shared so many secrets&amp;#8212;especially about the woods and what they saw there. But she&amp;#8217;ll never tell. No one would believe her anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the search for Rebecca and Sally intensifies, and as suspicion falls on Jonah, the disappearances become more relentlessly haunting than anyone can imagine. Because what&amp;#8217;s seen in the light of day is not nearly as terrifying as what remains hidden in the dark&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;" />
