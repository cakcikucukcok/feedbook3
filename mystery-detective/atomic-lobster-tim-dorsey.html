  <title>Atomic Lobster - Tim Dorsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why is everyone rushing to flee Tampa on a cruise ship to hell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Serge is back with a bullet, torn between homicide and souvenirs. So is Coleman, torn between getting hammered and getting more hammered. Then there&#39;s good ol&#39; Jim Davenport, the E-Team, the Diaz Brothers, and Johnny Vegas, the Accidental Virgin, cranking up the fevered action as the pot boils over on a street called Lobster Lane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s reunion time in the Sunshine State, and we&#39;re not just talking the family jamboree of that blood-soaked criminal clan, the McGraws, whose nastiest, meanest member is finally released from prison and heads south bent on revenge. On top of it all, the government is covering up a growing list of mysterious victims across Florida who may or may not be connected to a nefarious plot being hatched against national security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But wait! There&#39;s more on the horizon! Who is the oddly familiar femme fatale named Rachael? Is Serge wrong that guns, drugs, and strippers don&#39;t mix? What sets the Non-Confrontationalists off on a rampage? What finally brings Coleman and Lenny together? Will they succeed in building the biggest bong ever? And can Serge surf a rogue wave to victory?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So batten the hatches, don the life jackets, and take cover as all these questions and more are answered in the latest adventure from the acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Hurricane Punch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
