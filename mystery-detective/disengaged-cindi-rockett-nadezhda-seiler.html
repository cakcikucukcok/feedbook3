  <title>Disengaged - Cindi Rockett, Nadezhda Seiler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stanford law student Brian Deiritz has it allmoney, a talented fiance, and a bright futureuntil he vanishes in his hometown of San Francisco one month before the wedding. The police and his family wonder if its suicide, murder, or kidnapping. But his bride-to-be, Hope Day, thinks he just might be walking out on his commitment to her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distraught after the police question her, Hope flees to Germany, where she and Brian were supposed to honeymoon. She prays against all odds that her betrothed will be waiting for her, but it is not to be. Meanwhile, Vic, who is Hopes best friend and Brians sister, launches her own search for her missing brother in San Francisco. Ironically, she becomes a whiz at being a grieving sister, investigator, ex-lover, and new lover all at once. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Searching for the truth behind Brians disappearance, Hope and Vic find themselves separated by half a world and enmeshed in events that occurred six decades ago, during World War II. Their letters, filled with updates on their discoveries, start flying back and forth from Bavaria to California. Will their determination and love for Brian help them find him and the answers to their mystery?&lt;/p&gt;" />
