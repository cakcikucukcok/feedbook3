  <title>Experiment Xiii - Jensen Roman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 2041, America has just been victorious in a third world war, and Mia Bishop has no idea she is the new guinea pig for Experiment XIII. At a time when prolonging human life still seems to be unattainable, a government agency located beneath a desolate Montana town secretly steals a life with the hope of saving millions. But Mia is oblivious as she takes an elevator ride underground for what she thinks is the first day of her new job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mias first assignment is to carry a tray of food into a room devoid of anything but a strange-looking capsule. As a hand suddenly emerges from the device, Mia is frozen with fear. A chained man slowly reveals himself to Mia, and she realizes he is a slave to the contraption. Athen has spent twenty-seven years in solitary confinement at the mercy of curious scientists and a secret drug. But no one expects the governments clan-destine project to begin forming ideas on his ownespecially the nave Mia, who is ignorant to the terror he is capable of instilling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this futuristic tale, as the drama of an underground experiment gone terribly wrong slowly unfolds, a man focused on pursuing a peaceful life in the real world is about to discover just how difficult it can be to make his dreams come trueespecially when he is Experiment XIII.&lt;/p&gt;" />
