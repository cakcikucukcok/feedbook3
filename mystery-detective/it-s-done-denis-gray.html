  <title>It’S Done - Denis Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forty-nine-year-old Dade Eduardo Lord is the founder and president of Precision Records, a heavyweight record company based in New York City. Lord loves money, and, in fact, he worships it. At the age of twenty-three, he fathered a child, Crystal Hill, whom he abandoned at birth. &lt;p&gt;
At sixteen, Crystal became MC Ms. Lady, a Brooklyn-based rapper. By age nineteen, shes known as the queen of hip-hop with hit records produced by Konscious Flow Productions, a rival hip-hop company of Precision Records. Not only is Crystal a brilliant rapper, but a scholar who attended Harvard University for one year, landing on its Deans list. She envisions being more than just a rapper; she aspires to be a record executive. &lt;p&gt;
Crystal meets with Lord and earns an executive internship position at Precision Records. But she harbors a deeper and more personal reason for wanting to intern with her fathers company. Is it to seek Lords love and approval or to destroy him because of his past deeds and abandonment?&lt;p&gt;" />
