  <title>Orchestrated Murder - Rick Blechta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Something is terribly wrong at Symphony Hall. Luigi Spadafini, the symphony&#39;s star conductor, has been murdered--and the entire orchestra has confessed to the crime. This is the mess that Detective Lieutenant Pratt walks into one Saturday morning. Overworked and tired, he&#39;s also saddled with Detective Ellis, the newest member of the homicide squad and still very wet behind the ears.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;With both the mayor and several big shots from the symphony&#39;s board of directors demanding a speedy resolution of the crisis, Pratt is pushed to the limit. The trouble is, he also faces a seemingly endless list of suspects with good reasons to want the philandering Spadafini dead. With the clock ticking, Pratt is forced to use both his wits and the computer skills of Detective Ellis to solve the mystery." />
