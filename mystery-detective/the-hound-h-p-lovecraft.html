  <title>The Hound - H.P. Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;The Hound&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; is a short story written by H. P. Lovecraft in September 1922 and published in the February 1924 issue of &lt;i&gt;Weird Tales&lt;/i&gt;. It contains the first mention of Lovecraft&amp;#39;s fictional text the &lt;i&gt;Necronomicon&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;The story focuses around the narrator and his friend St. John, who have a deranged interest in robbing graves. They constantly defile crypts and often keep souvenirs of their nocturnal expeditions. Since they reside in the same house, they have the opportunity to set up a sort of morbid museum in their basement. Using the objects they collect from the various graves they have robbed, they organize the private exhibition. The collection consists of headstones, preserved bodies, skulls, and several heads in different phases of decomposition. It also included statues, frightful paintings, and a locked portfolio bound in tanned human-skin. One day, they learn of a particular grave, which sparks a profound interest in them, an old grave in a Holland cemetery, which holds a legendary tomb raider within. One who was said to have stolen, many years ago, a &amp;ldquo;potent thing from an mighty sepulcher.&amp;quot; One night, they travel to this old cemetery where the ancient &amp;ldquo;ghoul&amp;rdquo; was buried. The thought of exhuming the final resting place of a former grave robber is irresistibly appealing to them&amp;hellip;" />
