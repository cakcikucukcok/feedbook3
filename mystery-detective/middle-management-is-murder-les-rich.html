  <title>Middle Management Is Murder - Les Rich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When John Robinson, a New Mexico native, heads to Branhaven, Connecticut, he has no idea what lies in wait within the offices of corporate America.&lt;p&gt; 
As a writer at Heinlein, Inc., a global liquor and foods conglomerate, John learns fast that his boss, Paul Mac McDermott, is a tyrant who likes letting his staff sit in the meeting room picking at pastries for at least fifteen minutes before making a grand entrance. And thats just the beginning.&lt;p&gt; 
Almost everyone hates McDermott, but they tolerate him because they are well paid and receive great benefits and stock options that would be otherwise hard to match. But when McDermott suffers a serious stroke and later turns up dead, people start wondering if someone in the office might be a killer.&lt;p&gt; 
Marcia, a tall, gorgeous brunette attracts the most attention, and not just from investigators. Together, she and John must uncover the truth, or could they in actuality be trying to hide it?&lt;p&gt; 
Sexy scenarios, comedy, and mystery all play a part at the offices of Heinlein where Middle Management is Murder." />
