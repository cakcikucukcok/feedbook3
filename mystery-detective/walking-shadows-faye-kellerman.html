  <title>Walking Shadows - Faye Kellerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Detective Peter Decker and his wife, Rina Lazarus, risk life and limb to solve a pair of brutal murders that may be tied to a crime from more than twenty years ago in this intense and addictive mystery from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Faye Kellerman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a quiet suburban street in upstate Greenbury, New York, the brutally beaten body of a young man is discovered in the woods adjacent to an empty vacation home. Twenty-six-year-old Brady Neil a resident of the neighboring town of Hamilton, had no criminal record, few friends, worked full-time, and attended community college. But as Detective Peter Decker learns, the clean-cut kid is linked to the criminal world. When Brady was a baby, his father, Brandon Gratz, was convicted of robbing and killing the owners of a local jewelry store. While Gratz and his partner, Kyle Masterson, admitted to the robbery, they swore they left the owners, Glen and Lydia Levine, very much alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experienced detective knows there&amp;#8217;s more to this homicide case than the records show. As he digs into Gratz&amp;#8217;s past, Decker begins to suspect that the son&amp;#8217;s murder may be connected to the father&amp;#8217;s sins. Before he can put together the pieces, Decker finds out that one of Brady Neil&amp;#8217;s friends, Joseph Boch&amp;#8212;aka Boxer&amp;#8212;has gone missing. Heading to Boch&amp;#8217;s house with his temporary new partner, Hamilton PD cop Lenora Baccus, they discover a bloodbath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who would savagely kill two innocent men&amp;#8212;and why? Finding the answers will require all of Decker&amp;#8217;s skill and knowledge, the help of his fellow Greenbury detectives, Tyler McAdams and Kevin Butterfield, and information gleaned from his wife Rina&amp;#8217;s behind the scenes investigation to put all the pieces of this deadly puzzle together . . . and see justice done.&lt;/p&gt;" />
