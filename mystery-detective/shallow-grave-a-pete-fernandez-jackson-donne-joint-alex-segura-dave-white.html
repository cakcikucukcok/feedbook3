  <title>Shallow Grave: A Pete Fernandez/Jackson Donne Joint - Alex Segura, Dave White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Five years ago, Gilbert &quot;GG&quot; Garcia - bassist for beloved New Brunswick, NJ indie band Magna Carta - went off the grid. At the request of GG&#39;s sister, P.i. Jackson Donne made some inquiries but hit a wall. Aside from allegations of mob involvement and illegal betting, the leads had dried up and GG was in the wind. Soon enough, the case went cold and Donne moved on.  Five years later, Miami P.I. Pete Fernandez gets a frantic call from an old friend - a police detective stationed in his old stomping grounds of New Jersey - asking for a favor he can&#39;t discuss over the phone. Bruised and battered from a near-fatal run-in with a lethal serial killer, Pete welcomes the brief change of scenery. Or escape. Pete discovers the GG case has frozen solid, with only one flicker of hope for solving it: talking to the first detective who tried to find the local-boy-gone-missing. But there&#39;s one problem: Jackson Donne is in prison for murder.  Pulled into an uneasy alliance with the older, jaded detective, Pete must pick up the pieces of Donne&#39;s work to learn the missing bassist&#39;s final fate, while also avoiding an unexpected mob turf war and locals who prefer the past stay buried.  SHALLOW GRAVE pairs two of the best crime writers working today, Dave White and Alex Segura, pairing up their acclaimed characters in an unforgettable tale of lost hopes, dangerous alliances and sinister betrayals." />
