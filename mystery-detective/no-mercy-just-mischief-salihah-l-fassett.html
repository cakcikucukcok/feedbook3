  <title>No Mercy Just Mischief - Salihah L. Fassett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Shortly after, two men stood at the entrance of the apartment, the bullet riddled bodies told a story of horror.  Both men were dressed impeccably. One wore a blue pinstripe suit, white shirt, red satin tie, navy blue alligator shoes and a Borsalino that was carefully broken down just right, shadowing his handsome face.   His fingers were laced in diamonds and he carried a cane with the head of a lion with jeweled eyes. &lt;br&gt;
  In front of him came in a slender gentlemen, dress in a black suit and dark shades he was called Decipher. He was the one that made sure the room was clear standing with his back against the opened door gun in hand. &lt;br&gt;
 The man with the cane walked into the room stepping over dead bodies.  He quickly went into the bedroom he removed the recliner that protected the hidden floor compartment.   He opened the compartment door and removed the infant she was fine. She smiled up at him and through all that chaos she never made a sound.  He pulled her close to his chest and kissed her on the forehead.  Before leaving he removed several envelopes from the compartment and money that was stacked in hundred dollar increments.  He walked over to Ebonys body and removed the sterling silver heart locket from her neck. He and the gentlemen left. Sirens echoed from a short distance, the boys in blue were coming it was only two hours later. &lt;br&gt;" />
