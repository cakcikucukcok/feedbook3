  <title>Forbidden Steps - Ed Rambeau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Chad Kipton is a 22-year-old top male model returning home for his fathers funeral and has no idea whats in store for him as he comes face to face with his fears, and eventually suffers the ultimate punishment for his passion. His stepmother, Vivian, also isnt aware of what terror lies ahead when her beloved husband, Frank, dies suddenly of a heart attack, and her youngest stepson17-year-old Dannybecomes tangled in a web so cleverly woven that he becomes blinded by his hatred. After the devastating event that took the life of Franks first wife, Margo, Vivian made it her goal to snag Frank, the love of her life. All was going well until Chad returns home. Just when you think youve heard it all, things go topsy-turvy in this unbelievable twist of events as Vivian finds herself accused of two murders. Was she involved? Shelly, her alcoholic sister-in-law, strongly believes sobut is she right? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book Review&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;5.0 out of 5 stars A Must Read!!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Just finished reading Forbidden Steps and loved every sentence of it! This was a fun novel to read that had my head spinning from the beginning right until the unexpected end. The story is a quick and easy read full of romance, mystery, murder and sex. There are so many twists and turns, I found myself giving up on trying to guess the end and just went along for the crazy, intense ride! As a first time novelist, Mr. Rambeau captured my attention right from the start and held my attention until the very last word, at which point, I honestly wanted more. One can only hope there will be a Forbidden Steps Part 2!!! I highly recommend Forbidden Steps and eagerly await Ed Rambeau&#39;s next novel. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Alisa K.

WOW!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Wow! Wow! Wow! What a page turner! You CANNOT put it down. The storyline is so fresh and so well-written that I never saw any of the 3 amazing twists coming, and they were not only unexpected, but all mind-blowers. Can&#39;t wait to see the movie. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Greg Maro &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.0 out of 5 stars Ed Rambeau&#39;s Ingenious Debut Novel is Concrete Solid!&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;Many talented people have found a measure of fame and fortune through fields such as acting, singing or songwriting; some show talent and proficiency in more than one endeavor (i.e., singers who write their own material). But not every artist is multitalented. Vocalists whose acting performances were panned by critics, or actors whose recordings made them laughingstocks rather than chartbusters, will attest to this. There are, however, exceptions, and Ed Rambeau, best known for his achievements in pop music, is such an exception. Rambeau&#39;s debut novel, a murder mystery entitled FORBIDDEN STEPS, is Exhibit A, proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Rambeau is one of those gifted entertainers who can more than hold his own in just about any field of the arts. Actually, STEPS should more properly be designated as Exhibit H, for prior to its release Rambeau had already established a solid name for himself as a songwriter, singer, actor, producer, arranger, photographer, and artist. Rambeau was one of the composers of the hit single &quot;Navy Blue,&quot; as recorded by Diane Renay in 1964, and gained fame as a recording artist whose version of &quot;Concrete and Clay&quot; made the U.S. Top Thirty a year later.
