  <title>Dead Without Pride - Diane Bator</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gilda Wright has always had an open mind about the spiritual world. Dating the hot sensei at her martial arts school, Mick Williams, has taught her that mind, body, and spirit have a strong connection. But when her good friend and sometimes flirtation, Kane Garrick hires a pretty psychic at his New Age store, Gilda finds herself torn between being glad he&#39;s distracted and feeling just the teeny-tiniest bit jealous. A feeling that quickly turns to suspicion when the psychic&#39;s predictions begin to come true—including one about the murder of a well-known person in their small town! Suddenly Gilda wonders if the psychic&#39;s involvement in both her predictions and Kane&#39;s life are mere coincidence or a clever set up. It&#39;s up to Gilda to find the truth and track down a killer...before her own death becomes next on the psychic&#39;s prediction list!" />
