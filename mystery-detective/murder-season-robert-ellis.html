  <title>Murder Season - Robert Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Detective Lena Gamble knows how to handle the hottest cases--do it fast and keep her head down. Because if it all goes south, the department won&#39;t hesitate to make a scapegoat out of her. So when she gets called to the scene of a double murder at Club 3 AM, the latest A-list hangout for Hollywood celebs, she knows the fun is only beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And she&#39;s not wrong. It&#39;s just much worse than she imagined. As expected, one of the victims is club owner Johnny Bosco, one of the most well-connected men in Hollywood politics. But the shocker comes when Lena sees the other victim: twenty-five-year-old Jacob Gant, acquitted just days ago of murdering his sixteen-year-old neighbor, after L.A.&#39;s latest trial-of-the-century. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But are these victims of a father&#39;s righteous anger or is something bigger at play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert Ellis delivers all the twists and turns fans have come to expect in this bestselling series with plenty to spare in &lt;i&gt;Murder Season&lt;/i&gt;, his most outstanding white-knuckled thriller yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
