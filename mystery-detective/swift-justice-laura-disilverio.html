  <title>Swift Justice - Laura DiSilverio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Swift prefers working alone. That&#39;s why after eight years as an Air Force investigator she became a PI rather than a cop. She lives alone, she works alone, and aside for the occasional flirtation with sexy cop Connor Montgomery or her hunky neighbor Father Dan, she likes it that way. Then her silent partner flees the country, leaving his wife, Gigi, with nothing but the house, the Hummer, and a half interest in Swift Investigations. Charlie ends up with a heap of debt and Gigi, who has decided to be a not-so-silent partner. This change comes about while Charlie is trying to find the mother of a baby abandoned on a client&#39;s doorstep. While following leads, she sends Gigi out on crazy assignments, hoping that the pampered socialite will be driven to quit. However, when the baby&#39;s mother turns up dead, there&#39;s a murderer on the loose, and Charlie will need all the help she can get. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Swift Justice&lt;/i&gt; is a Lefty Award finalist for best humorous mystery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
