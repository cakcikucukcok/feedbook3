  <title>Forgiven but Not Forgotten - Tyrone Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We as people wonder through life looking and desiring to be love. So when that doesnt happen the way we wish it to happen we have that feeling of individual separation from the world. So tell me how do you handle it when you are born into the world desiring it but cant get it as a baby? 
	Twin came into this world looking to be embraced but received a cold shoulder from the one that was supposed to be his protection from those that brings hurt, hate, and harm. How do you fight against that kind of pain? Taking his twin and giving him the best of the world while giving his other trash Twin could not do anything but reach out and ask for help from nothing more than the cold heated streets of Parkwood and the nation of GD. They became his family and learnt to rely on.
	Twin was born into this world with muscle tissue over muscle tissue and a heart that was too big for his body. This caused him to spend a lot of his childhood in the hospital and with a father who was more into a son that would be a payoff other than another bill only caused Twin to be that much hated by his own family, but mostly by his father who love one twin and a strong dislike for the other.
	The older Twin became the smarter he got with a well to win at everything that he did. From school to the streets Twin was not a push over. Making the streets cry out in pain to showing others that he is cut differently than his family. Yelling Gangster Disciple and letting those forks stand high Twin back down to nothing at all. With a passion to seeing others cry in pain he desire to dance and kick box until he had no more need to do so any more. 
	Driving the ladies crazy with his ability to just being him only made others wishing to be around the you man that he was becoming while others fear the man thats determent to put you down rather to see you take up air in a world that can live without you.
	Forgiven but not forgotten is more than just a book its dealing with every day truth and the fact that a decision can change the walk of someones life. If you love a book filled with action, mob, gang, sex, love, hurt and pain-you will love this book. 
	Come and allow me Tyrone L. Edwards Sr. take you to another place that will pull you in and send your emotions pulling in many ways. Everything you desire to feel from a book. I will take you there. Try me and see. What do you have to lose other than a few bills?" />
