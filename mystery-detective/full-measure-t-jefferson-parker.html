He returns home exhilarated by his new freedom and eager to realize his dream of a sport fishing business. But he is shocked to learn that the avocado ranch his family has owned for generations in the foothills of San Diego has been destroyed by a massive wildfire and the parents he loves are facing ruin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ted Norris worships his brother and yearns for his approval. Gentle by nature, but tormented by strange fixations with a dark undercurrent, Ted is drawn into a circle of violent, criminal misfits. His urgent quest to prove himself threatens to put those he loves in peril.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick puts his own plans on hold to save the family&#39;s home and falls in love with Iris, a beautiful and unusual woman, when disaster strikes. When Ted&#39;s plan for redemption goes terribly wrong, he tries to disappear. Desperate to find his brother and salvage what remains of his family, Patrick must make an agonizing choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three-time Edgar Award-winner T.
