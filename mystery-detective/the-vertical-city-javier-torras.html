  <title>The Vertical City - Javier Torras</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
The Vertical City transports us to a dystopian and terrifying future in which the history and the critical capacity of citizens have been nullified. However, a group of people strive to maintain human dignity and fight against the urban totalitarianism of the Great Families that base their social privilege on the supposed purity of blood.&lt;br/&gt;
The new civilization dwells in endless skyscrapers built for man by the natural disasters that ravages the mainland. Men and women coexist in an alienated society that does not question the past, the present or the future; the cohesive element that allows them to move forward is fear ... fear of the unknown, of the different. Fear of mestizos.&lt;br/&gt;
All the inhabitants of the Vertical City have &#39;pure&#39; blood, while the mestizos have been abandoned in the subsoil, under the millions of tons that feed the new social order. The story reflects on the interest of others to climb and the need for others to descend, a constant intrigue full of games of power, revenge and hatred. It is a constant adventure to illuminate the unknown, rediscover the past to be able to face the future.&lt;br/&gt;
With a climbing plot and full of surprises, this novel combines elements of science fiction with the adventure to carry out an unexpected ending in which no one is who he seems to be.
