  <title>National Security: A Kate Killoy Mystery: Suspense for the Dog Lover - Peggy Gaffney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Samoyed National becomes ground zero in a fight to keep the country from being destroyed. The FBI and NSA realize Kate knows the answer, but Kate can&amp;#39;t even figure out the question. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;NATIONAL SECURITY, the third book in Peggy Gaffney&amp;#39;s Kate Killoy Mystery series of Suspense for the Dog Lover, is filled with fast-paced excitement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate and her fiance Harry are looking forward to attending the Samoyed National. Their lives are turned upside down when a friend of Kate&amp;rsquo;s is murdered. Instead of spending a week surrounded by hundred of their favorite smiling white Arctic dogs, they must work to find a clue left by a dead woman. Killers try to stop Kate since they&amp;rsquo;ve heard she has the information. Kate recruits a retired Russian spy, the Coyote, to help her find the clue. It&amp;rsquo;s the only&amp;nbsp;way to stop this evil. For Harry, the most important element&amp;nbsp;is--with Kate as the main target--to keep&amp;nbsp;her alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate is determined to find her friend&amp;#39;s killer, but the NSA and the FBI are more interested in the secret they are sure has been given to Kate. They don&amp;#39;t believe her when she says she&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#39;t get anything from her friend that was important to national security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agents tend to doubt her, even more, when someone tries to kill her at every opportunity. While Harry and her friends are trying to keep her alive,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So between trips into the ring to compete in agility, obedience, and breed classes with her dogs, and dodging bullets, Kate and Harry must figure out who is behind a plot to destroy America, and stop them, all while Kate is still&amp;nbsp;doing her best in the ring to win.&lt;/p&gt;" />
