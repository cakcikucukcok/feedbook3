  <title>Thin Ice - Paige Shelton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stunning wilds of Alaska are not for the faint of heart--but when Beth Rivers finds herself with a need to disappear, she&#39;s already faced far worse. So how hard could it be?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beth Rivers, known to the world as Elizabeth Fairchild, has spent years as a bestselling novelist. Her twisty, page-turning thrillers have garnered a legion of fans, but unfortunately, her story-telling landed her in an unbelievable tale of her own--a situation even more terrifying than she could have dreamed. Crazed Elizabeth Fairchild super-fan Levi Brooks stalked and kidnapped Elizabeth, holding her captive inside a van for three days. She escaped by throwing herself from the speeding van, suffering a severe head injury and memory loss.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Scarred and still healing from her injuries, she secretly escapes to the beautiful--and very remote--Benedict, Alaska. It&#39;s the only place she can be sure no one will find her. But just before Beth&#39;s arrival, the already small population of Benedict was reduced by one. Linda Rafferty&#39;s death was ruled a suicide, but no one in the close-knit community quite believes that conclusion, even the sheriff. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While she waits for her attacker to be apprehended in the lower 48, Beth takes on a project to revamp the Benedict town newspaper. She knows enough to go where the story is, and there&#39;s clearly one behind Linda&#39;s death. As rumors of murder spread, suspicion falls upon the felons staying at a local halfway house--and Beth herself. Intrigued by both the mystery and the wary folks who call Benedict home, Beth starts asking questions--only to find her investigation stirring up memories she&#39;d much rather had stayed forgotten...&lt;/p&gt;" />
