  <title>Reckless Dreaming - Nick David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I hope readers will enjoy creating Reckless Dreaming as a movie in their mind. That is ahead of any possible theatrical production. - Nick David, Screenwriter&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;                   
ENLIGHTENMENT, LOVE, AND A STING ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER AND YET SO FAR AWAY. WELCOME TO THE WORLD OF RECKLESS DREAMING!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Imagine a game of Strip Chess surrounded everywhere you turn by strip the soul! Michael and Tara use everything including their wits for weapons! Meanwhile, no knowledge of chess will be needed to determine who is winning as their match progresses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  
Chess masters Tara, 33, and Michael, 34, stage a high stakes match in San Francisco that their chess rival fathers never got a chance to play. Michael is an intense win at any cost player with his own obsessions. Tara is an embattled singer and Eastern Religion buff. As a reformed alcoholic, she leaves a Buddhist monastery on a quest for enlightenment and love. Tara keeps one vital secret from Michael: She has a brain tumor which could kill her at any time! Not knowing her condition, Michael hires Destiny, a possible girlfriend who is into the occult, to play mind games on Tara. However, Destiny plans much more than just mental harm. In a class, Destiny receives a device that helps her enter other peoples dreams. Then, as Destiny remarks, What could they charge me with, reckless dreaming? Meanwhile, psychotic fellow-dreamer Dwayne pursues a Tarot card riddle which doesnt bode well for Tara! A female artist influences events in unique ways. Additional obstacles stack the deck against our heroine.  More conflict brews in the subplot. It reveals that Tara, Michael, and the rest of the cast are pitted against the unscrupulous producer Wesley. Its all yours to find out if a sting causes the plot and subplot to merge into multiple twist climaxes!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Comments from 3 Professional Script Consultants:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
Paul Youngs clients have included Academy Award Nominees for Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay as well as the Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Paul wrote that Reckless Dreaming has plausibility, substance, focus, resonance, appeal, and emotional power, which helps to create a single film with its own inner layers and complexities. - Literary &amp; Screenplay Consultants Woodland Hills, CA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
All in all, youve succeeded in writing an interesting erotic film which has intellectual appeal.&lt;br&gt;
- Caroline Blair San Francisco, CA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
 You have drawn a very creative visual treatment for moving into and out of dream-space and time.&lt;br&gt;
