  <title>Louisiana Lady - Marilyn Parman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LOUISIANA LADY By Marilyn Parman was written at the request of her late friend, Carol Lee from Friday Harbor, &lt;br&gt;Washington, who passed away a number of years ago. The story was partially based on the lives of someone whom she knew, however, it is primarily fiction and is narrated by Carolyn Pevateaux, a lady from the old Cajun culture that existed in Louisiana. The story is one of suspense and exposes some of the abuses against women and children that were not that uncommon during those early days in many places and still can be found in some places in the United States as well as many other places in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The ending is a total surprise but resolves nicely and there is an epilogue to bring the reader current to some issues that also needed a solution. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; For every book that is sold, the author plans to give a dollar to the most effective charitable organization that protects and helps women and children when they are victims of violence or sexual assault. &lt;br&gt;" />
