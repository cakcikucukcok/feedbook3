      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A gripping new novel in the three-time Shamus Award-winning Amos Walker series.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;calls Amos Walker a &quot;streetwise indestructible tiger with an ethical code that keeps him with the good guys.&quot; In a sharp new thriller, Detroit&#39;s most savvy private eye is up to his neck in international drug-smuggling, hit squads, double-identities, music- industry gangsters, and a client who&#39;s nothing but trouble.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Gilia Cristobal is a singer with a complicated past. Her name isn&#39;t really Gilia. In her country she&#39;s wanted for a murder she didn&#39;t commit, and she needs Walker to find a missing woman whose name she&#39;s using, whom she&#39;s been paying monthly so she can stay in the U.S. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when the decomposing body of the real Gilia Cristobal is found next door to her mother&#39;s house, what was merely an odd case becomes downright nasty. And when an undercover death squad from the singer&#39;s home country is spotted, the Feds think they&#39;re planning an assassination. But Walker isn&#39;t so sure. His client is involved in a lot more than just music, and all of it&#39;s deadly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
