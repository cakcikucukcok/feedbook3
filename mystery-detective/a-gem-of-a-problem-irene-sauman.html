Emma Berry is back at her family&amp;rsquo;s pastoral property, Wirramilla, recovering from the sinking of the paddle steamer &lt;em&gt;Mary B&lt;/em&gt; in the Murray River, in which her husband Sam drowned. Major Barnaby of Honey Hills is demanding the return of a valuable package he claims Sam was carrying for him, and which was apparently lost in the accident. Emma&amp;#39;s brother-in-law, Daniel, co-owner with her of the &lt;em&gt;Mary B&lt;/em&gt;, is blaming her for their misfortune. Emma needs to resolve Sam&amp;rsquo;s troubled legacy and refute the Major&amp;rsquo;s lies and threats. Her search for the package leads her up and down the river and across country, where not everyone she encounters is welcoming and some pay more attention than she finds comfortable, while Major Barnaby&amp;rsquo;s reaction to what she finds is nothing less than life threatening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An Emma Berry Murray River Australia cosy mystery. Includes a sample chapter of Book 2, A Body in the Woodpile. Make sue you get the free ebook prequel Saddled with Death.&lt;br /&gt;
Reviews for first edition. &amp;quot;Well developed with strong characters, the reader is drawn in. I recommend it.&amp;quot; 4 star Amazon Review by Katy, July 8, 2016. &amp;quot;As a historian the author weaves her expert knowledge of era and place into the story with fine detail and transports the reader into the life of early settlers on the banks of the river and the intrigue of the paddle steamer trade...I recommend this book to anyone who loves a &amp;quot;cozy&amp;quot; with a difference and appreciates good storytelling.&amp;quot; 5 star Goodreads review by Helena Holton, Jul 13, 2016. &amp;quot;It was amazing. 1870s Australia might not be a conventional setting for cozy mysteries, but &amp;quot;A Gem of a Problem&amp;quot; shows exactly how well suited it is. The backdrop of pastoral Australia is beautifully written to bring out its charms and challenges, evocative of the era and with uniquely Australian characters.&amp;quot; 5 star Goodreads review by Jacquie Garton-Smith, 12 July 2016. &amp;quot;Such a great read...In a theatre situation [Major Barnaby] is the one you boo and throw stuff at.&amp;quot; Facebook Recent Reads review by Judy Borrett, 20 July 2016.&lt;/p&gt;" />
