  <title>Dead Man&#39;s Puzzle - Parnell Hall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sherry is off on her honeymoon when Chief Harper comes to Cora Felton, asking her to solve a crossword puzzle found on the body of Old Man Overmeyer. Small problem. Cora is the Milli Vanilli of cruciverbalists. Her niece, Sherry, writes the crossword puzzle column for her. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cora pokes into Overmeyer&#39;s death, hoping to prove he died of natural causes. She learns the cranky hermit was the sole surviving member of a forty-year-old stock pooling agreement, and before she can say &quot;capital gain,&quot; the town is full of heirs. Complicating things is Sherry&#39;s ex-husband, Dennis, who is playing detective in the hopes of impressing his ex-wife. With Sherry out of town, her restraining order against him is moot, and he is taking full advantage of the fact. &lt;br&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Dead Man&#39;s Puzzle&lt;/i&gt;, Parnell Hall delivers another stellar, puzzle-packed entry in his entertaining Puzzle Lady series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
