  <title>Night Corridor - Joan Hall Hovey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After nine years in Bayshore mental institution, once called the lunatic asylum, Caroline Hill is finally being released. There will be no one to meet her. Her parents who brought her here…are dead. They have found her a room in a rooming house, a job washing dishes in a restaurant. She will do fine, they said. But no one told that women in St. Simeon are already dying at the hands of a vicious predator. One, an actress who lived previously in her building. And others. 
And now, as Caroline struggles to survive on the outside, she realizes someone is stalking her. But who will believe her? She&#39;s a crazy woman after all. Then, one cold winter&#39;s night on her way home from her job, a man follows and is about to assault her when a stranger intercedes. A stranger who hides his face and whispers her name." />
