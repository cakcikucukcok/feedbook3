  <title>And Now You Must Die! - Michael Ph.D Markey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="World famous author and former police lieutenant T.M.Drake struggles with an agonizing literary dry spell after his wife&amp;#39;s fatal bout with cancer in 1998. Now a widower in July of 2002, he battles with life itself, as well as the business of composition. Not a creative sentence on paper for months. That is, until Friday night, when neighbor Nicole Banks dies in a fiery explosion at her home one block down the street. The result of defective plumbing? Lana Sands, her workmate at a local fitness center, insists that an unknown assailant murdered the lovely young widow - and Miss Sands fears she will be next. In this fortuitous twist of fate, Tom (Drake) and Lana become personally (and romantically) involved as they delve into the cause of Miss Banks&amp;#39; demise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Questions (and bodies) mount and their lives curiously resemble one of Drake&amp;#39;s recent best sellers. Who is the second victim discovered in the rubble of that explosion, and why is he there? When Nicky&amp;#39;s married suitor dies a few days later, is this another accident - or murder? What about the death of Nicole&amp;#39;s analyst not long after the other &amp;#39;mishaps&amp;#39;? And finally, do these events have anything to do with the fact that Mrs. Banks&amp;#39; husband perished in the World Trade Center Tragedy the previous year?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So many questions emerge over such a few days in the placid world of Tom&amp;#39;s home town: York, Pennsylvania. The answers change his life forever, in this tale of healing and renewal for Thomas Michael Drake." />
