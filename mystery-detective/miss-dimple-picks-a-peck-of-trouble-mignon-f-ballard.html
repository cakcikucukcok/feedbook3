  <title>Miss Dimple Picks a Peck of Trouble - Mignon F. Ballard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the summer of 1944 and the world seems mired in a war that will never end. On the home front, the people of Elderberry, Georgia, are doing everything they can to support the troops. Even with a war on, the peaches are ripe for picking. As veteran teacher Miss Dimple Kilpatrick and her colleagues work in the orchard, they hear frantic calls for help: An eighteen-year-old girl, Prentice, has been missing--and is later found murdered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miss Dimple and her fellow teachers-turned-sleuths are determined to find the killer. Although Prentice had recently broken up with her boyfriend, the most obvious suspect isn&#39;t always the right one: Prentice may have been keeping some secrets; and a local woman claims to have witnessed the whole abduction--except she also believes she is Scarlett O&#39;Hara, that Nazi spies are pursuing her, and that she knows where the Confederate gold is buried. Figuring out what really happened to Prentice is sure to be a challenge. But Miss Dimple, who has taught the town&#39;s first graders for decades, has never been daunted by a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mignon F. Ballard&#39;s newest edition to her Miss Dimple mystery series, &lt;i&gt;Miss Dimple Picks a Peck of Trouble, &lt;/i&gt;is filled with period charm and a wonderfully brave band of amateur sleuths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
