  <title>Beyond Revenge - Godfrey Wray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beyond Revenge is a compelling, complex story of a young woman betrayed by the man she loved. Its a riveting tale with its genesis in a quiet Amerindian village in Guyanas interior. Then it snakes its way to a stunningly dramatic conclusion, in the process embracing several genressuspense, romance, science fiction, and drama.
In his fast-paced debut novel, Godfrey Wray captures the essence of storytelling and glues readers to their seats with the intriguing twists and turns that remind one of the more accomplished authors. Its a tale without the obligatory violence and mayhem that many writers in these times use to nauseating effect.
A well-trained female officer in the Guyana Defence Force is sent on an international mission to New York. She is forced to abandon mission headquarters after learning of a plot to tamper with her brain cells. However, before she leaves the Big Apple, she is raped in a Brooklyn park by three men.
Ruth Elizabeth Ferreira, a super athlete and scholar nurtured by a Catholic priest, exacts revenge on the three miscreants before returning to her South American homeland to deal with her duplicitous lover, who had engineered the conspiracy with his CIA counterparts.
In this first book, the author displays a remarkable insight into the fiction world, skillfully embodying moving sequences based on human emotions. His racy style and refreshing narrative power immediately position him above the fray.
This gale force is one the Caribbean and the wider world will be sure to welcome." />
