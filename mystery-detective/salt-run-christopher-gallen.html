  <title>Salt Run - Christopher Gallen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Luke Fisher surfs by morning and attends classes at Flagler College by day.  He passes out at the ghastly sight of what he finds on the beach one morning, and quickly becomes the prime suspect in a crime that rocks the college and the small town community of St. Augustine, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When former Maine state judge Rick Derlax&#39;s &quot;do the crime, do the time&quot; philosophy catches up with him, he escapes to the small coastal town to begin a new career as a professor. &quot;The Judge&quot; has a passion for teaching justice at all costs, but instead is handed his own sentence in a &quot;crime against humanity.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salvador Deaz, a released convict who is frustrated by his small-time drug trafficking, finds himself dealing with a madcap cast of characters that only the backdrop of northern Florida culture can provide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gallen keeps handing you plot lines that keep you guessing and laughing at the same time. Colorful characters, fast-paced dialogue and memorable absurdities make this dark comedy of errors a great read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like the works of Carl Hiaasen, Tim Dorsey, and John MacDonald, you&#39;ll love this intensely fun read from new author Chris Gallen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
