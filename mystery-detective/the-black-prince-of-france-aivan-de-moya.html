  <title>The Black Prince of France - Aivan de Moya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the middle of the night, New York policeman Scott Dewitt answers a desperate phone call from his sister Larissa, who is living in Paris. Her boyfriend Claude has abruptly disappeared, and she can convince no one that foul play may be involved. 
Scott rushes to her and discovers the couple has become involved in a sinister conspiracy dating back centuries. Scott learns that the story of the Man in the Iron Mask is more than just a classic novel. It is a long-unsolved mystery at the center of a blackmail plot threatening the oldest, richest and most powerful families of Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt; 
Scott and Larissa must unveil the identity of the famous anonymous prisoner to find the missing man and save their own lives. They chase down a trail of clues, hidden messages and enigmatic symbols across France, England, Monaco, Italy, Switzerland and the Vatican, all the while pursued by a band of shadowy assassins. They discover shocking revelations about the crowned heads of Europe while fighting to survive.&lt;/p&gt; 
Inspired by true events, and based on extensive historical and scholarly research, the Black Prince of France takes the reader on a thrilling quest from the halls of 17th century palaces to the midst of a modern secret society. It is a plot deeper than the Da Vinci Code and darker than the Lost Symbol. It is the actual solution to the mystery of the Man in the Iron MaskLearn the lengths to which the elite will go in order to ensure that their secrets, no matter how ancient, will remain secret!" />
