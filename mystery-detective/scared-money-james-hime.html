  <title>Scared Money - James Hime</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When the CIA comes knocking at ex-Texas Ranger Jeremiah Spur&#39;s door, asking for a favor, he&#39;s not that interested in helping.  At least, not until the agent mentions that the man-Benjamin Farkas-who needs help requested Jeremiah specifically because he knew Jeremiah&#39;s father.  Since Jeremiah hasn&#39;t seen his father since he was a little boy, this piques his interest, and he reluctantly agrees to travel from his ranch in tiny Brenham, Texas, to the big city-Austin-in order to investigate the disappearance of an accountant, who has vanished along with $10 million of his boss&#39;s money.  The fact that Farkas was once a CIA-trained button man makes him uncomfortable, but the question of his father&#39;s connection means he can&#39;t say no.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Deputy Sheriff Clyde Thomas-a black man in a rural Texas jurisdiction who worked with Jeremiah on the last murder case to hit Brenham-is looking into the shooting deaths of a local drug dealer and his girlfriend, a violent and nasty crime for the usually quiet town.  Clyde&#39;s working theory is that it&#39;s a message in a battle over drug territory, but there are a lot of questions.  It seems unlikely that Captain Spur&#39;s case and Deputy Thomas&#39;s case are related.  But in all things criminal, even in sleepy Brenham, Texas, things are rarely what they seem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scared Money&lt;/i&gt;-explosive, sharp, taut, and atmospheric-is the second book to feature Jeremiah and Clyde, after James Himes&#39; acclaimed first novel, &lt;i&gt;The Night of the Dance&lt;/i&gt;, which was a finalist for the Edgar Award for best first novel of the year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
