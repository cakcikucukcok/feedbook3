  <title>Wild Turkey - Michael Hemmingson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Phil Landsdale has problems. He&#39;s out of a job, heis son&#39;s a pyromaniac, and his wife is running out of excuses as to why she comes home from work every night six hours late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his newly appointed house-husband position, Phil decides he has plenty of time to figure things out. And he learns when you have a lot of time on your hands, you begin to notice your neighbors, intricate nuances, and the upset balance if someone doesn&#39;t follow the same routine. . . . Like the long and sexy neighbor across the street, Cassandra Payne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s been keeping tabs on Cassandra with his new-found friend, Bryan, an ex-detective who lives next door. But when Cassandra&#39;s husband is gunned down en route from the airport, Phil and Bryan realize that beautiful Cassandra might be hiding more beneath that insee-weensy miniskirt than meets the eye. When the two go to investigate a stranger lurking around the Payne house, Bryan is almost killed and Phil finds himself drawn into the dark and mysterious world of Cassandra Payne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a bottle of bourbon and a full tank of gas, Phil sets out to find the gunman and discovers the truth in a world where some men are men, some are wild, and some only a turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
