  <title>O&#39; Artful Death - Sarah Stewart Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Newcomer Sarah Stewart Taylor delivers a compelling and atmospheric cozy mystery that introduces Sweeney St. George, an art historian in Boston with a special interest in the art of death. Sweeney becomes interested in Byzantium, Vermont, an art colony that flourished in the late nineteenth century, when she comes upon a photograph of the striking gravestone of a girl who drowned, and may have been murdered, in 1890. The stone is in a tiny cemetery surrounded by other beautiful, if unremarkable, headstones, some dating back hundreds of years. But the unsigned sculpture that marks this young woman&#39;s grave is of extremely high quality and the artist is unrecognizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney is soon hooked, not only on the mystery of who created the beautiful sculpture but also on the details of the events surrounding the girl&#39;s death. When the friend who showed her the gravestone invites Sweeney to visit his relatives in Byzantium for Christmas, she jumps at the chance, knowing full well that the girl&#39;s murder has achieved the status of mythology in the town and hoping she&#39;ll be able to uncover new information. But by the time they arrive, her interest in the girl and the sculpture has gotten around town and, in fact, seems to have disturbed a killer. For not long after Sweeney arrives, one of the girl&#39;s descendants is murdered, shot and left lying in the cemetery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor has written a remarkably accomplished debut mystery in the traditional cozy vein, and she&#39;s sure to win over legions of fans with&lt;i&gt; O&#39; Artful Death&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
