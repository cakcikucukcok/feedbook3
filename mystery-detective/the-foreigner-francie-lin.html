  <title>The Foreigner - Francie Lin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the Edgar速 Award for Best First Novel by an American Author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Set against the Taiwanese criminal underworld, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Foreigner &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;is Francie Lin&#39;s audacious debut novel. A noirish tale about family, fraternity, conscience, and the curious gulf between a man&#39;s culture and his deepest self&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Emerson Chang is a mild mannered bachelor on the cusp of forty, a financial analyst in a neatly pressed suit, a child of Taiwanese immigrants who doesn&#39;t speak a word of Chinese, and, well, a virgin. His only real family is his mother, whose subtle manipulations have kept him close--all in the name of preserving an obscure idea of family and culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when his mother suddenly dies, Emerson sets out for Taipei to scatter her ashes, and to convey a surprising inheritance to his younger brother, Little P. Now enmeshed in the Taiwanese criminal underworld, Little P seems to be running some very shady business out of his uncle&#39;s karaoke bar, and he conceals a secret--a crime that has not only severed him from his family, but may have annihilated his conscience. Hoping to appease both the living and the dead, Emerson isn&#39;t about to give up the inheritance until he uncovers Little P&#39;s past, and saves what is left of his family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Foreigner &lt;/i&gt;is a darkly comic tale of crime and contrition, and a riveting story about what it means to be a foreigner--even in one&#39;s own family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
