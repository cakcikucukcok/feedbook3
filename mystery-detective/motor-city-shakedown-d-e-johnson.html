  <title>Motor City Shakedown - D. E. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detroit, 1911. Seven months have passed since Will Anderson&#39;s friend Wesley McRae was brutally murdered and Will and the woman he loves, Elizabeth Hume, barely escaped with their lives. Will&#39;s hand, horribly disfigured from the sulfuric acid he used to help save them, causes him constant pain, forcing him into a morphine addiction. He lives for nothing except revenge against the people who contributed to Wesley&#39;s murder--first among them crime boss Vito Adamo. When Will stumbles upon the bloody body of Adamo&#39;s driver, he knows he&#39;ll be a suspect, particularly since he was spotted outside the dead man&#39;s apartment that same night. He sets out to find the killer, and the trail leads him to a vast conspiracy in an underworld populated by gangsters, union organizers, crooked cops, and lawyers. Worse, it places him directly in the middle of Detroit&#39;s first mob war. The Teamsters want a piece of Will&#39;s father&#39;s car company, Detroit Electric, and the Gianolla gang is there to be sure they get it. To save their families, Will and his ex-fiancée Elizabeth Hume enlist the help of Detroit Police Detective Riordan, the teenage members of what will one day be known as the Purple Gang, and Vito Adamo himself. They careen from one danger to the next, surviving shootouts, kidnappings, and police brutality, while barreling toward a devastating climax readers won&#39;t soon forget.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
