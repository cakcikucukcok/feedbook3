  <title>SPQR X: A Point of Law - John Maddox Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Being under suspicion of murder did not hamper my freedom. This is because Romans are civilized people and don&#39;t clap suspects into prison like barbarians do. It would take an order of a lawfully convened court even to place me under house arrest.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s Decius Caecilius Metellus speaking---&lt;i&gt;Senator &lt;/i&gt;Decius Caecilius Metellus, please. He is at an outdoor rally in Rome where he is campaigning for election to the praetorship. It looks like a shoo-in, until a man named Fulvius, of whom Decius has never heard, arrives at the preelection proceedings with a small army of hoodlums and begins to shout to the assembled voters that Decius is a thief and worse. While this is not an unknown effort used to ruin a candidate&#39;s chances, it is enough to have Decius&#39;s father call a meeting of family and friends--a meeting that ends with the participants going home determined to find some answers to stop Fulvius&#39;s efforts to ruin Decius&#39;s chances. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early the next morning, however, as Decius and his friends are on their way to the trial, Fulvius&#39;s body is found slashed to death on the steps of the basilica, where the court will be sitting. And that doesn&#39;t look good for our hero.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those readers who have met Decius before, the next step is clear: the man is a brilliant detective, and he is certainly now in a position where that skill is needed. So it&#39;s doubly important for Decius, with the help of his wife, Julia, and the ex-slave Hermes, to find the solution to the most personal---and possibly most difficult---puzzle that has come his way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
