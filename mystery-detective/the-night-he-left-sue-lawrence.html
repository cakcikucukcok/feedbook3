  <title>The Night He Left - Sue Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At 7pm on 28th December 1879 a violent storm batters the newly-built iron rail bridge across the River Tay, close to the city of Dundee. Ann Craig, a wealthy woman, is waiting for her husband, a mill owner, to return home. From her window she sees the bridge collapse, the train he is travelling on ploughing into the sea, killing all those on board. As Ann investigates the events leading up to the crash, doubt is cast on whether Robert was on the train after all. If not, where is he, and who is the mysterious woman who is first to be washed ashore?
In the present day, Fiona Craig&#39;s new partner Pete, an Australian restaurateur, clears their joint bank account before abandoning his car at Dundee Airport and disappearing. When the Police discover his car is stolen, Fiona conducts her own investigation into Pete&#39;s background, slowly uncovering dark secrets and strange parallels with the events of 1879. 
Following on from her acclaimed debut Fields of Blue Flax, chef, food writer and TV presenter Sue Lawrence serves up another brilliant historical mystery, meticulously researched and densely plotted, with plenty of twists and turns and a gripping climax. 
&#39;I found this book enthralling. It&#39;s a cracking story beautifully told.&#39; Lorraine Kelly, broadcaster
&#39;A very enjoyable read… and a fascinating insight into the history of Dundee’s famous bridge disaster.&#39; Kirsten McKenzie, author of The Chapel at the End of the World" />
