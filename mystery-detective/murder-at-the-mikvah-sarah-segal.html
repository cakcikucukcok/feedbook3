  <title>Murder at the Mikvah - Sarah Segal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mikvah: A body of water used for ritual immersion in Judaism.&lt;p&gt;
An attack at a local mikvah rocks a small Jewish community, leaving a holocaust survivor dead and the wife of a popular rabbi clinging to life. Peter Stem, a reclusive church employee has been arrested at the scene and taken into custody in what appears to be an anti-Semitic attack against two helpless women. Advocating for Peter is his employer, Father Herbert McCormick, a blind priest, who refuses to believe Peter capable of this or any crime. Using his personal relationship with John Collins, the arresting officer whom he has counseled in the past, Father McCormick steers the investigation in a new direction, one that requires the help of a renowned psychiatrist-a man who has a growing interest in both Peter&#39;s case and the Rabbi&#39;s mother-and will ultimately reveal a bigger secret than any of them could have imagined." />
