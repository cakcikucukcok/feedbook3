  <title>Blood Tango - Annamaria Alfieri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is the most dramatic and tumultuous period in Argentina&#39;s history. Colonel Juan Perón, who had been the most powerful and the most hated man in the country, has been forced out of power. Many people fear that his mistress, radio actress Evita Duarte, will use her skill at swaying the masses to restore him to office. When an obscure young woman is brutally murdered, police detective Roberto Leary concludes that the murderer mistook the girl for Evita, the intended target of someone out to eliminate the popular star from the political scene. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The search for the killer soon involves the murdered girl&#39;s employer, who is Evita&#39;s dressmaker; her journalist lover; and Pilar, a seamstress in the dress shop and a tango dancer. The suspects include a leftist union leader who considers Juan Perón a fascist and a young lieutenant who feels Perón has dishonored the army. Their stories collide in this thrilling and sensuous historical mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annamaria Alfieri&#39;s historical mysteries set in South America paint a vivid portrait of life at the time, in which the characters&#39; motivations--love, fear, and ambition--all compete to create an evocative tale. &lt;i&gt;Blood Tango&lt;/i&gt; is her finest achievement yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
