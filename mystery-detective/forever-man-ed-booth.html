  <title>Forever Man - Ed Booth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year is AD 100, and in the cruel lands between Rome and the Cold Sea, an orphan boy meets a man named John the Revelatora man who will change his life forever. John speaks with the power of Christ, and the orphan finds the conversation fascinating. John finds a kindred spirit in the young boy, made even more apparent when John hands the mantle of Christ off to the young man and dubs him Christian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his newfound title, Christian begins to realize that time and decay no longer touch him. Unlike other men of his world, Christian does not appear to age. Perhaps he is even incapable of dying. He sets off into harsh outer lands, spreading the word of Christ, as John instructed. It is during his travels that Christian comes upon the Lord at the edge of an abyss; only then does he discover his true purpose, in the name of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Christian will stand as witness to mankind, until Christ returns to Earth. A historian of sorts, Christians life will span generations; he will act as exhorter and witness, awaiting the Lords arrival. As Christian comes to terms with his new existence, a battle of good versus evil rages nearby. Will Christian enter the battle? Is he really incapable of death? Or will Christs return come much sooner than planned?&lt;/p&gt;" />
