  <title>True Vermilion - George Bixley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t mess with the hothead&amp;mdash;or he might just mess with you. Slater Ib&amp;aacute;&amp;ntilde;ez is only interested in two kinds of guys: the ones he wants to punch, and the ones he sleeps with. Things get interesting when they start to overlap. A freelance investigator, Slater trolls the dark side of Los Angeles, rooting out insurance fraud, not afraid to use whatever means necessary to get things done, and not about to hold back with his fists. A queer antihero for a new age, Slater walks the line between ordinary life and the frayed fringes of society, keeping his balance with the jobs that his employer, Della, throws his way, and the back-channel support he gets from his idiot cop ex-boyfriend, Conrad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hired to look into the theft of an expensive piece of jewelry, Slater soon finds himself entangled with a delusional high-end clothing manufacturer who sees the good in everyone, his snooty socialite wife, described as &amp;ldquo;damaged,&amp;rdquo; and her book-smart smoking-hot stepson. Which one of them is lying to Slater&amp;mdash;and who, exactly, is the slippery con artist in the red miniskirt? From his new digs in the Fashion District, and with the help of a new business partner, Slater stalks wealthy lowlifes and their minions in boutiques and clubs, breaking into places he&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be, winding up the middle of the desert in the middle of the night&amp;mdash;and never hesitating to serve up a beatdown.&lt;/p&gt;" />
