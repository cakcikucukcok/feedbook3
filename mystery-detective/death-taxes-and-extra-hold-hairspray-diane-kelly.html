  <title>Death, Taxes, and Extra-Hold Hairspray - Diane Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you&#39;re an agent for the IRS, it&#39;s always tax time. And this season, Tara Holloway is up to her neck in work with two very knotty cases. One involves a charismatic minister who&#39;s using his mega-church as a tax shelter. The other is a crazy militant who&#39;s trying to turn Texas into a separate country. With her boyfriend out of town and her partner reassigned, Tara is on her own--and things are getting hairy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;If dealing with the Lone Star State isn&#39;t enough, Tara has other new issues to take into account: There&#39;s a sexy new agent named Nick, who&#39;s got her head in the clouds...and Tara&#39;s boss, Lu, who&#39;s having a hair problem of epic proportions: not even her Chinese contraband industrial-strength hairspray is enough to keep her signature strawberry blonde beehive from falling flat. Can Tara help Lu find a wig--and keep from wigging out over Nick? Love, updos, taxes--this time, Tara&#39;s got a whole lot of kinks to iron out...&lt;/p&gt;" />
