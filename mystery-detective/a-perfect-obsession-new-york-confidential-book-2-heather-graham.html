      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect&lt;/em&gt; suspense from &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Heather Graham! The latest book in her New York Confidential series.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Someone is murdering beautiful young women in the New York area and displaying them in mausoleums and underground tombs. The FBI is handling the case, with Special Agent Craig Frasier as lead.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Kieran Finnegan, forensic psychologist and part owner of Finnegan&#39;s, her family&#39;s pub, is consulting on the case. Craig and Kieran are a couple who&#39;ve worked together on more than one occasion. On this occasion, though, Craig fears for the safety of the woman he loves. Because the killer is too close. The body of a young model is found in a catacomb under a two-hundred-year-old church, now deconsecrated and turned into a nightclub. A church directly behind Finnegan&#39;s in lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As more women are murdered, their bodies discovered in underground locations in New York, it&#39;s clear that the police and the FBI are dealing with a serial killer. Craig and Kieran are desperate to track down the murderer, a man obsessed with female perfection. Obsessed enough to want to &quot;preserve&quot; that beauty by destroying the women who embody it…&lt;/p&gt;
