  <title>A Memorable Murder - John Schlarbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Memorable Murder&lt;br&gt;A Jennifer Malone Mystery&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Payback&amp;#39;s a bitch . . . in a blue and white dress&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On a cool October morning, viewers are transfixed to their televisions for details of a gangland-style murder carried out during the live broadcast of The Nation Today. Upon identifying the dead man as Robert Barker, CEO of the country&amp;#39;s largest pharmaceutical company, the police quickly discover clues indicating the killer is none other than his wife, Lynn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While authorities attempt to locate Mrs. Barker, intrepid newspaper reporter Jennifer Malone uncovers information the shooting is possibly related to a new memory wonder drug. Yet the harder she digs, the more twists and turns she unearths. Had Robert found out about Lynn&amp;#39;s affair with the presidential candidate - a show guest that fateful morning? Or was it business related, as the candidate is the powerful Chairman of the Health and Welfare Committee that oversees the drug industry?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Memorable Murder is a story of greed, revenge, political cover-up, and a country&amp;#39;s insatiable appetite for tabloid-worthy news stories.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is also a novel you won&amp;#39;t soon forget." />
