  <title>Rebellion - Kenneth John Marks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Using his strong background in the Scripture mixed with a complex and rich imagination, Kenneth John Marks sets out to tell a dramatic but biblically rooted account of evils origin in the universe. He does this largely through childrens perspectives, which adds a layer of wonder and innocence to the narration that contrasts effectively with some of the less-than-innocent characters and dramatic twists. What starts off as a simple tale deepens into a riveting story of evil versus good, Lucifers followers against Gods, which culminates in an unforgettable battle between Lucifer as a seven-headed dragon and the Destroyer that burns and pierces him. Readers will enjoy the authors skillful story telling and poetic prose, such as the noonday sun reached with bright shining fingers. Even more importantly, many readers will see their faith and life choices mirrored in the characters, inspiring prayerful self-examination and reflection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
