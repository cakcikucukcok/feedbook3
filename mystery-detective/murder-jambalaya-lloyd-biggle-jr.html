  <title>Murder Jambalaya - Lloyd Biggle Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="?My missing person did not hunt, fish, or engage in any type of sport that one would do in a Louisiana fishing village. And after a cursory look at what was called Pointe Nueve, I doubted a decent antique could be found to buy in the entire collection of rusty, metal-roofed buildings. At least I knew not to expect to find a body there. The alligators would have taken care of that weeks ago. OK, so I can be wrong once in a while...?&lt;P&gt;Louisiana antique dealer Marc DeVarney, a well-respected businessman, has suddenly gone missing, and J. Pletcher and Raina Lambert, investigative consultants, are hired by his family to locate the man--or his remains. Their quest sends them scurrying through the area around New Orleans, from the wealthy mansions of the Garden District to the swamps and bayous of small, nearby fishing villages. With the aid of a unique cast of New Orleans characters, including a licensed witch, a game warden, local ?royalty,? a brilliant attorney, flea market vendors, and assorted street people, they must sort through a myriad of deceptions to confront the twisted evil secrets of the past. A marvelously evocative mystery thriller." />
