Jance&amp;#8217;s most acclaimed series characters, join forces for the first time in one of the most suspenseful works of her career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Years ago, Amos Warren, a prospector, was gunned down out in the desert and Sheriff Brandon Walker made the arrest in the case. Now, the retired Walker is called in when the alleged killer, John Lassiter, refuses to accept a plea deal that would release him from prison with time served. Lassiter wants Brandon and The Last Chance to find Amos&amp;#39;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; killer and clear his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sixteen hundred miles to the north in Seattle, J.P. Beaumont is at loose ends after the Special Homicide Investigation Team, affectionately known as S.H.I.T., has been unexpectedly and completely disbanded.
