  <title>Stabscotch, The San Francisco Mystery Series, Book 3 - Alexi Venice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Detective Tommy Vietti isn&amp;#39;t happy about being interrupted on a Sunday morning while in bed with his new girlfriend, Sadie. He reluctantly leaves her for Muir Beach to inspect the murder scene of Jina Pak, a cyber security analyst for the Federal Reserve Bank. At least she was, until someone slit her throat as she sat by a campfire.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tommy expects the Feds to take the case from him since it involves an employee of such a high-profile, international institution. Instead, they send Roxy MacNeil&amp;ndash;a Scottish banking expert&amp;ndash;to co-investigate with him. Smoking her cigarettes, using vulgar language and drinking Scotch, Roxy gives the impression that she&amp;#39;s a sluff-off. However, Tommy notices that things aren&amp;#39;t quite what they seem when Roxy is around.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;District Attorney Amanda Hawthorne nurses her battle scars from her war with the Italian mob, wondering if she should have a baby, like her fiancÃ©e, Dr. Jen Dawson. As they consider who might be the perfect sperm donor, Amanda must turn her attention to Tommy and Roxy&amp;#39;s murder investigation as well as campaign for re-election to the DA position.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Juggling her busy clinical practice and raising a child, Jen Dawson is by Amanda&amp;#39;s side at campaign events. She can handle Amanda being a semi-celebrity, having a ton of old girlfriends, and even being hit on by strangers at events like the Dyke March. Roxy MacNeil, however, is Jen&amp;#39;s worst nightmare. Beautiful. Mysterious. Smart. Sexy. And powerful. As far as Jen knows, Roxy is more powerful than Amanda, and Amanda is drawn to power like a dog to raw meat.&lt;br&gt;" />
