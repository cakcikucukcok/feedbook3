  <title>Last Chance - A. W. Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The men and women of the Chicago Police Department are a tight-knit family, so when one splinter group within starts targeting gay officers, justice must be served. Some officers are threatened, and others are killed, creating a scandal that rocks the department and the city. The officer known as WolfCaptain Jonathan Wolfgang Wilhelmis the one credited with shutting down the Blue Society once and for all. Everyone breathes a sigh of relief knowing that this group has finally been brought to justice.
After the excitement and danger of the biggest case of his career, Wolf quickly grows bored. He decides its finally time to turn in his badge and settle into retirement. He marries the woman of his dreamshis partner, Jeriand they move to a quiet lake community, ready to enjoy their days. But just when he thinks life is about to return to normal, Wolf gets a harrowing phone call. The Blue Society, the caller informs him, is still very much aliveand looking for its own brand of justice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When he hears that Becky Stiller, a student at Northern University, has been abducted, Wolf reluctantly agrees to come in as a consultant on the case. Is there a link between the Stiller case and the Blue Society? Wolf must now decipher a tantalizing set of clues to get the answers and the justice he seeks.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For both Wolf and the lone face of Blue Society, this is the last chance. Who will survive?&lt;/p&gt;" />
