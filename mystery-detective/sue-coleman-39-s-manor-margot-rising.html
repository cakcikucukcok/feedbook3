  <title>Sue Coleman&#39;s Manor - Margot Rising</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wouldn&#39;t you like to inherit property from a relative you hardly knew? Thirty-two year old SUSAN COLEMAN now owns a condo in Scarletville, and cabin, both inherited from her uncle. On her way to the parking lot one night, she is mugged, but is saved by DR. JASON ENGLER. A mystery unfolds with surprising developments.&lt;/p&gt;
Sue needs her newly acquired job to pay for the taxes on both places. When she goes to see the cabin, she expects to find a log cabin and hopes it has running water and plumbing. Instead, she finds a mansion, rumored to be haunted. A mystery unfolds with surprising developments as they try to prove there are no ghosts.&lt;/p&gt;
Jason brings his youth group to the haunted mansion to help find the origin of the screams that are heard at midnight. Sue and Jason try to find out what Sue&#39;s uncle had intended to do with the mansion, which he&#39;d purchased intending to use it as an orphanage.&lt;/p&gt;
A romance blooms not only between Sue and Jason, but Jason&#39;s housekeeper surprises them with a man who turns out to be more than a friend." />
