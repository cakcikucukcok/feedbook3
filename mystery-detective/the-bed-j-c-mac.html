  <title>The Bed - J.C.Mac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After failing to buy a discarded bed frame from the old woman, Steven, a newly found friend of Cindy stole   and gave the same to Cindy who was lured by the beauty of its excellent craftsmanship on the carvings.  Unaware, Cindy has rekindled the embers of the spirits trapped inside that once feed and dwell in it.  In a peculiar change of events, her nice and wonderful dreams turned into frightening nightmares haunting her every time she lays on her bed.  One of her frightening nightmares brought her back to the origin of the bed where hundredths of blood literally poured and nourished the tree where the lumber for the bed was taken. Amidst the nightmare troubles shes experiencing, Cindy was also in a love triangle involving his childhood friend Aaron and his girlfriend Suzy. As the latter discovered the affair of the two, plots were hatched and done which only fuel the flame that already started." />
