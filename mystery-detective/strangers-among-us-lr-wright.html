      <meta name="description" content="Vancouver’s “Sunshine Coast” is one of Canada’s famous beautyspots, but as fans of LR Wright’s books know, it harbors eleventyseven versions of crazy. On offer here is the adolescent variety: Eliot Gardener is maddeningly sullen as only an angry fourteenyearold can be. He’s also, apparently, a doublemurderer, having whacked both of his parents with a machete. There’s little question that Eliot did the deed, but for Sergeant Karl Alberg it feels like a personal failure: The Coast is his patch, and he should have seen the trouble coming. He’s getting ready to marry his longtime sweetheart, but the guilt is poisoning his joy – so much so that when a second killer seems to have Alberg in his sights, the threat feels almost justified." />
