  <title>A Most Peculiar Malaysian Murder - Shamini Flint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet Inspector Singh: a fat, slightly bumbling, but truly lovable detective sure to charm readers of &lt;i&gt;The No.1 Ladies Detective Agency&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspector Singh is in a bad mood. He&#39;s been sent from his home in Singapore to Kuala Lumpur to solve a murder that has him stumped. Chelsea Liew--the famous Singaporean model--is on death row for the murder of her ex-husband. She swears she didn&#39;t do it, he thinks she didn&#39;t do it, but no matter how hard he tries to get to the bottom of things, he still arrives back at the same place--that Chelsea&#39;s husband was shot at point blank range, and that Chelsea had the best motivation to pull the trigger: he was taking her kids away from her. Now Inspector Singh must pull out all the stops to crack a crime that could potentially free a beautiful and innocent woman and reunite a mother with her children. There&#39;s just one problem--the Malaysian police refuse to play ball.&lt;/p&gt;" />
