  <title>The One Man - Andrew Gross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;As moving as it is gripping. A winner on all fronts.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Booklist&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Heart-pounding...This is Gross&#39;s best work yet, with his heart and soul imprinted on every page.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt; (starred review)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poland. 1944. Alfred Mendl and his family are brought on a crowded train to a Nazi concentration camp after being caught trying to flee Paris with forged papers. His family is torn away from him on arrival, his life&#39;s work burned before his eyes. To the guards, he is just another prisoner, but in fact Mendl--a renowned physicist--holds knowledge that only two people in the world possess. And the other is already at work for the Nazi war machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four thousand miles away, in Washington, DC, Intelligence lieutenant Nathan Blum routinely decodes messages from occupied Poland. Having escaped the Krakow ghetto as a teenager after the Nazis executed his family, Nathan longs to do more for his new country in the war. But never did he expect the proposal he receives from &quot;Wild&quot; Bill Donovan, head of the OSS: to sneak into the most guarded place on earth, a living hell, on a mission to find and escape with one man, the one man the Allies believe can ensure them victory in the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bursting with compelling characters and tense story lines, this historical thriller from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller Andrew Gross is a deeply affecting, unputdownable series of twists and turns through a landscape at times horrifyingly familiar but still completely new and compelling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
