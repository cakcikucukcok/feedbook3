  <title>Steel Wombs - R. C. Lindholm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cal Larsson is just getting accustomed to life. He receives a phone call from an old classmate, Mark Svendson, who needs him in Sweden. Mark isn&#39;t the one in need of scientific expertise. Instead, a friend of his seeks Cal&#39;s advice. Cal has met this mysterious friend once before. Her name is Dr. Inga Rundstrom, and she&#39;s just as gorgeous as Cal remembers. However, Inga&#39;s secretive nature borders on paranoid, and at times, she seems almost frightened. Her problem involves a laboratory she recently joined. Fueled by Inga&#39;s reluctance to explain the exact nature of the problem, or even the location of the laboratory, Cal gets frustrated but knows the only way to find the truth is to return to her lab to see for himself. Before they reach the lab, though, Cal realizes dangerous people are following them, and his feelings for Inga have only complicated what could quickly become a deadly investigation" />
