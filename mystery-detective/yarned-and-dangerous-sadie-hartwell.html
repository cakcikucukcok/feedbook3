  <title>Yarned and Dangerous - Sadie Hartwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;html&gt;&lt;i&gt;Time has not been kind to sleepy Dorset Falls, Connecticut, where an erstwhile resident is hoping to bring a tattered yarn shop back to life—but with a murderer on the loose, the whole town is in knots . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Josie Blair left Dorset Falls twelve years ago in hopes of making it big in New York City. But after earning an overpriced master’s degree and getting fired by a temperamental designer, she finds herself heading back to her hometown. Her great-uncle was injured in a car accident, and newly unemployed Josie is the only person available to take care of him. Uncle Eb’s wife didn’t survive the crash, so Josie is also tasked with selling the contents of her Aunt Cora’s yarn shop. But the needling ladies of the Charity Knitters Association pose a far bigger challenge than a shop full of scattered skeins . . .&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Miss Marple Knits is one of the few businesses still open in the dreary downtown. Josie can’t imagine how it stayed open for so long, yet something about the cozy, resilient little shop appeals to her. But when one of the town’s most persnickety knitters turns up dead in a pile of cashmere yarn, Josie realizes there’s something truly twisted lurking beneath the town’s decaying façade . . .&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;INCLUDES ORIGINAL KNITTING PATTERNS!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;“A tale of murder and intrigue that will ensnare knitters and non-knitters alike. I couldn’t put it down.”—Barbara Ross&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/html&gt;" />
