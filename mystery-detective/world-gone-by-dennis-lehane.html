Prohibition is dead, the world is at war again, and Joe&amp;#8217;s son, Tom&amp;#225;s, is growing up. Now, the former crime kingpin works as a consigliore to the Bartolo crime family, traveling between Tampa and Cuba, his wife&amp;#8217;s homeland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A master who moves in and out of the black, white, and Cuban underworlds, Joe effortlessly mixes with Tampa&amp;#8217;s social elite, U.S. Naval intelligence, the Lansky-Luciano mob, and the mob-financed government of Fulgencio Batista. He has everything&amp;#8212;money, power, a beautiful mistress, and anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But success cannot protect him from the dark truth of his past&amp;#8212;and ultimately, the wages of a lifetime of sin will finally be paid in full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dennis Lehane vividly recreates the rise of the mob during a world at war, from a masterfully choreographed Ash Wednesday gun battle in the streets of Ybor City to a chilling, heartbreaking climax in a Cuban sugar cane field.
