  <title>Breaking Silence - Linda Castillo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling series hailed as &quot;gripping&quot; (&lt;i&gt;People &lt;/i&gt;magazine) and &quot;compelling&quot; (&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;) returns with Police Chief Kate Burkholder called to the scene of a horrific tragedy on a peaceful Amish farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Slabaugh family are model Amish farmers, prosperous and hardworking, with four children and a happy extended family. When the parents and an uncle are found dead in their barn, it appears to be a gruesome accident: methane gas asphyxiation caused by a poorly ventilated cesspit. But in the course of a routine autopsy, the coroner discovers that one of the victims suffered a head wound before death--clearly, foul play was involved. But who would want to make orphans of the Slabaughs&#39; children? And is this murder somehow related to a recent string of shocking hate crimes against the Amish? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having grown up Amish, Kate is determined to bring the killer to justice. Because the other series of attacks are designated hate crimes, the state sends in agent John Tomasetti, with whom Kate has a long and complex relationship. Together, they search for the link between the crimes--and uncover a dark secret at work beneath the placid surface of this idyllic Amish community. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chock full of twists and chills and set against the unusual world of the Amish, this series &quot;will delight fans of Chelsea Cain and Thomas Harris&quot; (&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;" />
