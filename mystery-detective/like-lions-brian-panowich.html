      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A book filled with unforgettable characters and a tension that heightens with every chapter.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt; A powerful follow up to multiple award-winning debut&lt;i&gt; Bull Mountain&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Brian Panowich burst onto the crime fiction scene in 2015, winning awards and accolades from readers and critics alike for his smoldering debut, &lt;i&gt;Bull Mountain&lt;/i&gt;. Now with &lt;i&gt;Like Lions&lt;/i&gt;, he cements his place as one of the outstanding new voices in crime fiction.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clayton Burroughs is a small-town Georgia sheriff, a new father, and, improbably, the heir apparent of Bull Mountain&#39;s most notorious criminal family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As he tries to juggle fatherhood, his job and his recovery from being shot in the confrontation that killed his two criminally-inclined brothers last year, he&#39;s doing all he can just to survive. Yet after years of carefully toeing the line between his life in law enforcement and his family, he finally has to make a choice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When a rival organization makes a first foray into Burroughs territory, leaving a trail of bodies and a whiff of fear in its wake, Clayton is pulled back into the life he so desperately wants to leave behind. Revenge is a powerful force, and the vacuum left by his brothers&#39; deaths has left them all vulnerable.  With his wife and child in danger, and the way of life in Bull Mountain under siege for everyone, Clayton will need to find a way to bury the bloody legacy of his past once and for all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
