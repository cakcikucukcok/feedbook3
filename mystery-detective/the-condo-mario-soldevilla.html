  <title>The Condo - Mario Soldevilla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After Philip&#39;s daughter is killed in a truck accident, no one is held accountable. His attempt to gain justice through the legal system has failed. Philip, once a nice, mild-mannered guy, now has the poison of revenge in his blood. The only way to obtain justice, is to make them pay; pay - with their lives.   He starts with insurance executives and trial lawyers, doing his best to make everything seem accidental. As his need for vengeance grows, a hurricane inches closer and closer to the Florida peninsula. Miami is bracing itself, and so are Philip&#39;s family lawyer, Tamara, and her husband, Marco.   Tamara is Philip&#39;s last intended victim. Philip stalks her every step, all the way to the front door of her Vero Beach condo. What does it take for a man to become a killer? Is there a killer inside each of us waiting to be unmasked? Miami, beware; a storm is coming." />
