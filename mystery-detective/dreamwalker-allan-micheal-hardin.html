  <title>Dreamwalker - Allan Micheal Hardin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Escaping from a prison work gang, a group of murderous convicts journey through the wilds of the Rocky Mountains during the 1860s gold rush in search of riches beyond their imaginations. The gang&#39;s ruthless leader, Clarence Whitney, forces one of them, Michael George, a young Mtis half-breed, to participate in their mayhem and wanton acts of murder or face death. 
&lt;br&gt;
When Whitney and the gang pillage a native village, taking a village elder hostage, Michael and the elder secretly work together to undermine Whitney and the others. Survivors from the village, including a powerful native shaman, work their ritual magic to exact their own brand of mystical revenge. As Michael, the elder, and the gang come closer to the gold and their uncertain fates, Michael discovers that destiny and supernatural justice have more in store for him than he expected.&lt;br&gt;
Energetically written and brilliantly told, &lt;b&gt;Allan Michael Hardin&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Dreamwalker&lt;/i&gt; is a thrill ride of a book, sometimes terrifying, sometimes inspiring, but always exhilarating. Told with a narrative voice that conveys action and historical authenticity, &lt;i&gt;Dreamwalker&lt;/i&gt; both captivates and entertains without compromising one ounce of excitement." />
