  <title>Billy Blood - Christopher Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A fender-bender on the freeway gets psychic investigator Mason entangled with Catherine, an enigmatic visitor from DC&amp;mdash;but who, exactly, does she work for? Trying to track her down, he runs across Billy Blood, a Los Angeles company that markets a stomach-churning &amp;ldquo;lifestyle drink&amp;rdquo; made with animal blood, and goes to work for its shady CEO to find out who has been vandalizing the product. Recruited by Hanh, an old friend from the psychic world, to rescue a lost colleague, Mason meets an ally with serious dirt on the company, and manages to dredge up some of his own. And why is Catherine so interested in his research work for Billy Blood? Hounded by the media and mortified to see his face on the news, Mason battles a billion-dollar corporation, sharpening his psychic skills and wrestling with a dilemma most of us face at one time or another&amp;mdash;doing what&amp;rsquo;s convenient versus doing what&amp;rsquo;s right.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Backed by his boyfriend, Ned, and their roommate, Peggy, who are almost always willing to help him out, this fourth book in the Mason Braithwaite Paranormal Mystery Series sees the bicycle-commuting detective using his psychic insight, along with a newfound experimental hypnosis technique, on the seedy side of the West Coast entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
