  <title>Footsteps in the Dark - Georgette Heyer</title>

But when a murder victim is discovered in the drafty Priory halls, the once unconcerned trio begins to fear that the ghostly rumors are true and they are not alone after all! With a killer on the loose, will they find themselves the next victims of a supernatural predator, or will they uncover a far more corporeal culprit?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Readers Are Saying:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;One of the best stories Mrs. Heyer ever concocted, and of course written in her own inimitable style, with plenty of wit and dry humor.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Spine-tingling enjoyment.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Georgette Heyer wrote over fifty books, including Regency romances, mysteries, and historical fiction. Her barrister husband, Ronald Rougier, provided many of the plots for her detective novels, which are classic English country house mysteries reminiscent of Agatha Christie.
