  <title>In Dog We Trust - Neil S. Plakcy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="42-year-old Steve Levitan has lost everything that matters to him - his marriage, his home and his career. After finishing a brief prison term for computer hacking, he returns to his home town of Stewart&amp;#39;s Crossing, PA with his tail between his legs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With his parole officer peering over his shoulder, Steve begins a technical writing business and takes a part-time job as an adjunct professor of English at his alma mater, Eastern College. He reconnects with an old friend, the local police detective, hangs out at a coffee shop, and enjoys the natural beauty of Bucks County and the stimulating college environment. Starting over helps him numb the pain of all he&amp;#39;s lost, including the two unborn children his ex-wife miscarried before their divorce.&lt;br /&gt;
The last thing he needs in his life is a shaggy, bossy golden retriever. But when his next-door neighbor, Caroline Kelly, is murdered, Steve becomes her dog&amp;#39;s temporary guardian. Rochester seems determined to solve the mystery of Caroline&amp;#39;s death, digging up clues and pushing Steve to investigate. As they nose through Caroline&amp;#39;s past, her friends and her career searching for motives, the bond between man and dog grows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But it&amp;#39;s only when Steve uncovers a connection between Caroline&amp;#39;s death and some uncomfortable situations between his students and his colleagues that Steve realizes that in order to save his own life, and the life of the dog he&amp;#39;s come to love, he&amp;#39;s going to have to come face to face with a killer with nothing left to lose." />
