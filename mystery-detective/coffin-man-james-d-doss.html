  <title>Coffin Man - James D. Doss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Colorado rancher and part-time tribal investigator Charlie Moon gets a call from Wanda Naranjo, she&#39;s panicked. Not only is her sink leaking, which Moon graciously fixes, but her sixteen-year-old daughter, Betty, has gone missing. For how long? Only a few hours, but she&#39;s pregnant. So what about the father-to-be? It&#39;s a good question and anybody&#39;s guess. Betty has kept her lips sealed on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s not all. Betty claimed to be going to see a school counselor on what turned out to be his day off. So was she running away or was she abducted? Moon&#39;s best friend, Granite Creek Chief of Police Scott Parris, doesn&#39;t believe any of it and suspects that Wanda tricked them into doing a little emergency plumbing. While it&#39;s enough to make Parris&#39;s blood boil, Moon can&#39;t shake the feeling that some other foul play might be at work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James D. Doss&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Coffin Man&lt;/i&gt; is a witty ride through the Wild West that&#39;s chock-full of tall tales, wide-open spaces, and Doss&#39;s signature homespun wit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
