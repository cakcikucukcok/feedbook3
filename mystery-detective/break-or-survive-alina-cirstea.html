  <title>Break or Survive? - Alina Cirstea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twelve-year-old Annis Lovelock is afraid of 
what the future is waiting to bring. Despite disturbing nightmares, messages from a strange voice, and an overwhelming feeling that something is going to happen soon, Annis attempts to go about her pre-teen days plagued by boy problems, an annoying little brother, and homework. But even after her nightmares follow her to Florida as she vacations with her family, Annis has no idea she is about to experience the adventure of a lifetime.
After a series of bizarre events and a horrific storm that leaves her floating in the ocean for twenty-four hours, Annis finds herself on a mysterious island with others whose unfortunate fates match hers. But as her nightmares become worse by the day and beasts stalk the group, Anniss courage is tested in ways she never imagined. Now she is left to question whether she will ever find her way off the island or if she will die trying.
Break or Survive? shares the spellbinding tale of a pre-teens coming-of-age journey as she unwittingly embarks on a dangerous island adventure where she must learn to believe in herself and determine who she can trust." />
