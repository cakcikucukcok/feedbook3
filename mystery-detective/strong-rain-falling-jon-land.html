  <title>Strong Rain Falling - Jon Land</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jon Land&#39;s bestselling series featuring Texas Ranger Caitlin Strong continues in &lt;i&gt;Strong Rain Falling. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mexico, 1919:&lt;/i&gt;  The birth of the Mexican drug trade begins with opium being smuggled across the U.S. border, igniting an all-out battle with American law enforcement in general and the Texas Rangers in particular.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Present:&lt;/i&gt;  Fifth Generation Texas Ranger Caitlin Strong and her lover Cort Wesley Masters both survive terrifying gun battles.  But this time, it turns out, the actual targets were not them, but Masters&#39; teenage sons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sets Caitlin and Cort Wesley off on a trail winding through the past and present with nothing less than the future of the United States hanging in the balance.  Along the way they will confront terrible truths dating all the way back to the Mexican Revolution and the dogged battle Caitlin&#39;s own grandfather and great-grandfather fought against the first generation of Mexican drug dealers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the storm soon to sweep away America as we know it, lies a mastermind whose abundant power is equaled only by her thirst for vengeance.  Ana Callas Guajardo, the last surviving member of the family that founded the Mexican drug trade, has dedicated all of her vast resources to a plot aimed at the U.S.&#39;s technological heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This time out, sabotage proves to be as deadly a weapon as bombs in a battle Caitlin must win in cyberspace as well.  Her only chance to prevail is to short-circuit a complex plan based as much on microchips as bullets.  Because there&#39;s a strong rain coming and only Caitlin and Cort Wesley can stop the fall before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
