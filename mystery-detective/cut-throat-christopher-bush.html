  <title>Cut Throat - Christopher Bush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travers looked down at the face. On the collar was a red patch and a long streak. Across the throat was a gash.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two rival London newspaper tycoons are at daggers drawn. But when Sir William Griffith&amp;rsquo;s corpse turns up in a hamper, his throat cut from ear to ear, the enmity appears to turned deadly. Or is it instead a case of domestic terrorism? Superintendent Wharton of the Yard brings Ludovic Travers into the case and together they investigate a gallery of additional suspects: explorer Tim Griffiths; Sir William&amp;rsquo;s financial secretary, Bland, and his wife; local vicar Reverend Cross; an archetypally sinister butler &amp;hellip; and an intrusive crime reporter, who always seems to find himself in the thick of a crime scene. Wharton and Travers come to believe they have identified their murderer &amp;ndash; but how can they break a cast-iron alibi?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut Throat&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1932. This new edition features an introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
