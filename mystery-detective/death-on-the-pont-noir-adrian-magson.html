  <title>Death on the Pont Noir - Adrian Magson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nothing else mattered. He&#39;d been cut loose by his bosses and his twisted vision of what had happened saw only one ending: revenge. And that revenge was centred solely on Rocco. 1963, France. A farmer reports a truck ramming into a car near Picardie, followed by gunfire. A group of Englishmen are brought in after a bar fight. A tramp&#39;s body is discovered in a burnt out truck. All this occurring after multiple attempts on the President&#39;s life. Inspector Lucas Rocco knows there&#39;s a connection somewhere, and is recruited by Colonel Saint-Cloud to assist with the President&#39;s Security. Yet despite all clues pointing to the Pont Noir for the next attempt, both Massin and Saint-Cloud reject his suspicions. Left with no other option, Rocco decides to investigate the situation alone, risking censure by his superiors. And he must also contend with the lethal response of English gangsters if he should go too far. When the group of Englishmen return to France Rocco finds himself the victim of a set-up, leading to his suspension and investigation for bribery. With no badge, no authority and unsupported, Rocco is still determined to continue his investigation..." />
