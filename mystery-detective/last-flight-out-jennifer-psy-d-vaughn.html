  <title>Last Flight Out - Jennifer Psy.D. Vaughn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ella Sheridan has failed them again. One shortcoming after another, this is just the latest disappointment in what Ella sees as a lifetime spent not measuring up. Her family&amp;#39;s pristine image about to be shattered when the nation learns the vice president&amp;#39;s daughter has cancer. Ignoring her mother&amp;#39;s strict security mandates against commercial travel, Ella books herself on a flight bound for Los Angeles to share her difficult diagnosis first with a trusted friend. She has no idea that someone with evil intentions has other plans for her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dezi has just landed the job of his career. Ruggedly handsome and entirely focused on himself, he has made his photography work priority number one. As he heads to L.A. for the shoot, he has absolutely no interest in a new relationship, until one literally falls into his lap. His clumsy introduction to Ella leads to the deepest, most intense encounter either of them has ever had.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ahmed is the son of an Iraqi woman and a British man, doctors who cherished their brilliant boy until they died in the bombing of a Baghdad hospital. As he watches a rising star in American politics tell her nation the dead citizens are an acceptable loss in the pursuit of a greater good, Ahmed focuses singularly on her as the perpetrator of his personal tragedy. Guided by an obsessive need for vengeance, Ahmed builds the skills he will need to punish her for taking away all that he loved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unwittingly, Ella becomes his pawn as he infiltrates her life to lure her mother out. Will a woman who has sacrificed and clawed her way to the White House follow protocol, or her heart, when she learns her daughter is in mortal danger?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Can Ella and Dezi&amp;#39;s fragile new passion survive both a maniac&amp;#39;s wicked vendetta, and a potentially deadly disease that could take one of them out for good?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Last Flight Out&amp;quot; is the story of being true to who you are, facing your own regrets, and maybe having the opportunity to set things right before it&amp;#39;s too late.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A portion of the proceeds will be donated to organizations dedicated to fighting breast cancer across New Hampshire." />
