  <title>&lt;B&gt;Subtle Sins&lt;/B&gt; - Laurie Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first victim never saw it coming. As the rope tightened around his neck, he clawed desperately at the killer&#39;s hands. Before surrendering to death, he realized who the killer was and simply asked, &quot;Why?&quot;&lt;p&gt;
	Police Chief Madelyn Barclay jumps into the investigation like a hound on the trail but before long there&#39;s another killing. Then another. Solid evidence eludes her as subtle connections lead her astray. Dead-end clues play havoc with her mind.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burrowing deeper into the investigation, she realizes there&#39;s more going on than just murder. It&#39;s a mind game of power.
	&lt;p&gt;As the department&#39;s first female police chief, Madelyn has much to prove and she worries that her reputation will suffer. Time runs short and the pressure is on. Desperate for help, she enlists the services of her old gumshoe friend, Craige McCall, who is immediately thrust into a psychological game of hide-and-seek with the killer.
	&lt;p&gt;Finally, a suspect emerges but he&#39;s always one step ahead and he&#39;s loaded with alibis. Could they be on the wrong track again?
This killer has proven to be a terrifying adversary whose next victim might very well be one of the department&#39;s own. 
	&lt;p&gt;Chilling suspense to the very end." />
