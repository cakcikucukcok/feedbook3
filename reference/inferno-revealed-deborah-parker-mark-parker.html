  <title>Inferno Revealed - Deborah Parker, Mark Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Using Dan Brown&#39;s book as a jumping off point, &lt;i&gt;Inferno Revealed &lt;/i&gt;will provide readers of Brown&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Inferno &lt;/i&gt;with an engaging introduction to Dante and his world. Much like the books on Leonardo that followed the release of the &lt;i&gt;Da Vinci Code&lt;/i&gt;, this book will provide readers with more information about the ever-intriguing Dante. Specifically, &lt;i&gt;Inferno Revealed&lt;/i&gt; explores how Dante made himself the protagonist of &lt;i&gt;The Divine Comedy,&lt;/i&gt; something no other epic poet has done, a move for which the ramifications have not yet been fully explored. The mysteries and puzzles that arise from Dante&#39;s choice to personalize the epic, along with his affinity for his local surroundings and how that affects his depiction of the places, Church, and politics in the poem are considered--along with what this reveals about Brown&#39;s own usage of the work.&lt;br&gt;The authors will focus on and analyze how Dan Brown has repurposed &lt;i&gt;Inferno&lt;/i&gt; in his newest book--noting what he gets right and what errors are made when he does not. Of course, Dan Brown is not the first author to base his work on Dante. &lt;i&gt;The Comedy&lt;/i&gt; has elicited many adaptations from major canonical writers such as Milton and Keats to popular adaptations like David Fincher&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Se7en &lt;/i&gt;and Tim Burton&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Beetlejuice--&lt;/i&gt; all of which will be discussed in detail within&lt;i&gt; Inferno Revealed&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
