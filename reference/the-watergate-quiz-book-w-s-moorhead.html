  <title>The Watergate Quiz Book - W. S. Moorhead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;During the two-year political circus that was Watergate, were you&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) &lt;i&gt;A junkie&lt;/i&gt;, who followed the developments day by day, relishing every sordid detail?&lt;br&gt;(2) &lt;i&gt;A dabbler&lt;/i&gt;, who caught up every now and then with the latest revelation?&lt;br&gt;(3) &lt;i&gt;An avoider&lt;/i&gt;, who ignored it all as much as possible, assuming that everyone involved was probably guilty of something?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;re in the first group, &lt;i&gt;you&#39;re going to love this book&lt;/i&gt;, because it&#39;s a fact-loaded, comprehensive, and challenging test of your memory. If you&#39;re in the second group, &lt;i&gt;you should read this book&lt;/i&gt;, to fill in all of the 18½-minute gaps in your knowledge. If you&#39;re in the third group, &lt;i&gt;you need this book&lt;/i&gt;, because Watergate is too important to remain ignorant about permanently, and this is the only complete history that is enjoyable and that truly captures the spirit of it all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are in danger of forgetting the greatest American political scandal of this century--and also one of the century&#39;s greatest entertainments, starring the man who actually said after it was all over, &quot;I wasn&#39;t lying. I said things which later on seemed to be untrue.&quot; Decades have passed now, and it&#39;s a fine time to look back. &lt;i&gt;The Watergate Quiz Book &lt;/i&gt;organizes two years of confusing allegations, revelations, and testimony into ten chronological chapters of nasty, challenging questions: true/false, multiple choice, direct response, and--for Watergate fanatics only--difficult &quot;Deep Throat&quot; questions. Remember the &quot;Rose Mary Stretch&quot;? Did you know which presidential aides were &lt;i&gt;not &lt;/i&gt;recruited from the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency&#39;s Los Angeles office? Did you ever learn what &quot;Gemstone&quot; was? Operation Sandwedge? Who was the Tickler? Who knew about what, and when? And--biggest question of all--who was Mark Felt, better known as Deep Throat? Test your Watergate I.Q., or learn it all for the first time!&lt;/p&gt;" />
