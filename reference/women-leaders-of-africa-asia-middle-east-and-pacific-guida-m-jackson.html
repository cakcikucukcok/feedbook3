  <title>Women Leaders of Africa, Asia, Middle East, and Pacific - Guida M. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Women Leaders of Africa, Asia, Middle East, and Pacific presents biographical sketches of hundreds of women leaders from earliest recorded history down to the present time. It is the first of two volumes giving data on women leaders from every continent and island in the world; the second volume deals with Europe and countries of the Western Hemisphere.
	Each book is divided into two sections. Part I of this volume deals with African women leaders; Part II with Asian, Middle East and Pacific women. Within each section, which is introduced by an essay overview, entries are arranged alphabetically. Suggestions for further reading on the subject appear at the end of each entry.
	Not all entries are merely recitations of facts. Some womens lives do not lend themselves to being reduced to statistics. Many were much too colorful, or lusty, or bloodthirsty to fit into a neat categorical description. How do you easily characterize the rule of the African queen who hacked her servant to death after she was through using him as a chairjust to intimidate her new Portuguese overlord? Who kept as many as thirty slaves as sexual partners, supposedly killing them off when she had finished with them? How do you gloss over the actions of the newly enthroned Persian queen who ordered her stepbrother strangled, then had gold and silver coins struck bearing her new title: Purity of the earthly world and of the faith? How do you describe nicely the actions of the Chinese queen who chopped off her own hand to make a point to a man she had just condemned to death? How do you ascribe feminine traits to a grandmother who tried to kill her own grandson to keep him from succeeding her on the throne she herself had stolen?
	On the other hand, how do you do justice to the Queen of Tonga without mention of her commanding sizesix feet two inchesor her forty-seven-year devotion to matters far beyond mere governance but of more importance to her subjects: like establishing handicraft outlets to market the wares of her people? Or to the Queen of Thailand who acted as Regent while the King, a devout Buddhist, performed his meditations and duties as a monk? She directed much more than affairs of state; her concern for the common people led her to promote the export of hand-woven Thai silk and to establish a chain of shops selling native crafts. She also organized the Thai Red Cross for aid to refugees, orphans, wounded soldiers, and flood victims.   
	These and dozens of stories like them make African, Asian, Middle East, and Pacific Women Leaders a unique treasure that is hard to put down.    
	Although most of the entries in this volume deal with women rulers, a portion of the book is devoted to women in leadership roles other than those of queen, empress, prime minister, or chieftainess. Of these additional entries, the majority deals with contemporary women judges, secretaries of state, cabinet members, or legislators of unusual influence and power." />
