It&#39;s romantic and exciting to think of Google Patents leadership as all inspiration, decisive action, and rich rewards, but leading requires taking risks that can jeopardize your career and your personal life. It requires putting yourself on the line, disturbing the status quo, and surfacing hidden conflict. And when people resist and push back, there&#39;s a strong temptation to play it safe.
