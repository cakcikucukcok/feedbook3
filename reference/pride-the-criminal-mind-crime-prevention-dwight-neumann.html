  <title>Pride, the Criminal Mind, &amp; Crime Prevention - Dwight Neumann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The first half of Pride, the Criminal Mind, and Crime Prevention provides the reader with summaries of common crimes processed in the criminal courts of California.  The crimes range from graffiti tagging to first degree murder.  The second part of this work turns to youngsters, as well as to students of criminology and the criminal justice system, to offer a format for behaving ethically and avoiding criminality.  As a didactic tool, it opens the doors to instructors for teaching through role playing sessions of personal life experiences which expose false pride and other human frailties.
The present study may be best suited as a textbook companion and reader for college majors of sociology, psychology, and the criminal justice system.  It offers an analysis after each summary of the criminal cases presented which addresses the perpetrators mentality, motivation, and rationalization for committing crimes.  As the title suggests, pride is considered crucial in the criminal mind and can often be found as a catalyst, justification, and even a right to criminal behavior." />
