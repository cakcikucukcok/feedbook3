  <title>Papa’S Letters - Judith C. Lovell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What a powerful story! Thank you for not thinking it robbery to share. Isnt love an amazing thing? Papa wrote very well. He was brilliant in his observations. I never knew any of my grandparents and I envy ever so slightly, 
those persons blessed to have that richness as part of their family quilt. God bless. 
Continue to share your grandparents with the rest of us. 
---Annette Smith, Author of Etched
 I was blown away! Your detailed descriptions of your loved ones, accompanied by those magnificent letters from 1914, left me speechless. There is nothing more inspirational and soul stirring than reading a story about true love based in reality. Thanks for sharing.
---Rebecca McFadden, Author of Surfing to Find the One
Youve given us such a lovely gift. I was touched on so many levels by: 
The determination and devotion of your grandfather and the abiding love between your grandparents that is revealed in excerpts from his letters 
The glimpses of the challenges faced by a West Indian immigrant determined to make it in America 
The parallels between your son and his great-grandfather 
The reminder you have given us to maintain the precious human connection through letter writing in this age of technology 
Barbara Gardner, Instructor, Boricua College
Your grandfather is awesome! His writings are poetry from the heart. Several times, I just stopped reading and said, Oh my God, this man is bad! My head is full, my heart is overflowing, my pen is ready, paper is convenient and ink is nearby: All I have to do is write. Shootpure, passionate, prayerful poetry!
