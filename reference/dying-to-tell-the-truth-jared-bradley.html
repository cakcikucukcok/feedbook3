  <title>Dying to Tell the Truth - Jared Bradley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a story about my life as a Christian and my struggle in loving my neighbor as myself. It is based on a true story about friends, family, and the people who made a difference in my life. It explains how hard it was for me growing up as a Christian and how challenging it was for a young person like me to share my faith with unbelievers. Even as a Christian, I didnt understand how to fight temptation or depend on Gods grace to survive. 
Rather, I was very distant from God and became very depressed because I was not willing to surrender everything in order to follow him. Through prayer, I learned that my friends were the ones God used to pull me out of my depression. My closest friend was always there for me even when life was hard for both of us. The important lesson to be learned behind this story is to forgive your neighbor and God will forgive you." />
