  <title>The Medicine Cabinet of Curiosities - Nicholas Bakalar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Delightful doses of medical miscellany about wacky doctors and their curious patients, from their smallest bones (the stapes) to their heaviest organs (the liver)&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this addictive collection of trivia, Nicholas Bakalar, the &quot;Vital Signs&quot; columnist for &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt;, spoons out the things you never realized you really want to know about your body and your health. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bakalar shares the wonders of medicine, from medical firsts (in 1667, the first survivor of a blood transfusion received sheep&#39;s blood) to medical onlys (rabies is the only infectious disease that is 100 percent curable when treated and 100 percent fatal if not). He takes a tour of diseases that belong in horror movies: liquefying organs, flesh-eating bacteria, mushrooms sprouting in the throat. He notes remarkable remedies, such as dark chocolate, which can stand in for blood-pressure pills. And he dissects the chemistry of the human body (including the 0.0000000000000015259 percent that is radium). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a specialist&#39;s attention to the funny bone as well as the gray matter, Bakalar&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Medicine Cabinet of Curiosities&lt;/i&gt; tickles the curiosity of both the healthy and the hypochondriac, following Voltaire&#39;s dictum that &quot;the art of medicine consists of amusing the patient while nature cures the disease.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
