  <title>The Bike Hike - Daniel Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is the story of a guy&#39;s dream to travel the Pacific coast on his bicycle. To leave everyone he loves and everything he owns to depart on trip with no return. After thinking about it for 10 years, he finally decides to do it. This trip will take him from Montreal, Canada throughout the United States and along the Pacific Coast to end in Vancouver, Canada.  During his journey he learns to live with what he has. He learns about the outdoor experience and to live with nature. He gets challenges and different situations to overcome and also the physical and mental strain he endured. He visits cities, and meets people he will never forget. He must change his itinerary, sometimes because he wants to, other times because he has no choice. This writing brings this adventure to a climax which is unexpected. The Bike Hike brings twists and turns that he, himself cannot foresee. For three weeks, he describes the freedom he senses within, and the fears that can be around, at any corner.
Mr. Trump,
You have been talking about fi xing immigration and broken borders by deporting millions of illegal aliens. Putting up a wall is not the immediate solution to get rid of illegal aliens or undocumented residents. I was an illegal alien for ten years in the United States and lived the American dream at its fullest. I was able to obtain all the necessary documents to have a great life In the U.S.A. including; Social security card, ID card, Bank card, credit cards(7), Drivers license. I paid income tax also. Yes, illegal aliens can pay taxes; Police offi cers arrest illegals with no papers all the time. Because of internal bureaucracy and ill-will they are released hours later. The biggest problem is the social security card.
That is just a few examples of internal bureaucracy loop-holes. If the government would address these loop-holes, you could solve a lot of immigration problems.
Mr. Trump; before putting up walls and deporting women, children and good hard working people, read this book. It will help you restore immigration issues in the United States with dignity. These people are not the enemy... They just want to live the American dream." />
