  <title>Nurturing the Human Spirit Through Character Development in Adolescents - Rev. Dr. Bronco H. Crooke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nurturing the Human Spirit through Character Development in Adolescents
was designed to discover and develop the spiritual nature of our adolescents
by assisting them in discerning and constructing positive character-building
skills. By familiarizing them to their own and other religious beliefs and practices,
the adolescents will be able to more easily accommodate themselves to their diverse
neighborhoods and schools. By understanding their peers religious and social practices,
a common underlying tension is removed from their daily lives, enabling them to better
learn in an educational setting.
It is also designed to increase their cognitive developmental assets. Recent studies have
shown that the adolescent should possess forty-one (41) developmental assets. From the
research I have conducted, our youth have eighteen (18) or less developmental assets.
Th is program will be benefi cial to parents and adolescents in helping them recognize
and embrace their ethical and spiritual identity in the diverse society in which they live.
When we look at the world around us and see all the chaos and then ask ourselves why?
Why so much disorder in our world where peace and love should reign. Have we ever
stopped and considered the spirit? Th at part of every human being which gives us the
ability to do all that we do, every second of our lives. For me, I believe that when the spirit
is broken or separated from its creator, it is left without the loving and compassionate
components that prevent it from developing in the way in which it should grow. Left
without proper guidance, then the sprit (life force) does what pleases it. Th e Apostle
Paul tells us in Romans 7:14-16 For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am of fl esh,
sold into bondage to sin. For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing
what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate. But if I do the very thing I do
not want to do, I agree with the Law, confessing that the Law is good. As human beings
we have to stop with, I want what I want and really dont care about what is right and
humane. Th e human race must start thinking in terms of who we really are, spirit
being clothed in fl esh, bone &amp; blood spirit. We have the power to change the negatives
to positives and the positives to accomplishing goals and aspirations. But we should
stop excluding our Creator from our lives and invite God to be in control of our
spirit; that part of our life that gives us life, the spirit. Re-connecting the spirit.
Re-educating the spirit. Re-directing the spirit. Nurture your spirit." />
