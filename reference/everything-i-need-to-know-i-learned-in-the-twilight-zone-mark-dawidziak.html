  <title>Everything I Need to Know I Learned in the Twilight Zone - Mark Dawidziak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Can you live your life by what &lt;i&gt;The Twilight Zone &lt;/i&gt;has to teach you? Yes, and maybe you should. The proof is in this lighthearted collection of life lessons, ground rules, inspirational thoughts, and stirring reminders found in Rod Serling&#39;s timeless fantasy series. Written by veteran TV critic, Mark Dawidziak, this unauthorized tribute is a celebration of the classic anthology show, but also, on another level, a kind of fifth-dimension self-help book, with each lesson supported by the morality tales told by Serling and his writers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The notion that &quot;it&#39;s never too late to reinvent yourself&quot; soars through &quot;The Last Flight,&#39;&#39; in which a World War I flier who goes forward in time and gets the chance to trade cowardice for heroism. A visit from an angel blares out the wisdom of &quot;follow your passion&quot; in &quot;A Passage for Trumpet.&quot; The meaning of &quot;divided we fall&quot; is driven home with dramatic results when neighbors suspect neighbors of being invading aliens in &quot;The Monsters Are Due on Maple Street.&quot; The old maxim about never judging a book by its cover is given a tasty twist when an alien tome is translated in &quot;To Serve Man.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
