  <title>Evangelism in a Post Christian Culture - Dr Alastair Ferrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Evangelism in a Post-Christian Culture&lt;/i&gt; is the challenge facing the church today. &lt;b&gt;Alastair Ferrie&lt;/b&gt; brings more than thirty years experience of preaching the gospel and sharing his faith. One of the greatest needs of the growing church is a training program for the whole church in evangelism.  Those engaged in ministry will find this work invaluable, and those committed Christians in the pews will find this book a framework which will revolutionize their effectiveness in evangelism.&lt;br&gt;
Many Christians will admit to not knowing where to begin. This book explains and outlines an approach that can be used effectively in sharing the gospel. The material will also be useful for preaching and for use in Bible discussion groups.
A companion volume to this work, &lt;i&gt;Step-by-Step: Aftercare for New Christians&lt;/i&gt; is also published by iUniverse.&lt;br&gt;

The book begins with a discussion on worldview which explains the difficulty we often have in communicating the gospel with a world that has truly become post-Christian.  A five fold foundational Christian worldview is put forward and contrasted with a Darwinian model so prevalent in the world today.
This is followed by several chapters outlining an approach to evangelism based on the seven signs of John&#39;s gospel.  &quot;These things are written that you might believe.&quot;    
The book is rounded off with several chapters with the theme, &quot;I believe because...&quot;   These are arguments that the author has presented in many home Bible studies to help people to see some reasons for believing.  The world is constantly presented with reasons for NOT believing, and it is time for the church to step forward with some reasons for believing." />
