  <title>The Seventh Day - Kris Doulos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to the Lord, one day is the same as one thousand years and one thousand years is the same as one day (2 Pet. 3:8).
Based upon dates recorded in the Bible and the words of Christ, this world has just begun its seventh millennial day.
Why did God create man and this universe?
What commonly known creative force is left out of the theory of evolution?
What speed is greater than the speed of light?
What language is used to communicate with animals and inanimate objects?
What makes people in all religions acceptable to God?
Who are the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit if there is only one God? 
What does 600, 60, 6 represent?
When did the apocalypse happen?
When was the battle of Armageddon?
For people waiting for Christ to return, where is he now? What is he doing?
What causes more death and destruction than all other forces combined?
An unbiased person who trusts the information in the Bible and secular history will readily see the answers to these questions.
You may be surprised at the simplicity of these answers." />
