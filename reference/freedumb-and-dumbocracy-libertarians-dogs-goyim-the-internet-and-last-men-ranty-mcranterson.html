  <title>Freedumb and Dumbocracy: Libertarians, Dogs, Goyim, the Internet, and Last Men - Ranty McRanterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;I may not agree with you, but I will defend to the death your right to make an ass of yourself.&quot; - Oscar Wilde Thanks to the likes of Wilde, the world is now overrun by asses. The Pope of Fools has been unleashed to preside over the Dumbocalypse. No one needs to burn any books these days since no one reads any books. That would require intelligence and effort. Who needs such things in this time of the internet, the domain of cyber idiocy, of the global moronocracy? Every day on social media is a feast of fools, a bonfire of the inanities. We&#39;re never far from the sadding crowd. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first give a Facebook account. The Pope of Dopes is elected at the Dinner of Dunces. The internet ought to appoint its Troll King of the Day, its Cyber Idiot, its Clown Prince, its World Wide Pleb. Plato thought it insane to entrust power to the mob. He compared them to a bunch of drunks on a party ship, a pleasure cruiser for dummies, sailing to its inevitable doom." />
