  <title>A New Economic System: Guide to Debt Elimination and Wealth Creation - Yusef Rashid DeLaine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The masses of human-beings on earth are struggling and suffering with poverty because the financial system of Capitalism is a pyramidal structure based upon &quot;divide and conquer&quot; that permits the top 5% to become wealthy at the expense of 95% of the masses of people thereby creating a working poor middle class and a permanent underclass through trickledown economics and debt accumulation. Conversely, Karl Marx&#39;s financial system of Socialism (Communism) redistributes wealth equally among the members of Society and eradicates poverty, but puts a ceiling on the amount of Wealth and Prosperity of its citizens; and does not eliminate debt for all of humanity. Furthermore, the financial system of Capitalistic-Socialism permits certain members of Society to become Wealthy, yet some of this wealth is also distributed among the less fortunate through the taxation of the wealthy, but this still does not create total wealth and prosperity and elimination of debt for all of humanity." />
