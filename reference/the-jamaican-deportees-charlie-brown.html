  <title>The Jamaican Deportees - Charlie Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the effect of U.S. Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA of 1996) and criminal deportation to Jamaica; the issues associated with &#39;deportees&#39; or deported migrants resettlement and re-integration, and increased crime and violence in Jamaica which several &#39;high-ranking&#39; police officers and policy-makers claimed deportees are responsible for. It also represents a dedicated attempt to bridge both lines of inquiry between increased criminal deportation and increased crime and violence in Jamaica over a period of time, wherein criminal deportees are constantly being blamed for the high murder rate and alarming crime figures in the country, placing deported migrants at a severe disadvantage.    
Based on six years of studies and notes-taking, I find that there are two types of deported migrants and over six different categories of us and I write in details about the categories. Some people are unreformed or dangerous and are involved in criminal activities based on a variety of factors, while the majority are law abiding citizens. Quite a few, including myself have tertiary degrees, meaningful skills, and &#39;first world&#39; experiences that are in demand thus we can contribute to the society in positive ways, but we are highly marginalized. And the Government especially, and some uninformed people in the society discriminate against deported migrants (deportees) for arcane reasons.
I write about the issues and challenges that some deported migrants have to deal with, the problems that some &#39;unreformed&#39; or desperate ones have caused, the reasons why re-integration and meaningful support is necessary, how I was abducted or unlawfully arrested by the police and  wrongfully prosecuted and unlawfully convicted by a state prosecutor, and how I was sentenced to an illegal term of imprisonment by a presiding judge and then wrongfully or inadvertently deported to Jamaica by the ICE even though I am a veteran of the US Army with a service-connected injury. The IIRIRA of 1996 is a reform of laws that are in need of careful revision in the interest of the &#39;American Justice&#39; and fairness to non-US citizens who are permanent residents of the United States.
