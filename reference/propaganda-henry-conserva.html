      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;This book was written in response to the wishes of several readers of my book, &lt;I&gt;Propaganda Techniques&lt;/I&gt;, who wanted to have me probe somewhat deeper into the subject of propaganda. After some discussions with teachers and students, I used some of their ideas to come up with ten questions. This gave me the title of this book , &lt;I&gt;Propaganda : A Question and Answer Approach&lt;/I&gt;, Having developed a list of question I went about the task of trying to answer them as best as I could.
