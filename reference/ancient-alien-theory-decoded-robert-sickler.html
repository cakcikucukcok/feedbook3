  <title>Ancient Alien Theory Decoded - Robert Sickler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For those who undertake a serious investigation of unidentified flying objects (UFO), there can be no questioning their reality. Still, our government would have people believe UFOs are natural earthly phenomenon. Ancient alien theorist, however, claim unidentified flying objects are highly advanced alien mechanical devices. Furthermore, the theorist would have us believe aliens are associated with the genesis of mankind, and during our formative years, they guided us with both technology and the teaching of civil/moral standards. On the one hand, we have our government saying it is nothing, and on the other hand, we have ancient alien theorists saying ancient aliens were the gods we used to worship. We cannot help but wonder why the government denies alien existence and, at the same time, ancient alien theorists preach a coming alien salvation. It is only when the ancient alien theory is decoded that elements of truth are revealed." />
