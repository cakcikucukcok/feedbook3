  <title>The Treatment of Iraqi Turks Since the Aftermath of Wwi - Yawooz Ezzat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The legacy of colonial power in many undeveloped countries (in the aftermath of the First World War) is closely linked with the many problems that those countries are now experiencing. These problems are used as a smokescreen whenever the dominant countries of the world wish to further their interests; these poorer nations can be manipulated through religion or nationalism, or any other factor of expediency. What has happened throughout history (i.e., before, during, and after WW1) was not through happenstance. But rather logic dictates that a sophisticated political plan has been in place, and the long-lasting cold war between the Eastern and Western Blocks, driven by their contradicting beliefs over a universal political system, has had the sole aim of gaining control over the vast oil and gas reserves of the region. 
Such machinations were evident in Central Namibia, where genocidal crimes were committed against the Herero population by the German dictator; his solders and other ethnic groups were manipulated for the above purpose. This also happened in Algeria where the colonial power was France; the French supported a military junta who committed genocidal crimes over decades in the name of maintaining stability and control over Mediterranean Sea. The Turkic descendents in Iraq have been subjected to similar methods (i.e., ethnic cleansing since the aftermath of the WWI) and for the same purpose. 
The main objective of this research therefore has been to develop an in-depth analysis of the treatment of Iraqi Turks following WWI, arguing that the above systematic ethnic cleansing in Iraq has links with the colonial era. If Iraqis continue to ignore this fact and continue to blame each other, ethnic cleansing will continue, and it may affect other groups as well. Yet the new world order and financial system is designed in such a way as to serve those aims, and international law is too feeble to counter those plans. The ethnic cleansing in Iraq will remain unchanged as long as the political elite in Iraq continue to serve the aims of the great powers." />
