  <title>How to Turn Poems, Lyrics, &amp; Folklore into &lt;I&gt;Salable&lt;/I&gt; Children&#39;s Books - Anne Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you want to adapt your poem to a storybook that tells a story in words, and pictures-or only amplify the images that you create with words? Would you rather turn your poem into a picture book that tells a story with pictures?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will words take second place to illustrations? Decide first whether you will write a story book or a picture book. Then use the images in your poem to clarify your writing. You won&#39;t be able to read a picture book into a tape recorder or turn it into an audio book or radio play. You will be able to narrate a word book for audio playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with an inspirational poem, proverb, or song lyrics. Ask children what makes them laugh. You can make something out of nothing. You can make a story out of anything intangible, such as an idea with a plan still in your mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capture your children&#39;s dreams, proverbs, song lyrics, and the surprise elements that make them laugh. Record imagination, &quot;what-if&quot; talk, and personal history. A folktale or story is something that could come from any place in the past, from science, or from nothing that you can put your hands on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What children want in a book, poem, or folklore is a cave where they can go to be themselves. When suspending belief, children still want to be themselves as they navigate fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story book becomes a den or tree house where children can go inside, shut the door, and play. Introduce children to poetry by showing how you transform your poem into a children&#39;s book by expanding and emphasizing significant events in the life story of one child.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poems, memorable experiences, significant life events or turning points are all ways to make something out of nothing tangible. You begin re-working a concept, framework, or vision. Here&#39;s how to write, publish, and promote salable material from concept to framework to poem to children&#39;s book-step-by-step.&lt;/p&gt;" />
