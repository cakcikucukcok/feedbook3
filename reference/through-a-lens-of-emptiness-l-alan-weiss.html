  <title>Through a Lens of Emptiness - L. Alan Weiss</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no question that entering the third act of life often prompts individuals to reflect on their journey to date, their purpose in life, and their search for self. &lt;i&gt;Through A Lens of Emptiness&lt;/i&gt; recounts how one man seeking clarity and perspective in the story of a lifetime learns to discard preconceptions, embrace emptiness, abandon ego, and ultimately discover a path of enlightenment.&lt;p&gt;
L. Alan Weiss details how he began his quest to create his life narrative by utilizing Buddhist and Taoist philosophies and powerful tools that helped him define the nature of self through meditation, productive emptiness, and reflective thought processes. Weiss then turns the lens on his own life and thoughts as he sought clarity and understanding, searched for his back story, and explored his religious roots. Included are Weisss reflections on his personal discoveries, the nature of change, and what he gained through the process of revisiting his life story.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Through a Lens of Emptiness&lt;/i&gt; shares a journal of contemplation as one man embarks on a critical search for the essence of a meaningful life." />
