  <title>Secrets of the Terra-Cotta Soldier - Ying Chang Compestine, Vinson Compestine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Â &lt;/div&gt;
In this action-packed adventure and coming-of-age story that finely weaves fact and fiction, thirteen-year-old Ming lives in a small village in Maoist China in the 1970s. His father is convinced that Emperor Qin&#39;s tomb--and the life-size terra-cottaÂ army created to serve and protect the emperor in the afterlife--lies hidden in the hills around them. But if Ming&#39;s father doesn&#39;t prove it soon, the town&#39;s Political Officer willÂ condemn him to the brutal labor camps. From the stories of a terra-cotta soldier who has survived through the centuries, Ming learns the history of Emperor Qin, known for building the Great Wall of China, and how and why the terra-cotta soldiers came to be. As their unlikely friendship develops, Ming experiences the mysterious tomb firsthand, braving deadly traps and witnessing the terra-cotta army in action. Most importantly, he comes to see how he can save both the terra-cotta soldiers and his father from the corrupt Political Officer and his Communist cronies.&lt;br&gt;
The book is illustrated with photographs of Communist Chinese village life in the 1970s, the Great Wall, and, of course, the excavated tomb with its many terra-cotta soldiers.Â It also features a special recipe from the story.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;Secrets of the Terra-Cotta Soldier&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Historical photos and Indiana Jones+&quot;style adventure enrich this tale of an unusual meeting between the Qin Dynasty and the 20th century.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Despite the hardships, both courageous characters work to uphold their respective duties: Shi to protect the tomb and Ming to protect the cultural legacy of China&#39;s people. With archival art, recipes, and end notes, this title is sure to be a hit in the classroom.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
