Now father and son are both missing. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when a rogue Mogadorian named Adam, who now has Number One&#39;s memories, decides the only way to make up for his past atrocities is to return home and infiltrate the Mogadorian stronghold, he&#39;ll find the key to saving both Sam and Malcolm&#39;s life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
