  <title>The First Easter - Ana Anastasia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Holidays are filled with symbols that become important parts of their celebrations. For example, when you think of Christmas, presents, a Christmas tree, or a holly wreath might come to mind. Turkeys are a symbol of Thanksgiving. And when it comes to Easter, the egg has long been part of its celebration.
Author Ana Anastasias The First Easter provides a possible explanation for how coloured and decorated eggs became associated with Easter. She shares how some animals got together and, after discussion and planning, created the first Easter egg. Youll learn how each animal had a role to play, each as important as the next. And youll discover why a rabbit is responsible for delivering Easter eggs.
The First Easter tickles the imagination to come up with other possible theories about Easter eggs and other symbols. Once you learn that all that noise you hear when animals are together might be much more than that, youll look at animals in a different way. Who knows what theyre planning!" />
