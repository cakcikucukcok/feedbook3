  <title>Sam and Socrates - John Russell, Katie Byrne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam is an intelligent and inquisitive eight year old who loves her cat, books and afternoon outings with her father. One day, during one of their walks, Sam and her father sit by a tree and read together. Feeling a little tired, she puts her head on his shoulder and drifts off to sleep. Now dreaming, she is once again at the tree, this time with her father and her cat, Socrates. Lazily relaxing on Sams lap, Socrates is suddenly awakened to the presence of a mouse and immediately leaps off in pursuit of his prey. Calling to him, Sam jumps to her feet and runs to a nearby wall that he has jumped over. As she is about to climb over, an Owl suddenly appears before her. May I help you? he asks politely. At first, a little surprised to hear an Owl talk, she explains that she is going to retrieve her cat who has jumped over the wall while chasing a mouse. What follows next is an adventure into a world filled with animals that talk, learning, inspiration and all manner of wonderous things that only a childs imagination could
make memorable. So, sit back in your favourite reading chair and prepare to be taken on a journey filled with friendship and love......it will be a journey you will not soon forget." />
