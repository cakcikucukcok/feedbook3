  <title>The Dragon Princess - Audrey Humphreys</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time so begins The Dragon Princess, a full-colour and beautifully woven magical tale that childrens book author Audrey Humphreys brings to vivid life. Unlike most fairy tales however, this story does away with the traditional plot and instead renders a new and modern twist that everyone  even parents  will find delightfully insightful and hilariously entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dragon Princess begins when a handsome and honourable prince, who lives in the southern part of the kingdom, hears word that the princess in the far northern part of the kingdom is in need of rescuing from a fierce, mean and ugly-looking dragon. On his mighty steed, he travels for days, until he reaches the smoke-filled castle of the princess. Just when he is about to slay the dragon, he finds out to his surprise, that the princess needs to be rescued not from the dragon but from something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With dreamlike illustrations by Barbara Sercombe, The Dragon Princess is a valuable, charming and funny picture book that brings parents and children together for a wonderful and easy reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;
