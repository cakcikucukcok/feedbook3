  <title>The Truth About Jack - Jody Gehrman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;The Truth About Jack&lt;/i&gt; certainly ticked all the boxes for me. It was funny and sweet and romantic and left me with the warm glowies after I&#39;d finished it.&quot;&lt;b&gt; -Claire, Book Blog Bird&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dakota McCloud has just been accepted into a prestigious art school. Soon she&#39;ll leave behind the artists&#39; colony where she grew up--hippie dad, tofu since birth, yurt--and join her boyfriend and best friend on the East Coast. It was &lt;i&gt;the plan&lt;/i&gt;...until Dakota finds out her boyfriend and best friend hooked up behind her back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hurt and viciously betrayed, Dakota pours out her heart on a piece of paper, places it in a bottle, and hurls it into the ocean. But it doesn&#39;t quite go where she expects...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jack Sauvage finds the bottle washed up on the shore and responds to Dakota&#39;s letter. Except what if his straight-laced life doesn&#39;t jive with the free-spirited girl he&#39;s only seen from afar? As Jack creates a persona he believes she&#39;ll love, they slowly fall for each other with each new letter. Now Jack is trying to find a way to make this delicate, on-paper romance happen in real life...without revealing his deception.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains references to missed connections, mistaken identities, and lots of misbehavior. It may give you all the swoony feels.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
