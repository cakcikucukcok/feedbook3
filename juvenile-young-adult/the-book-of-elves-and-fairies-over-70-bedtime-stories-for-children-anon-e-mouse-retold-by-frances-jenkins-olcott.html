  <title>THE BOOK OF ELVES AND FAIRIES - Over 70 bedtime stories for children - Anon E. Mouse, Retold by Frances Jenkins Olcott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An ancient Hopi proverb states &amp;ldquo;&lt;i&gt;He who tells stories, rules the world.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;rdquo; Well here is your chance to become a King, or a Queen for a day, or at least, a few hours&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
Herein, are more than 70 stories and poems gathered from Scotland, Ireland, Sweden, Wales, China, England, Japan, New Zealand and other faraway places &amp;mdash; are retold here by Olcott for children aged 10 and up.&lt;br /&gt;
Stories like Cinderella, Toads and Diamonds, Robin Goodfellow, Butterfly&amp;rsquo;s Diamond, Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, Timothy Tuttle and the Little Imps, The Coal-Black Steed, Elsa And The Ten Elves, The Fairy Island, The Four-Leafed Clover, The Enchanted Watch and Queen Mab abound.&lt;br /&gt;
When a child open the covers of this book, straightway they enter that land of all delights&amp;mdash;the Fairy Realm. Here Fairy Godmothers reward good children, red-capped Little Men yield up their treasures of gold and magic gifts, while Pixies drop silver pennies in water-pails, and merry Spriggans and Fays hold nightly revels in the moonlight. Here, too, a child may dance in Fairy Rings, or fly away to Elfinland for a year and a day to play with wonder-children, pick Fairy flowers, listen to Fairy birds, and be fed on magic goodies.&lt;br /&gt;
And every story is about &amp;ldquo;Fairies black, grey, green, and white,&amp;rdquo; and every one has been selected for delightful humour, fancy, or ethical teaching.&lt;br /&gt;
