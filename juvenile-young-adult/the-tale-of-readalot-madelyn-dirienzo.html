  <title>The Tale of Readalot - Madelyn DiRienzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the quiet little town of Readalot, there are two hills. There are only two families in Readalot. On one hill lives the Vowels family, while the other hill is where the Consonants family lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Vowels have five children. Their names are A, E, I, O, and U. They have so much fun playing, picking wild flowers, and pretending together, but something is still missing. The Vowels children often wonder what it would be like if they had friends to play with. They arent allowed to go past the valley between the hills, so they have never seen the Consonants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day, however, a mysterious newcomer comes to visit the Vowels home in search of his cousins, the Consonants and the Vowels. Is this the Vowels chance to get to know who lives with Mr. and Mrs. Consonant? &lt;/p&gt;" />
