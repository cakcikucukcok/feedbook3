  <title>Dougal&#39;s Diary - David Greagg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After some traumatic early life experiences, Dougal the black-and-white kitten falls on his paws into a loving home with two kind humans.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dougal decides to repay his humans&#39; kindness by trying to be a Good Cat at all times.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But when you have a little sister like Shadow, being good isn&#39;t as easy as it should be; because Shadow is an alley-cat who eats his food and loves rummaging in bins and stealing from neighbours&#39; barbecues.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;And, although they don&#39;t know it, the kind humans are not in charge in this house. That role goes to the imperious old cat Belladonna, who does not take kindly to newcomers in her space.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dougal and Shadow&#39;s new home also has a large resident family of wattle-birds, and a supporting cast of neighbouring cats with agendas of their own; so the kittens must learn their place in the pecking order.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Dougal&#39;s diplomatic skills will be tested to their limit as he tries to make sense of human and feline psychology.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You can also catch up with Dougal, join his fanclub and get some pressies at his very own website &lt;a
