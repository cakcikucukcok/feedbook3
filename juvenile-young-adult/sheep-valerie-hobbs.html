  <title>Sheep - Valerie Hobbs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The sheep closed in around him like a big, woolly blanket. The puppy had never been so scared or so excited in his life. Soon he was racing, feinting, dodging - learning what it means to be one of the proud breed of Border collies, the finest sheepherders in the world. Then, almost overnight, his life is turned upside down. He finds himself in a series of strange places, with no sheep, his family gone. With nothing but the courage he was born with and a dream, he searches for the life he once knew, gathering names and adventures as he goes. For a short time, he&#39;s called Blackie. To the Goat Man, he&#39;s Shep. To Hollerin, he&#39;s Spot. There&#39;s one name that threatens to forever haunt him - Sparky, the name Billy the circus man calls him when he reaches for the whip. But there&#39;s another name that he is given, one that finally makes him feel at home . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Known for her rich character development, the author brings all her skills to delving into the mind of a clever, philosophical, and hopeful dog searching for a home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
