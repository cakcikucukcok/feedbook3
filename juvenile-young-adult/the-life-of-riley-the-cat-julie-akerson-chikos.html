  <title>The Life of Riley the Cat - Julie Akerson Chikos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
During a leisurely nap Riley awakens to an unsettling noise, while
investigating the source she is met by a discourteous crow. Riley is
just a kitten and naive to the outside world and questions the crow
about what he is. The crow is very pompous in his description of himself
and the encounter leaves Riley questioning her own self-worth. Riley
sets out to find her purpose and begins her journey into a strange new
world of amazing creatures. During her journey she meets many creatures
that all have very important jobs such as Simon, the Crow, who is smart
and keeps crops healthy; Cornelius, the Spider, who creates beautiful
webs and helps keep harmful insects at bay; Felix, the Honeybee, who
tends the comb, cleans the hive, gathers nectar and helps the plants to
grow which keeps the air clean; and Bernice, the Beaver, who is helpful
to other wildlife by providing winter-feed. Riley believes that her
journey will end in failure as she returns home, only to meet a curious
bat, named Bart, in her own back yard. Bart teaches Riley a valuable
lesson about her purpose and the purpose of every living creature.
