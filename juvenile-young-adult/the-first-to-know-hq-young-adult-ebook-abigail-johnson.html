          &lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t miss the second gripping and heartfelt story from the author of If &lt;em&gt;I Fix You&lt;/em&gt;! A girl&#39;s plan to find her father&#39;s birth family turns potentially devastating when the secret DNA test she has done reveals that she has a half brother her age she never knew about.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dana Fields&#39;s father never knew his parents. When Dana secretly does a DNA test for her dad, hoping to find him some distant relatives for his birthday, her entire world implodes. Instead of a few third cousins, Dana discovers a half brother her age whose very existence means her parents&#39; happy marriage is a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dana&#39;s desire to know her half brother, Brandon, and the extent of her dad&#39;s deception, clashes with her wish not to destroy her family. When she sees the opportunity to get to know Brandon through his cousin, the intense yet kind Chase, she takes it. But the more she finds out about Brandon, her father&#39;s past and the irresistible guy who&#39;ll never forgive her if he discovers the truth, the more she sees the inevitable fallout from her own lies. With her family crumbling around her, Dana must own up to her actions and find a way to heal the breach–for everyone–before they&#39;re torn apart for good.&lt;/p&gt;
