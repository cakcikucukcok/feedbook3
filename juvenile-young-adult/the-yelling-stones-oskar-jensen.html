  <title>The Yelling Stones - Oskar Jensen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Viking tale of myth and magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All is not well at the Viking court of Jelling. Home to the mysterious Yelling Stones (three witches turned into stone in the middle of screaming a fierce spell), it&#39;s always been a place of power and a haven for &#39;the old ways&#39;. But recently certain members of King Gorm&#39;s court have been muttering about &#39;modernisation&#39; - not that fourteen-year-old princess Astrid is concerned about that. She&#39;s far more worried that her family seem to want her inside sewing, or planning a marriage, rather than letting her explore the forest or ride her beautiful snow-white horse, Hestur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Astrid is about to find herself at the heart of a battle that will change her life forever. Leif, an ambitious and talented young poet, arrives at King Gorm&#39;s court with unsettling news. Leif announces he has been sent visions from the witches of the Yelling Stones, saying a dangerous and powerful force is coming - one that will change the face of Denmark  - and only Astrid and Leif can stop it. But with danger all around them, including trolls, witches and a terrifying creature called &#39;The Beast&#39;,  can they tell who the real enemy is in time to stop them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
