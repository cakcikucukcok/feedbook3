      <meta name="description" content="An Educational, Inspirational Tale About Spiders Thats Fun to Read.
Kirkus Reviews
Jerrythespider is a smart-aleck jumping spider that reluctantly joins Almas quest to vanquish the evil Sitharon.
Hanging in her web above the entrance to the old Presbyterian Church in a small California town, Alma has a nightmare about the horrible slaughter of innocent spiders by a giant flying beast, a Sitharon that lives in the ancient English woodland called Top Hat Wood. Months later, her children are born. As they balloon away to their new homes, Alma senses the presence of evil still lurking in the old woodland. She fears for the lives of her children and feels powerless against the evil Sitharon. She quietly conceives a plan to defeat the Sitharon.
Confined to her web, Alma picks Jerrythespider to be her eyes and ears in Top Hat Wood. She creates a possible future where Jerrythespider meets Dr. Greenstone, who she needs to first transport Jerrythespider to England and later to be a valuable ally. But, Dr. Greenstone is preoccupied with his vacation trip to the Sutton Hoo Farmlands. Plus, he is preparing for his expert testimony at the upcoming Moroccan-Three Murder Trial. He is oblivious to the struggle between good and evil, which is literally taking place all around him. Nonetheless, Alma plans to have Jerrythespider team up with Dr. Greenstone. TogetherAlma, Jerry, and Dr. Greenstonewill continue to seek and destroy evil wherever it shows its face." />
