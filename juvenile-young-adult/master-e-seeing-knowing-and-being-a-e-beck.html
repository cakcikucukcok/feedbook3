  <title>Master-E: Seeing, Knowing and Being - A. E. Beck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MZ, on a quest for self Master-E, consults divine wisdom from oracles and master elves and flies with fire-breathing dragons. Living as a wanted fugitive from his home planet, Clarion, MZ lives the words of Goethe in Faust. He only earns his freedom and existence who daily conquers them anew.
MZ achieves self-realization during his travel with flying dragons and down under with Subterraneans. Arrival at Wide Blue Heaven launches MZ into an unusual mastery study with a master elf and other illuminated beings. Changes in his tone, demeanor, and casual word choice hint at a leap of consciousness. He remembers that soul is a happy entity. MZ is evolving to reach balance at a quantum level of light and atoms, preparing to return to his home planet. Coming to agreement with the great forward movement of the cosmos, he adjusts his inner thoughts with this dynamic clarity. Seeing his way as a free expanded being, he knows that the moment he acts, all will be made clear. Seeing, knowing and being are his lifes goal." />
