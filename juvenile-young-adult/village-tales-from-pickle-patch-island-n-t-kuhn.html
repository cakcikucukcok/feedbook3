  <title>Village Tales from Pickle Patch Island - N. T. Kuhn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Regimole Spects has purchased a new bike for his spring holiday, which he always takes the week prior to the annual Spring Fling, with Ms. Jenny and Flash. Due to a spill from the bike, he is forced to spend the night at his friend Todeous Bastians home, where he learns of some mysterious occurrences that have the residents of Cattail Pond worried.
Soon after Regimole arrives at Ms. Jennys for his holiday, Chief McNaire arrives, and Regimole shares the concerns of their neighbors over the incidents at the pond. They decide to have Detective Daniel Squirrey investigate the incidents in the week to follow.
The week-long investigation brings forth very little new evidence in solving the mystery.  Sunday arrives, and Detective Squirrey considers skipping the Spring Fling, when the island is hit by an unexpected storm causing the event to be postponed. While Daniel, Chief McNaire, and other villagers spread the word of the postponed event, a heart-wrenching howl echoes across the island from Cattail Pond and is soon followed by the emergency alarm ringing at Ms. Jennys.
With the immediate response of their neighbors, Flash informs everyone that Regimole has disappeared." />
