  <title>GRIMM&#39;s FAIRY STORIES - 25 Illustrated Original Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by the Grimm Brothers, Illustrated by Katherine Pyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein are 25 illustrated fairy stories for children compiled by the Bros. Grimm. The stories in this 2nd volume by Evelyn Sharp are the original stories and not the retellings of fairy stories. Herein is a veritable feast of folklore drawn from ages past. In this volume you will find the perennial favourites of The Goose-Girl, Hansel And Grethel, Snow White, Cinderella, Thumbling, or Thumbelina, Rapunzel and Rumpelstiltskin plus 18 others, not yet popularised by Disney.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The full table of contents for this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Goose-Girl&lt;br /&gt;
The Little Brother And Sister&lt;br /&gt;
Hansel And Grethel&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, If I Could But Shiver!&lt;br /&gt;
Dummling And The Three Feathers&lt;br /&gt;
Little Snow White&lt;br /&gt;
Catherine And Frederick&lt;br /&gt;
The Valiant Little Tailor&lt;br /&gt;
Little Red Cap&lt;br /&gt;
The Golden Goose&lt;br /&gt;
Bearskin&lt;br /&gt;
Cinderella&lt;br /&gt;
Faithful John&lt;br /&gt;
The Water Of Life&lt;br /&gt;
Thumbling&lt;br /&gt;
Briar Rose&lt;br /&gt;
The Six Swans&lt;br /&gt;
Rapunzel&lt;br /&gt;
Mother Holle&lt;br /&gt;
The Frog Prince&lt;br /&gt;
The Travels Of Tom Thumb&lt;br /&gt;
Snow-White And Rose-Red&lt;br /&gt;
The Three Little Men In The Wood&lt;br /&gt;
Rumpelstiltskin&lt;br /&gt;
Little One-Eye, Two-Eyes And Three-Eyes&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fairy and folk tales come from the mists of time. No-one knows who wrote the originals. Whatever their source, in all you find the eternal fight of good vs evil. Almost all contain a protagonist and a hero and in all the good always wins. The Grimm brothers were not scared of including the gory details within their stories; for they were not immune to it. In 1796 they lost their father to pneumonia and with him their financial support. They had to downsize their living arrangements and rely on family handouts. In 1808 their mother died leaving the Grimm family with barely enough money to properly feed and clothe themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, these are not &amp;nbsp;the diluted, politically correct fare which Disney churns out. While the hero and his princess usually live happily ever after, the protagonist sometimes is condemned to a lifetime of exile abroad or in prison. On occasion they are sentenced to the their ultimate demise never again to practice evil on the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net sale will be donated to charities by the publisher.&lt;br /&gt;
