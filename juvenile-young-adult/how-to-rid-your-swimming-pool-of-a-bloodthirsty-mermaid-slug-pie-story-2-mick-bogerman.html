  <title>How to Rid Your Swimming Pool of a Bloodthirsty Mermaid: Slug Pie Story #2 - Mick Bogerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All Mick Bogerman wanted to do was teach his little brother how to swim in the coolest swimming pool in town. He didn&amp;#39;t ask to take care of a bunch of Sea-Monkeys while he was there. He certainly didn&amp;#39;t mean to morph one of them into a mermaid by feeding it genetically enhanced super food. No one is more surprised than Mick when the creature starts luring unsuspecting adults into the deep end of the pool. Adults who don&amp;#39;t resurface. Join Mick as he battles a powerful adversary: a bloodthirsty mermaid who hypnotizes with a golden gaze, shatters glass with a piercing shriek, and reveals her true menacing self by the light of a full moon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Lexile&amp;reg; measure 570L&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;National Indie Excellence&amp;reg; Awards selects Slug Pie Story #2 as a 2015 Finalist&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;from the backcover:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Let the mermaid re-education begin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Toss most everything you know about mermaids right into the trash. They are not sweet girls with fish tails who sing pretty songs. They are ugly, red-scaled gorillas.&amp;nbsp;They hypnotize you with their eyes and shatter glass with a shriek. But worst of the worst, they can shred you with their razor claws into bite-sized pieces. And they are always hungry.&amp;nbsp;If one of them lands in your swimming pool you better read my simple steps for How to Rid Your Swimming Pool of a Bloodthirsty Mermaid.&lt;/p&gt;" />
