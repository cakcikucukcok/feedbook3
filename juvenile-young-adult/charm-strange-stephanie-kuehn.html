  <title>Charm &amp; Strange - Stephanie Kuehn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The 2014 Winner of the William C. Morris Award&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;When you&#39;ve been kept caged in the dark, it&#39;s impossible to see the forest for the trees. It&#39;s impossible to see anything, really. Not without bars . . . &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In Stephanie Kuehn&#39;s brilliant debut &lt;i&gt;Charm &amp; Strange&lt;/i&gt;, Andrew Winston Winters is at war with himself. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&#39;s part Win, the lonely teenager exiled to a remote Vermont boarding school in the wake of a family tragedy. The guy who shuts all his classmates out, no matter the cost.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He&#39;s part Drew, the angry young boy with violent impulses that control him. The boy who spent a fateful, long-ago summer with his brother and teenage cousins, only to endure a secret so monstrous it led three children to do the unthinkable. &lt;br&gt;Over the course of one night, while stuck at a party deep in the New England woods, Andrew battles both the pain of his past and the isolation of his present.  &lt;br&gt;Before the sun rises, he&#39;ll either surrender his sanity to the wild darkness inside his mind or make peace with the most elemental of truths-that choosing to live can mean so much more than not dying.&lt;/p&gt;" />
