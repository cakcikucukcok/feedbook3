  <title>Chippewa Caw Caw - Elizabeth Whitmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;November 10th, 1975  storm clouds covered the sunset, and The Edmund Fitzgerald sailed into history. The long bulk freighter fought The Witch of November all evening. Other ships were also at the mercy of the storm but kept in constant radio contact  until three sister waves hit. Broken in half, The Fitzgerald carried her 29-crewmen to their graves at the bottom of icy Lake Superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legends said there were animals aboard. The captains huge American Crow Caw Caw witnessed everything. As the sterns huge propellers hit the air, he swooped across the long midship, snatched a tiny cat off the rigging, and flew into the witch clouds. The animals heard ancient Ottawa drums toll the death count. The Ojibwe heard them too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, The Fitzgeralds death count did not break any records. However, the next year a young Canadian sang his haunting ballad The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald. It remained popular, and nothing has done more to shed light on inland maritime safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chippewa Caw Caw delights young and old, with its historical and mythical details. Crew lists, illustrations, maps, photos, and actual ship-to-ship radio transmissions breathe life into this fictional adventure. Caw Caws journey shows us sorrow and hope  and a crow who is much revered by The First Nation People, The Chippewa (Ojibwe).&lt;/p&gt;" />
