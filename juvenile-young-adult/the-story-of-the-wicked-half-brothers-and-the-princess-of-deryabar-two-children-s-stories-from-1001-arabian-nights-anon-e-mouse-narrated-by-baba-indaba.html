Here Baba Indaba narrates the story of the Wicked Half-Brothers which also includes the story of The Princess of Deryabar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long, long ago and far, far away in the city of Harran there once lived a King who had every happiness which life and fortune could bestow save that he lacked an heir. He continually invoked on these unions the blessing of Heaven, still he remained childless; for which cause all his joy was turned to affliction, and his wealth and power and magnificence became as of no account.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, one night as he slept there appeared before him an old man of venerable appearance who addressed, saying these words, &amp;quot;The prayer of the faithful among fifty has been heard. Arise, therefore and, go into the gardens of your palace and cause the gardener to bring you a pomegranate fully ripe. Eat as many of the seeds as you desire children, and your wish shall be fulfilled.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Immediately upon awaking the King remembered the dream, and going down into the gardens of the palace he took fifty pomegranate seeds, and counting them one by one, ate them all. In due course according to the promise of his dream, each of his wives gave birth to a son all about the same time. To this, however, there was an exception, for one, whose name was Pirouz&amp;egrave;, the fairest and the most honourably born, she alone showed no sign of that which was expected of her. The King&amp;#39;s anger kindled against her because in her alone the promise of his dream was not fulfilled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The King exiles her back to her own people to remain in banishment until the will of Heaven declares itself. Pirouz&amp;egrave; is returned back to her own country, to the court of the Prince of Samaria; and there she remains.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But did she remain there forever or did events occur which overturned her banishment? You are invited to download the story here and find out what happened to Pirouz&amp;egrave;, the Princess of Deryabar?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue in the Baba Indaba Children&amp;rsquo;s Stories series has a &amp;quot;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is our hope that in looking up these place names using Google Maps, that young people will be able to see the images and read about other peoples and cultures from around the world. Through this, it is also our hope that young people will not only increase their understanding of world geography, but also increase their understanding and tolerance of other people and their cultures.&lt;br /&gt;
