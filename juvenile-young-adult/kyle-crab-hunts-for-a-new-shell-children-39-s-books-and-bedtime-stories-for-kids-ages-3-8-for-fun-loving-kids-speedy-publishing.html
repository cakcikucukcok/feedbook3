  <title>Kyle Crab Hunts For a New Shell: Children&#39;s Books and Bedtime Stories For Kids Ages 3-8 for Fun Loving Kids - Speedy Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Kyle the hermit crab loves his shells. It is nearly time for him to find a new shell because the one he is currently using is becoming very hard to get in and out of. Several shells of various sizes are on the beach, some shiny and others dull. He spends a long time thinking about and trying on several shells. Seagulls love to feast on crabs and other small sea creatures, and one has been watching this area of the beach for a while, deciding on which hermit crab to have for lunch. Will Kylie find a new shell before the seagull finds him? Are there other dangers waiting on the beach or in the water? The tide brings the kelp into the beach and also floats it out again? Will he remember this in time?" />
