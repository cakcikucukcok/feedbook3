  <title>Super Grandma and Super Grandpa: the Unknown  Superheroes Book 3 - Christine J. Gilbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Super Grandma and Super Grandpa: The Unknown Superheroes 
The sun was setting as Super Grandma, Super Grandpa, Marlen, Bobby, Sassy, and Bugger used their super magical powers, and flew into the air to rescue a family stranded in a boat on Lake Michigan. 
After the rescue, Marlen, Bobby, Sassy and Bugger became known as the Little Unknown Superheroes. As time goes by, would the other grandchildren, Roselle, Alex and Rheese be handed down the super magical powers, and become Little Unknown Superheroes, too? 
Marlen and Bobby had to promise to keep the Little Unknown Superheroes a secret, and not use their super magical powers or fly, unless given permission.
Super Grandma and Super Grandpa allowed Marlen and Bobby to fly alone with Super Grandpa secretly flying behind them. They wanted to see if the boys would keep their promise. 
Something unexpected happened while the boys were flying. They might have helped with a missing childrens case that Super Grandma, Super Grandpa, and FBI special agent Muscleman were trying to solve. 
Special Agent Muscleman and the investigators found out the criminals involved in the missing childrens case were in the United States and overseas. He contacted Agent Wannabee to tell him that Super Grandpa needed to fly overseas to work on the missing childrens case that was very dangerous. Would Super Grandma join Super Grandpa overseas or does something tragic happen?" />
