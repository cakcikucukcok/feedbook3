  <title>Blue Blue Elephant (I Am Somebody) - Wilma F. Guion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;BLUE BLUE ELEPHANT (I AM SOMEBODY)&lt;/B&gt; is a fiction storybook for ages 4-9 to enjoy as well as adults who enjoy a good children&#39;s story. The story tells about an elephant who&#39;s blue in color and because of his color he is treated like an outcast by the other animals which saddens him terribly. Later in the story he meets a bird who&#39;s purple in color. The bird informs the elephant it&#39;s okay to be different. The purple bird brings awareness that he and the elephant are beautiful regardless of the odd color they both have which later sparks a beautiful friendship between both animals.
&lt;B&gt;&lt;P&gt;BLUE BLUE ELEPHANT (I AM SOMEBODY)&lt;/B&gt; was inspired by the children I counsel and the many school shootings that have occurred in our society. This book was written to teach children that being different is a okay. I feel this book is a great tool to be used to assist children who are being teased for being overweight, wearing eye glasses, braces etc. and also can be used to inform young teasers that it&#39;s okay if a child is different." />
