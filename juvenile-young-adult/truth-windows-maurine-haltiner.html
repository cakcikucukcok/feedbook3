  <title>Truth Windows - Maurine Haltiner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Truth Windows&lt;/b&gt; centers around the construction of a straw bale house by students of Lakemont Academy, a private school in the fictional town of Lakemont, Utah. Senior Cynthia Morgan, editor of the Academy newspaper, is the main character. Juniors Matt Willits and Logan Stillwell are friends who share her affection. Matt, nicknamed Spike for his creative hairstyle, is a student at Millcreek High in nearby Granite City. Logan Stillwell, Lakemont&#39;s all-state basketball player from Chicago, is also foreman of the straw bale construction crew. Plot events include conflict among these three characters as well as problems at home for Cynthia.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Action stretches from March to June. Basketball season is almost over when Matt is arrested for setting fire to the straw bale house. With Logan&#39;s help, Cynthia sets out to prove Matt&#39;s innocence. In order to do this, she must confront antagonist Stacey Pepperwood and take upon herself the burden of uncertain truth. Caught in an emotional triangle, Cynthia must make decisions that have life-altering consequences.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Included in the novel are school scenes; basketball games; descriptions of Utah, including the Great Salt Lake and red rock country; and information on straw bale construction. Mormonism is not a major plot mover, but it rumbles on the sidelines. A special feature of straw bale houses, truth windows provide a multi-layered title for the story.
