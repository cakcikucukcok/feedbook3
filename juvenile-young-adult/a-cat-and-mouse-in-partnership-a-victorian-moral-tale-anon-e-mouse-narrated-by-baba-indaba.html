&lt;br /&gt;
A lonely cat and even lonelier mouse, against the custom of their kinds, became friends, such good friends that they decide to share a home. But is this a good idea? Winter came and things became lean and food scarce, could the cat really live with the mouse and not be tempted to be true to his nature?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Well, what happened? Did the pair make it to the end of winter without incident? To find the answer to this question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
