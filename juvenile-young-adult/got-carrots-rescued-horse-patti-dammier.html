  <title>Got Carrots? Rescued Horse - Patti Dammier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Annie and Cassie are best friends who met at Rolling Hills Equestrian School. Even though they began as strangers, their shared love for horses and adventure kept them together, especially when they helped nurse a young foal back to life. Now, winter break rapidly approaches, and the girls are excited to head back to Rolling Hills for a holiday vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reunited with their beloved rescued foal, Got Carrots, the girls are also happy to see the local cat, Jasmine. Theyre even happier to be together at Rolling Hills. Annie and Cassie will get to attend classes over their holiday vacation, where they will have the chance to learn even more about riding, grooming, and showing horses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventure seeks them out when an injured mare is brought to the equestrian school. The girls suspect this mare is somehow related to Got Carrots. Then, Jasmine goes missing, and the entire school sets out to find her. Between the search for the cat and the arrival of the mysterious mare, Annie and Cassie may learn more than they ever expected at another adventure-filled holiday at Rolling Hills!&lt;/p&gt;" />
