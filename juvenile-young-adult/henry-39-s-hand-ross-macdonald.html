  <title>Henry&amp;#39;s Hand - Ross Macdonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Henry&#39;s Hand &lt;/i&gt;is a story about the friendship between Henry, a giant, and his right hand. You see, Henry sometimes has trouble keeping track of his body parts--everything from his ears to one of his legs can fall off. Once, his eye even rolled under the couch and wouldn&#39;t come out until bedtime. But with help from Hand, Henry keeps himself together. In fact, Henry and Hand are the best of friends . . . that is, until Henry takes Hand for granted, pushes him too far, and Hand runs away. A charming tale of friendship, forgiveness, and loyalty, &lt;i&gt;Henry&#39;s Hand &lt;/i&gt;is also a quirky story for readers of all ages, especially those of us who know what it feels like to fight with your best friend.&lt;!--?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /--&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&quot;A charming story with wonderful illustrations--give Ross and Henry a hand!+?&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;b&gt;Patrick McDonnell&lt;/b&gt;, Caldecott Honor+&quot;winning author/illustrator of &lt;i&gt;Me . . . Jane&lt;/i&gt; and creator of &lt;i&gt;Mutts&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Clever, moving, and funny. What more can you ask for in a beautifully illustrated children&#39;s book?+?&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;b&gt;Graydon Carter&lt;/b&gt;, editor of &lt;i&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/i&gt; and father of five&lt;br&gt;
Â &lt;br&gt;
&quot;In Ross MacDonald&#39;s world, fiendishly silly things happen as a matter of course. In &lt;i&gt;Henry&#39;s Hand&lt;/i&gt;, our weirdly lovable hero is falling apart--literally--and chasing after the pieces. Only Henry is more human than he appears to be--which can&#39;t always be said about the rest of us!+?&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;b&gt;David Small&lt;/b&gt;, author/illustrator of &lt;i&gt;Stitches&lt;/i&gt;, a National Book Award finalist and #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Henry&#39;s Hand is funny and sweet, but creepily crazy enough to delight any young monster-lover. It delighted me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;b&gt;Paul O. Zelinsky&lt;/b&gt;, three-time Caldecott Medal-winning author/illustrator&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;STARRED REVIEW &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A good old-fashioned man/appendage love story for the ages... Kids will come for the monster and the disembodied hand. They&#39;ll stay for the story.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;All the pieces are in place, as it were, and MacDonald sets them in motion in a melodramatic plot that wraps up with a reunion worthy of applause--with both hands.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;It&#39;s a ridiculous and bizarre concept, but also filled with a lot of heart.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
--&lt;i&gt;School Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Fresh and quirky tale about the bumps that occur even in the best of friendships.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
