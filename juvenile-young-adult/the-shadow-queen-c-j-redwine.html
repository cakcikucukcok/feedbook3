To do that, Lorelai needs to use the one weapon she and Queen Irina have in common&amp;#8212;magic. She&amp;#8217;ll have to be stronger, faster, and more powerful than Irina, the most dangerous sorceress Ravenspire has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the neighboring kingdom of Eldr, when Prince Kol&amp;#8217;s father and older brother are killed by an invading army of magic-wielding ogres, the second-born prince is suddenly given the responsibility of saving his kingdom. To do that, Kol needs magic of his own&amp;#8212;and the only way to get it is to make a deal with the queen of Ravenspire, promise to become her personal huntsman&amp;#8212;and bring her Lorelai&amp;#8217;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lorelai is nothing like Kol expected&amp;#8212;beautiful, fierce, and unstoppable&amp;#8212;and despite dark magic, Lorelai is drawn in by the passionate and troubled king. Fighting to stay one step ahead of the dragon huntsman&amp;#8212;who she likes far more than she should&amp;#8212;Lorelai does everything in her power to ruin the wicked queen. But Irina isn&amp;#8217;t going down without a fight, and her final move may cost the princess the one thing she still has left to lose.&lt;/p&gt;" />
