  <title>Good and Gone - Megan Frazer Blakemore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Honest and emotionally charged, &lt;em&gt;Good and Gone &lt;/em&gt;is the story of a teenage girl who must find her way back to herself as she grapples with the truth of what her boyfriend did to her. A gripping YA that will appeal to fans of Jandy Nelson and Sara Zarr. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lexi Green&amp;#8217;s older brother, Charlie, starts plotting a road trip to find a famous musician who&amp;#8217;s been reported missing, she&amp;#8217;s beyond confused. Her brother hasn&amp;#8217;t left the couch since his girlfriend broke up with him months ago&amp;#8212;but he&amp;#8217;ll hop in a car to find some hipster rocker? Concerned at how he seems to be rebounding, Lexi decides to go along for the ride. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides, Lexi could use the distraction. The anger and bewilderment coursing through her after getting dumped by her pretentious boyfriend Seth has left her on edge. As Lexi, Charlie, and their neighbor Zack hit the road, Lexi recalls bits and pieces of her short-lived romance and sees, for the first time, what it really was: a one-sided, cold-hearted manipulation game. Not only did Seth completely isolate her, but he took something she wasn&#39;t ready to give up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The further along in their journey they get, the three uncover much more than empty clues about a reclusive rocker&amp;#8217;s whereabouts. Instead, what starts off as a car ride turns into something deeper as each of them faces questions they have been avoiding for too long. Like the real reason Charlie has been so withdrawn lately. What Seth stole from Lexi in the pool house. And if shattered girls can ever put themselves back together again. &lt;/p&gt;" />
