  <title>The Seventh Miss Hatfield - Anna Caltabiano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Romantic and action packed, &lt;em&gt;The Seventh Miss Hatfield&lt;/em&gt; is a 300-page novel about a young girl with the ability to travel through time&amp;#8212;and the secret she must protect. With an epic romance that cannot be stopped by the bounds of time, as well as deeper questions regarding immortality, &lt;em&gt;The Seventh Miss Hatfield&lt;/em&gt; is the beginning of a series perfect for fans of love stories such as &lt;em&gt;The Time Traveler&#39;s Wife&lt;/em&gt; as well as historical fiction with a fantastical twist like &lt;em&gt;The Diviners&lt;/em&gt; by Libba Bray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a child, Cynthia was lured into the home of her mysterious neighbor, Miss Hatfield. There, Miss Hatfield tells her they are both part of a long line of immortal women able to travel through time. But this gift might be more of a curse, and it comes with a price. Cynthia is beginning to lose herself: she is becoming the next Miss Hatfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before the process goes too far, Cynthia must travel back in time to turn-of-the-century New York and steal a painting. This picture might provide a clue to the whereabouts of the source of immortality, a clue that must remain hidden from the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her assignment isn&#39;t as easy as it appears, especially when Cynthia meets an attractive yet sullen boy named Henley. As their friendship grows into something stronger, Cynthia is hesitant to leave. But how can she stay with the boy she cares for when she must return to her own time before the time travel has a fatal effect on her body? And would she rather stay and die in love or leave and live alone?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And who is the mysterious stranger who shadows her from place to place? A hunter for the secret of immortality&amp;#8212;or someone who has already found it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
