  <title>THE SUN&#39;S BABIES - 84 short children&#39;s fairy stories - Edith Howes, Illustrated by Frank Watkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herein is a collection of 84 charming short stories and poems for young children about nature and the changes that occur with the seasons. As with all children&amp;rsquo;s stories, they also impart life&amp;rsquo;s lessons, &amp;nbsp;preparing our children for the futures which await them.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the stories contained in this book are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Snowdrop Baby, Little Golden Heart, Dickie Codlin, The Apple Fairy, Willy Wallflower,&lt;br /&gt;
The Cherry Children, The Dragon, Kitty Crayfish&amp;#39;s Housekeeping, Of Royal Blood, Billybuzz The Drone, Crikitty-Crik, Spinny Spider, Woollymoolly and many, many more.&lt;br /&gt;
Of particular interest are the 9 short plays in Where White Waves Play, which could be quite fun to keep children occupied on a wet winter&amp;rsquo;s day. Also of interest are the stories of the seasons which make up the last 9 stories of the volume.&lt;br /&gt;
So, we invite you to curl up with this unique sliver of Fairy culture not seen in print for over a century; and immerse yourself in the tales and fables of yesteryear.&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the net sale will be donated to charities by the publisher.&lt;br /&gt;
