  <title>Zero Hour (Department 19, Book 4) - Will Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Department 19 still stands against the darkness. But for how much longer? Book 4 in the explosive series from bestselling author, Will Hill.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Dracula continues his rise, the men and women of Department 19 wait for good news. But hope is in short supply – the country is beginning to fall apart as the public comes to terms with the horror in their midst; a cure for vampirism remains years, even decades away; and their supposed ally Valentin Rusmanov has not been heard from in weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jamie Carpenter and his friends are working hard to keep the forces of evil at bay, but it is beginning to feel like a lost cause…Until familiar faces from the past bring news that could turn the tide. News that takes Matt Browning to America on a desperate search for a miracle, and sends Jamie and Larissa Kinley into the darkest corners of eastern Europe, where something old and impossibly powerful waits for them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Something that could stop Dracula for good.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the clock is ticking.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Night is falling. And Zero Hour is almost here…&lt;/p&gt;
