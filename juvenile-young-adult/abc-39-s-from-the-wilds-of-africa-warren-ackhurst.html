  <title>Abc&#39;s from the Wilds of Africa - Warren Ackhurst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Warren Ackhurst
From a long line of storytellers, Warren honed his skills teaching Elementary school. Born and educated in Zimbabwe, he has lived in South Africa, England and now resides in Vancouver, Canada. His love of animals and Africa have inspired this book
Janice Lazzarich
Janice was born and raised in Africa. She has lived in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia. She now lives in England with her son and husband. When asked about what she misses most about Africa, she says without hesitation, The sun and the animals! She has an affinity with animals, especially those of the African bush. They represent all that is still wild in the world. By managing these magnificent animals we have learned many valuable lessons about conserving our planets resources. Hopefully these pictures will inspire young readers to look more closely at all our wildlife around us and encourage them to become aware of conservation efforts in their own communities. 
Through paintings in this book, Janice has journeyed back to Africa. We hope you enjoy the journey as much as she has." />
