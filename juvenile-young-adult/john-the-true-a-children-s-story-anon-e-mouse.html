  <title>JOHN THE TRUE - A Children’s Story - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 295&lt;br /&gt;
In this 295th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of &amp;quot;JOHN THE TRUE&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Long ago and far away in an Eastern European kingdom, a King had long been ruling but had remained unmarried. He has a younger brother John, who was so devoted to the King that everybody called him &amp;ldquo;John the True&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His nation has been at war with the Golden Horde for a twenty of years. He sees a portrait of a Princess of the Golden Horde, and falls in love with her image. There had been some talk of peace and of a betrothal between the two. But his father had died and the peace plan with him. But now the two kingdoms are at war again and it does not seem that peace will ever come.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The King begins to pine for the princess and begins to waste away. John the True steps in and offers to sail direct to capital of the Golden Horde to bring the Princess to his brother and hopefully bring peace between the nations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And so, John the True sets sail, but there are not just human forces at work trying to bring the two nations to their knees. There are also magical forces about and by a stroke of luck these are made known to John the True. However, before he can succeed at his mission and save his brother, John the True is bound by an oath that if broken will turn him to stone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who was using magic for evil ends? What was the oath and was John the True forced to break it in order for his mission to succeed? To find the answers to your questions you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read this story for yourself!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each issue also has a &amp;quot;&lt;b&gt;WHERE IN THE WORLD - LOOK IT UP&lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot; section, where young readers are challenged to look up a place on a map somewhere in the world. The place, town or city is relevant to the story. &lt;i&gt;HINT - use Google maps.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
