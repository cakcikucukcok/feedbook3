  <title>Uses for Boys - Erica Lorraine Scheidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Anna remembers a time before boys, when she was little and everything made sense. When she and her mom were a family, just the two of them against the world. But now her mom is gone most of the time, chasing the next marriage, brining home the next stepfather. Anna is left on her own--until she discovers that she can make boys her family. From Desmond to Joey, Todd to Sam, Anna learns that if you give boys what they want, you can get what you need. But the price is high--the other kids make fun of her; the girls call her a slut. Anna&#39;s new friend, Toy, seems to have found a way around the loneliness, but Toy has her own secrets that even Anna can&#39;t know.&lt;br&gt;Then comes Sam. When Anna actually meets a boy who is more than just useful, whose family eats dinner together, laughs, and tells stories, the truth about love becomes clear. And she finally learns how it feels to have something to lose--and something to offer. Real, shocking, uplifting, and stunningly lyrical, &lt;i&gt;Uses for Boys&lt;/i&gt; by Erica Lorraine Scheidt is a story of breaking down and growing up.&lt;/p&gt;" />
