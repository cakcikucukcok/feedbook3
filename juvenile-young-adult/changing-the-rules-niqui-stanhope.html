  <title>Changing The Rules - Niqui Stanhope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;From African-American fiction staple Niqui Stanhope comes &lt;/i&gt;Changing the Rules&lt;i&gt;, a romance where when it comes to love, there are no rules...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Marcel Templeton is determined never to fall for Mr. Wrong again. And no man is going to sweep her off her feet without meeting a few requirements first...Even if that means changing the rules of the dating game. Then the oh-so-fine Ian Michaels saunters into her life and threatens to ruin all her carefully laid plans...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owner of a wildly successful multi media corporation, Ian Michaels has met a lot of ladies-- but none have gotten under his skin quite like Marcel. The minute she comes crashing into his life, she starts firing away the &quot;rules&quot; that any man she dates must follow. But Ian thinks he knows what Marcel really needs-- someone to rock her world. And he&#39;s just the man to do it! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s obvious to Marcel that the man has &quot;player&quot; written all over him, but the feelings he evokes in her are oh-so-sweet and she can&#39;t quite remember why she&#39;s fighting so hard. And it&#39;s not long before she may have to admit that the passion that flares between them, may just be the reason they belong together...&lt;/p&gt;" />
