Minutes later, his parents are deadthe victims of a vicious attack on his home. With the help of a mysterious and eccentric old man named Mentor, Adam is soon propelled into a mythical adventure where his mission is to uncover the origins of the universe and a race of beings called Eternals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting sci-fi adventure tale, a young man awaits in the shadows to learn the truth of his existence and the fate of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;" />
