      <meta name="description" content="Revenge of the Cannibal Chickens is a roller coaster of hilarity, as two chooks, Dougy and Dermot, hit the road in search of the true meaning of a chicken&#39;s existence. Driven to the egging of the century by a sadistic farmer, Dougy and Dermot steal his truck and take to the highway in search of the chicken kings! On their way, they have an uncomfortable encounter at the &quot;Food Smart,&quot; a high-speed chase with the police, before coming to the understanding that a chicken&#39;s life is more than just something that goes well with potatoes and gravy. These two easy-going roosters who know nothing more than that going on within their coop, take a stand for chickens everywhere, going on a frenzy of feathered madness to exact revenge on those who barbarically use chickens for whatever purpose. They work their way up the pecking order to become a statement for chickens everywhere. Filled with laughs and life&#39;s challenges, people of all age groups can relate to the book, but especially boys ages eight to twelve. One of the classics!" />
