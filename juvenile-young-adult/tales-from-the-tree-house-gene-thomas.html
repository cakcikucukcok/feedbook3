  <title>Tales from the Tree House - Gene Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In those heady days after the end of World War II, when America soared on the wings of victory and the new prosperity of the 1950s replaced the grimness of the Depression, Gene Thomas and his brother, Vala.k.a. Gonkispent their childhood days playing in their middle-class neighborhood and having the adventures of their young lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny, sometimes sad, but always entertaining, &lt;i&gt;Tales from the Tree House&lt;/i&gt; is a collection of short stories taken from the real life exploits of the Thomas brothers. Before the television took away the wonder of childhood play and exploration, the Thomas brothers became intimately familiar with their neighborhood, staying out late, embarking on daring adventures, and playing pranks on the unsuspecting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomass lively prose evokes the sounds and sights of a time and place now lost. Whether the brothers were snatching used beer bottles (worth a fortune in candy and soda pop money!) from the construction yard next door, digging for dinosaur bones in their backyard, or building a tree house in their old oak tree, Gene and Gonki never had to tell their mother that they were bored!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reminisce about the good old days with &lt;i&gt;Tales from the Tree House&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
