      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Beauty and the beast like you&#39;ve never imagined!&quot;&lt;/i&gt; --&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Pintip Dunn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;KEEPER OF THE BEES is a tale of two teens who are both beautiful and beastly, and whose pasts are entangled in surprising and heartbreaking ways.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dresden is cursed. His chest houses a hive of bees that he can&#39;t stop from stinging people with psychosis-inducing venom. His face is a shifting montage of all the people who have died because of those stings. And he has been this way for centuries--since he was eighteen and magic flowed through his homeland, corrupting its people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He follows harbingers of death, so at least his curse only affects those about to die anyway. But when he arrives in a Midwest town marked for death, he encounters Essie, a seventeen-year-old girl who suffers from debilitating delusions and hallucinations. His bees want to sting her on sight. But Essie doesn&#39;t see a monster when she looks at Dresden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essie is fascinated and delighted by his changing features. Risking his own life, he holds back his bees and spares her. What starts out as a simple act of mercy ends up unraveling Dresden&#39;s solitary life and Essie&#39;s tormented one. Their impossible romance might even be powerful enough to unravel a centuries-old curse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each book in the Black Bird of the Gallows series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Cleaner of Bones (Prequel)&lt;br&gt;* Black Bird of the Gallows&lt;br&gt;* Keeper of the Bees&lt;/p&gt;" />
