  <title>Glitter, Paint and Homemade Cookies: One Girl&#39;s Guide to Surviving Middle School - Heather M.C. Paynter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maggie&amp;#39;s eighth grade year is the hardest one yet, filled with the drama of friends, school and family. Working toward a career in fashion design, she&amp;#39;s all about adding class to every part of her life including parties and movie nights filled with makeovers and plenty of glitter and glam. Maggie is also facing the challenges of keeping her best friends and removing the toxic ones. With the help of trusted friends, her mom and her dog Joker, Maggie is figuring out not only algebra, but also the patience it takes to tolerate a whiney classmate who always seems to get her way. When an incident at the school threatens to drag Maggie and her friends into trouble and potentially damages their future, she realizes how much some of her friends have changed. She also finds the importance of being true to herself as she prepares for high school." />
