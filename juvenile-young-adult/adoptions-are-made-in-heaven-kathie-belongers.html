  <title>Adoptions Are Made in Heaven - Kathie Belongers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Kathie Belonger was born in Wisconsin, but has been living in New Jersey for most of her married life.  She and her husband, Dave, have been married for 37 years, and are the parents of two adult children.  Kathie is a registered nurse by profession, and credits her nursing experience in Hospice as the catalyst to opening doors to new experiences in her life.  She became drawn to a world of creativity through art classes, and even pursued a career in retail, eventually becoming the owner of a craft and gift store with the help of her husband.  Currently, she is enjoying her role as a grandmother of three, and continues to pursue her love of art.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;P&gt;   I recently became inspired to write and illustrate a childrens book on adoption, because I have experienced the joy of sharing my life with my grandchildren, two of whom are adopted.  As a child, I loved reading fairy tales, so I thought this would be a wonderful way to express my deepest thoughts on adoption.  In my heart, I have come to realize that God did have a plan for our family.  &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;P&gt;    I would like to thank my daughter, Heather, and her husband, Joe, for opening the doors to the wonderful world of adoption.  I am so grateful for my grandchildren who helped to stir up the ashes of my imagination, and for my husband, Dave, and my son, Jeff, who offered their encouragement.  I would also like to extend my appreciation to Marie and Jo Lynn who offered their professional expertise, and to all of my friends and family who gently helped to guide me to this place in my heart.   &lt;/p&gt;" />
