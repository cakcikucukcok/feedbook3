  <title>Teen Hyde: High School Horror - Chandler Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cassidy Hyde is NOT having a good year. Her boyfriend cheated on her, killed her best friend&#39;s date during homecoming, and was then murdered in turn by a serial killer, and that&#39;s without counting the thing that no one knows about. (But Cassidy doesn&#39;t like to think about that.) The point is, anyone would be a little depressed and no one can blame her for looking for a little bit of help. That&#39;s where Sunshine comes in. This new experimental drug makes Cassidy feel like everything is good and she&#39;s the golden girl once again. A little memory loss feels like a small price to pay to get her life back. And the fact that boys are once again going missing (boys who Cassidy does NOT want to remember) has NOTHING to do with anything! Right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thus begins Chandler Baker&#39;s contemporary twist on Robert Louis Stevenson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Jekyll and Hyde&lt;/i&gt;, set in the town of Hollow Pines, Texas, where high school is truly horrifying.&lt;/p&gt;" />
