  <title>RAGGEDY ANN STORIES - 12 Illustrated Adventures of Raggedy Ann - Written and Illustrated by Johnny Gruelle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is for all little boys and girls who love dolls and the stories of Raggedy Andy and Raggedy Ann.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Herein you will find 12 stories of Raggedy Ann, written and illustrated by Johnny Gruelle. A companion to the Raggedy Andy Stories, it starts with Marcella visiting her Grandma, who had a quaint old house in the country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When she was there she liked to play up in the attic, for there were so many old forgotten things to find up there. One day, when she had grown tired of playing with the old spinning wheel, she curled up on an old horse-hair sofa to rest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Across the room in a dark corner she spotted an old barrel tucked under the eaves. Wondering what was in it, she set off to explore. Pulling rags and sewing off-cuts from the barrel, like a picture of a very pretty little girl with long curls tied tightly back from her forehead and wearing a long dress and queer pantaloons. And then out of the heap she pulled an old rag doll with only one shoe-button eye and a painted nose and a smiling mouth. Her dress was of soft material, blue with pretty little flowers and dots all over it. And so begins the adventures of Raggedy Ann&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These 12 Raggedy Ann stories are further brought to life with the 67 exquisite illustrations in colour also by Johnny Gruelle. The adventures are:&lt;br /&gt;
Raggedy Ann Learns A Lesson&lt;br /&gt;
Raggedy Ann And The Washing&lt;br /&gt;
Raggedy Ann And The Kite&lt;br /&gt;
Raggedy Ann Rescues Fido&lt;br /&gt;
