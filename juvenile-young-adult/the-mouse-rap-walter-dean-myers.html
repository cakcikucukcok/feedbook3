  <title>The Mouse Rap - Walter Dean Myers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;You can call me Mouse, &#39;cause that&#39;s my tag I&#39;m into it all, everything&#39;s my bag my ace is Styx, he&#39;ll always do Add Bev and Sheri, and you got my crew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;...and a crew it is! For fourteen-year-old Mouse, this summer is anything but boring. His father, who checked out from the family eight years ago, is now trying to make a comeback as a dad. Beverly, a new girl from California, seems to like locking lips with the Mouse--but she seems to like other guys, as well. Sheri is trying to persuade the gang to join a dance contest. And there&#39;s a rumor that a lot of money--the loot from a &#39;30&#39;s bank heist, to be exact--is hidden somewhere in an abandoned Harlem building, and you know the Mouse is determined to get a piece of &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; action.&lt;/p&gt;&quot;It&#39;s summer in Harlem, and The Mouse (as he calls himself) and his friends look beyond dance contests and basketball for diversion.The rumor of a huge cash stash in an abandoned building left by [a 1930s] gangster offers possibilities. . . . Tightly integrated subplots strengthen an already well-crafted novel.  Myers deftly paints a humor-laced picture of Harlem in sparkling prose, with characters that have universal appeal.&quot; &amp;#8212;BL. &lt;p&gt; &lt;awards&gt; 1991 Best Books for Young Adults (ALA)&lt;br /&gt;Children&#39;s Choices for 1991 (IRA/CBC)&lt;br /&gt;Children&#39;s Books of 1990 (Library of Congress)&lt;br /&gt;1991 Books for the Teen Age (NY Public Library)&lt;br /&gt;Parenting  Honorable Mention, Reading  Magic  Award&lt;/awards&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
