  <title>Mr. Rabbit at Home - Joel Chandler Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Buster John and Sweetest Susan and Drusilla returned home after their first visit to Mr. Thimblefinger&amp;rsquo;s queer country, a curious thing happened. The children had made a bargain to say nothing about what they had seen and heard, but one day, when there was nobody else to hear what she had to say, Sweetest Susan concluded to tell her mother something about the visit she had made next door to the world. So she began and told about the Grandmother of the Dolls, and about Little Mr. Thimblefinger, and all about her journey under the spring. Her mother paid no attention at first, but after awhile she became interested, and listened intently to everything her little daughter said. Sometimes she looked serious, sometimes she smiled, and sometimes she laughed. Sweetest Susan couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember everything, but she told enough to astonish her mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Darling, when did you dream such nonsense as that?&amp;rdquo; the lady asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a dream, mamma,&amp;rdquo; cried Sweetest Susan. &amp;ldquo;I thought it was a dream at first, but it turned out to be no dream at all. Now, please don&amp;rsquo;t ask brother about it, and please don&amp;rsquo;t ask Drusilla, for we promised one another to say nothing about it. I didn&amp;rsquo;t intend to tell you, but I forgot and began to tell you before I thought.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
A little while afterward Sweetest Susan&amp;rsquo;s mother was telling her husband about the wonderful imagination of their little daughter, and then the neighbors got hold of it, and some of the old ladies put their heads together over their teacups and said it was a sign that Sweetest Susan was too smart to stay in this world very long.&lt;br /&gt;
One day, while Drusilla was helping about the house, Sweetest Susan&amp;rsquo;s mother took occasion to ask her where she and the children went the day they failed to come to dinner.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We wuz off gettin&amp;rsquo; plums, I speck,&amp;rdquo; replied Drusilla.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why, there were no plums to get,&amp;rdquo; said the lady." />
