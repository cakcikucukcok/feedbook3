  <title>Die Once More - Amy Plum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This one-hundred-page novella picks up where the international bestselling Die for Me trilogy ended and follows the eternally irresistible Jules Marchenoir as he leaves Paris behind for a fresh start in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jules is a revenant&amp;#8212;an undead being whose fate forces him to sacrifice himself over and over again to save human lives. He&amp;#39;s spent the last century flirting his way through Paris and, most recently, falling in love with his best friend&amp;#39;s girlfriend. Loyalty and heartbreak have led him to choose a new life in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separated from his friends and his home, Jules is adrift in this dangerous new world, facing unknown enemies . . . until he meets a revenant named Ava. Though the battle for France has been won, an epic war between good and evil has just begun in the Big Apple, and Ava needs Jules&amp;#39;s help to uncover the key to an American victory. Jules finds himself in the same position he crossed an ocean to escape: at risk of losing his immortal existence as well as his heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epic Reads Impulse is a digital imprint with new releases each month.&lt;/p&gt;" />
