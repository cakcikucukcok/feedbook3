  <title>THE FISHERMAN AND THE GENIE - A Children’s Story from 1001 Arabian Nights - Anon E Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 223&lt;br /&gt;
In this 223rd issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the Arabian Nights story of &amp;ldquo;The Fisherman and the Genie&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A poor fisherman toils day in and day out eaking a meagre living from his daily catch. One day he casts for the first time and his net is far heavier than usual so that he could scarcely draw it in; yet when at last he got it to shore all that it contained was the carcass of an ass.&lt;br /&gt;
He cast a second time, and found the draught of the net even heavier than before. But again he was doomed to disappointment, for this time it contained nothing but a large earthenware jar full of mud and sand. His third attempt brought him only a heap of broken old bottles and potsherds: fortune seemed to be against him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then, committing his hope to Providence, he cast for the fourth and last time; and once more the weight of the net was so great that he was unable to haul it. When at last he got it to land, he found that it contained a brazen vessel, its mouth closed with a leaden stopper, bearing upon it the seal of King Solomon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The sight cheered him. &amp;quot;This,&amp;quot; thought he, &amp;quot;I can sell in the market, where I may get for it enough to buy a measure of corn; and, if one is to judge by weight, what lies within may prove yet more valuable.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thus reckoning, he prised out the stopper with his knife, and turning the vessel upside down looked for the contents to follow. Great was his astonishment when nothing but smoke came out of it. The smoke rose in a thick black column and spread like a mist between earth and sky, till presently, drawing together, it took form; and there in its midst stood a mighty Genie, whose brows touched heaven while his feet rested upon ground. His head was like a dome, his hands were like flails, and his legs like pine trees; his mouth was black as a cavern, his nostrils were like trumpets, his eyes blazed like torches, and his wings whirled round and over him like the simoom of the desert.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At so fearful a sight all the fisherman&amp;#39;s courage oozed out of him; but the Genie, perceiving him, cried with a loud voice, &amp;quot;O, Solomon, Prophet of God, slay me not, for never again will I withstand thee in word or deed!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Alas!&amp;quot; said the fisherman, &amp;quot;I am no prophet; and as for Solomon, he has been dead for nearly two thousand years. I am but a poor fisherman whom chance has knocked by accident against thy door.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;In that case,&amp;quot; answered the Genie, &amp;quot;know that presently thou wilt have to die.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Heaven forbid!&amp;quot; cried the fisherman; &amp;quot;or, at least, tell me why! Surely it might seem that I had done thee some service in releasing thee.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hear first my story,&amp;quot; said the Genie, &amp;quot;then shalt thou understand.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
