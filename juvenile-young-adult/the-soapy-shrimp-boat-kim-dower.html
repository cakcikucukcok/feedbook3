  <title>The Soapy Shrimp Boat - Kim Dower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Come Spend the day with good ole Soapy Shrimp Boat on the Bayou! See what happens when one slimy shrimp wiggles his way aboard the glistening clean Cajun crew. Crack up with the chaos that ensues as characters clash in this comic adventure! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim Dowers is a Southern Louisiana author and illustrator who resides with her husband in Southwest Louisiana. Kim is the third oldest child in a family of 14. She has a Masters degree in Education Administration. She is also a childrens church minister at the church she attends. Kim has previously illustrated three childrens books for author Jody Carroll. They are Mitsy Morgan: Six Monkeys Past Midnight, Mitsy Morgan: The Lemonade List, and The Adventures of Marty Morgan in Pirate Paradise. Several of the books are known world-wide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kim is a speaker at various events and enjoys landscaping, crabbing, floundering, fishing with her husband, reads every chance she gets, and loves to collect old duck decoys. Her vivid personality has attracted children for years and her ability to liven up a room is unmatched. Kims bright bold illustrations convey a fun and imaginative world that children can join in and relate to. Kim plans to continue her Louisiana series with Choupique Bayou Books, sharing the love of the Cajun culture she enjoys so much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choupique Bayou Books is proud to introduce their new partners Mitsy Morgan Books, and BIC Media Solutions! &lt;/p&gt;" />
