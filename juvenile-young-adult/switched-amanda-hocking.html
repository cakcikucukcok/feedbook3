Every encounter leaves her deeply shaken...though it has more to do with her fierce attraction to him than she&#39;d ever admit.  But it isn&#39;t long before he reveals the truth:  Wendy is a changeling who was switched at birth--and he&#39;s come to take her home.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Wendy&#39;s about to journey to a magical world she never knew existed, one that&#39;s both beautiful and frightening.
