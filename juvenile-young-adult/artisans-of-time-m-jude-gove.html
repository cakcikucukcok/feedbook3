      <meta name="description" content="For seven high school students from California, a routine geology field trip becomes an adventure that spans time. Splitting off from the rest of the group, the seven students discover a cave opening and decide to explore. There&#39;s no turning back as Rick, Erica, Dianna, Mike, Dan, Joe, and Ronda find themselves in the strange surrounding of another world. This begins a journey that tests the special skills and talents of each person in the group.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The teens find they are in the land of the Ge&#39;mell, a group of people living in a fragile world torn between technological advancement and utter destruction. The Ge&#39;mell are true artisans of time travel, but even they need help, and the open-minded students from Earth come to the rescue. With their creative thinking, bravery, and diplomatic approach, not only do the teens help the Ge&#39;mell, but they save Earth at the same time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Blending science fiction and fantasy, this trilogy-&lt;i&gt;Rings of the Gods; Time, Friend, and Foe; and Genetic Code&lt;/i&gt;-captivates with its characters, its battles, and its adventure. This epic tale tests the realities of time." />
