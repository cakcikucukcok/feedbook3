  <title>The Little Crow That Didn’T Know How to Fly - Don Adolfson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Little Crow That Didnt Know How to Fly actually came about from a real life drama that happened over the course of several weeks in my front yard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That year, there was a whole flock of crows, and talk about noisy, they would caw from morning to night. And sometimes at night as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Little Crow was on the ground under the tree, it was quite comical to watch him and his mother cawing at one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could go on, telling you more, but you will have to read the story to find out the beginning......because with this story, there is no ending........&lt;/p&gt;" />
