  <title>Woodland Magic - Kimberlee Hutnik Knepp, Martin Schorzman, John Kautz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Long ago, a young mother living in a poor village struggles to keep her family comfortable during hard times. She keeps an eye on the other villagers as well and does what she can to make their lives easier, too. One evening, she goes out into the forest to collect pinecones, which give off a soft glow at night when added to the fires at home. She is overcome by weariness and stops to rest under a pine tree. Soothed by the peaceful surroundings, she quickly falles into a deep sleep. The woodland fairies, comng out to dance among the moonbeams, find her sound asleep near the forest glade. They gather around her and decide to reward her for her kindheartedness and caring nature, so with a sprinkle of pixie dust and a little bit of magic, they turn her baskets of pinecones into a marvelous treasure that she shares with the whole village." />
