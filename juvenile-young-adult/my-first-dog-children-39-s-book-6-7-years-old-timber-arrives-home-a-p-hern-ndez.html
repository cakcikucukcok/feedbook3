  <title>My First Dog: Children&#39;s Book (6-7 Years Old). Timber Arrives Home - A.P. Hernández</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sophie is seven years old and wants a dog.&lt;br/&gt;
She wants it to play tea party with, to brush its hair and to ride on its back like a real rider. &lt;br/&gt;
Sofia wants the dog, and she wants it now. Almost all his friends at school have a pet except her.&lt;br/&gt;
So, after a lot of insisting, she ends up convincing his parents to let her have a dog.&lt;br/&gt;
And so, a good day... Timber Comes Home!&lt;br/&gt;
But Timber is not willing to play with Sophie. Timber does not like to have tea, he does not like to be brushed or, much less, he wants no one to climb on his back.&lt;br/&gt;
Thus, Sophie understands that Timba is not a toy and that it will be essential to gain his trust and affection.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;A book for kids recommended for children from 6 to 7 years old.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
With this children&#39;s book, little ones will understand that &lt;b&gt;adopting a dog is a great responsibility.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Through Sophie’s adventures, it facilitates the reflection on &lt;b&gt;the time that a dog requires&lt;/b&gt;, the &lt;b&gt;importance of taking it to the vet&lt;/b&gt;, how important it is &lt;b&gt;to take it for a walk every day&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;to do exercises&lt;/b&gt; with him, and &lt;b&gt;how to educate him.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;My first Dog&quot; is a first-learning book apt to be read aloud to the little ones. It is also useful for children to undertake their reading adventure for themselves.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;" />
