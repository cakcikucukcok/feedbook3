  <title>MY BOOK OF FAVOURITE FAIRY TALES - 16 Illustrated Children&#39;s Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled and Retold by Capt. Edric Vredenburg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Here they are again, the old, old stories, the very best; dear Cinderella, wicked old Bluebeard, tiny Thumbling (also known as Thumbelina,) beautiful Beauty and the ugly Beast, and a host of others. But the old stories are always new, and always must be so, because there are always new children to read them to every day, and to these, of course, these old tales might have been written yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;
But the stories in this book are new in another way. Look how the Princes and Princesses are clothed, look at their beautiful setting in the 12 wonderful, colour pictures and 75 pen and ink drawings by Jennie Harbour! Have you ever seen such charming princes and lovely princesses, such dainty grace and delicate feeling?&lt;br /&gt;
What would our grandfathers and grandmothers have said of such a book! They would have thought there was magic in the brush and pencil.&lt;br /&gt;
Surely we are the favoured generation when we see before us, the old, old fairy tales, which are ever new, dressed in such a beautiful colour and splendid fashion!&lt;br /&gt;
The 15 stories in this volume are:&lt;br /&gt;
The Goose Girl&lt;br /&gt;
Little Snow-White&lt;br /&gt;
Cinderella&lt;br /&gt;
Princess Goldenhair&lt;br /&gt;
Little Red Riding Hood&lt;br /&gt;
The White Fawn&lt;br /&gt;
Hansel And Grethel&lt;br /&gt;
Snow-White And Rose-Red&lt;br /&gt;
The Sleeping Beauty&lt;br /&gt;
Prince Ch&amp;eacute;ri&lt;br /&gt;
The White Cat&lt;br /&gt;
Bluebeard&lt;br /&gt;
Beauty And The Beast&lt;br /&gt;
Tufty Riquet&lt;br /&gt;
Thumbling&lt;br /&gt;
