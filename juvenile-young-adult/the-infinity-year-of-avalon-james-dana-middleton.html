  <title>The Infinity Year of Avalon James - Dana Middleton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Avalon James and Atticus Brightwell have a secret--one that they aren&#39;t allowed to discuss with anyone. This secret is shared between two best friends. When you and your best friend turn ten years old magical things are said to happen. You both will receive some kind of magical power. It can be a power you can call on time and time again. Or it can be a power that comes once when you need it most.  It&#39;s your Infinity Year and the possibilities are endless.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The past year hasn&#39;t been great with her family being torn apart and bullying at school, so Avalon is depending on her magical ability to appear soon and help. With the clock ticking and her eleventh birthday approaching, which would be the end of her powers, Avalon&#39;s hopes are running high. Will she and Atticus get the powers they so desperately want and need?  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dana Middleton&#39;s debut novel is a wonderfully enchanting story of the possibility of magic and the even more magical bond between two best friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
