  <title>This Is Not a Test - Courtney Summers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the end of the world. Six students have taken cover in Cortege High but shelter is little comfort when the dead outside won&#39;t stop pounding on the doors. One bite is all it takes to kill a person and bring them back as a monstrous version of their former self. To Sloane Price, that doesn&#39;t sound so bad. Six months ago, &lt;i&gt;her &lt;/i&gt;world collapsed and since then, she&#39;s failed to find a reason to keep going. Now seems like the perfect time to give up. As Sloane eagerly waits for the barricades to fall, she&#39;s forced to witness the apocalypse through the eyes of five people who actually &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to live. But as the days crawl by, the motivations for survival change in startling ways and soon the group&#39;s fate is determined less and less by what&#39;s happening outside and more and more by the unpredictable and violent bids for life--&lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;death--inside. When everything is gone, what do &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;hold on to?&lt;/p&gt;" />
