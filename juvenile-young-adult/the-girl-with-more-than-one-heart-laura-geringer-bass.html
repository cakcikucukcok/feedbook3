  <title>The Girl with More Than One Heart - Laura Geringer Bass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;There are times we all feel we need more than one heart to get through. When Briana&#39;s father dies, she imagines she has a new heart growing inside her. It speaks to her in her Dad&#39;s voice. Some of its commands are mysterious. &lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt;&lt;I&gt;Find Her!  &lt;/I&gt;it says. &lt;I&gt;Be Your Own!  &lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;BR /&gt; How can Briana &quot;be her own&quot; when her grieving mother needs her to take care of her demanding little brother all the time? When all her grandpa can do is tell stories instead of being the &quot;rock&quot; she needs? When her not-so-normal home life leaves no time to pursue her dream of writing for the school literary magazine? When the first blush of a new romance threatens to be nipped in the bud? Forced by the loss of her favorite parent to see all that was once familiar with new eyes, Briana draws on her own imagination, originality, and tender loving heart to discover a surprising path through the storm.  &lt;BR /&gt;  &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
