  <title>Forest Enchanted - Frances Jane Lea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Step into a world where magic abounds and anything is possible.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Zach is pretty sure his step-dad was joking when he said they had to move because their house was infested with brain eating spiders. On the day he arrives at the new family home at the edge of a vast forest, he follows a strange cat to discover a world different from anything he&amp;rsquo;s ever seen before.&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Although he doesn&amp;rsquo;t always get along with his older brother Max, or his step-brother Griffin, Zach agrees to show them the old abandoned shack he discovered in the woods. When they arrive at the shack the boys are amazed to find that their toy swords have transformed into real ones! Then they find a hidden map inside the shack. Where will it lead them?&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;It seems anything is possible in a world with talking animals, exploding marbles, witches and goblins, swords, and even a baby dragon!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Dragonwood Adventures Series is exciting, fast paced, and sure to delight young readers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
