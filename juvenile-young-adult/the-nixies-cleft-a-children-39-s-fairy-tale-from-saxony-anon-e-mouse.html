  <title>THE NIXIES’ CLEFT - A Children&#39;s Fairy Tale from Saxony - Anon E. Mouse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 265&lt;br /&gt;
In this 265th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; series, Baba Indaba narrates the story of &amp;ldquo;THE NIXIES&amp;rsquo; CLEFT.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
ONCE upon a time, not far from the little village of Dietenhein, in Saxony, there stands, on the bank of the Zschopau river, a great rock full of narrow clefts. There dwelt in a cleft of this rock the King of the Nixies, who held sway over all the water-folk of the Zschopau and its tributary rivers.&lt;br /&gt;
No one could have told, that looking by day at the outside of that rugged cliff, and at the narrow entrance of the Nixies&amp;rsquo; dwelling, how beautiful it was when night fell, and the moonbeams lit up the broad sweep of the river and crept in among the dusky trees upon its banks. For then you might see how all the face of the cliff seemed to melt away like a dream, and how a stately castle, built of shining crystal, arose in its place. And if you looked carefully you would see light figures, clad in misty draperies, moved airily to and fro to sounds of such exquisite music.&lt;br /&gt;
The Nixi King had three beautiful daughters, and doubtless they often invited their friends from the neighbouring streams and caves to the palace to dance.&lt;br /&gt;
When the new moon rose at a favourable time, the Nix-maidens went to the village dances at Dietenhein. They were the despair of all the village youths, and the envy of the maidens.&lt;br /&gt;
But kind and sweet as they were, no-one ever heard a word pass their lips.&lt;br /&gt;
Over the years many young men chased the three maidens but none were fleet enough to catch them for it was like trying to catch the wind. Over the centuries they continued to dance and bewitch the young men of Dietenhein. But one day there came back to Dietenhein a young soldier by the name of Veit, the finest lad and the most stalwart the village had ever seen. All the maidens strove to win his favour, but among them all he had eyes for one alone&amp;mdash;Katrine, the miller&amp;rsquo;s daughter. Over the days and weeks their love blossomed and each only had eyes and words for the other.&lt;br /&gt;
Now about this time there was to be a fine dance in the village. Many whispered abd wondered if the Nixies will be seen at the dance?&lt;br /&gt;
But what happened next you may ask? Did the Nixies attend and what befell Veit? What did Katrine do? This is where our story really begins. Are you still asking what happened? Well you&amp;rsquo;ll have to download and read the story to find out what happened to Veit, Katrine, the Nixy maidens, their castle and their father the Nixy King.&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
