Population: 814.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen&amp;#39;s summer starts looking up when he meets punk girl Cara and her charismatic twin brother, Devon. With Cara, he feels safe and understood&amp;#8212;and yeah, okay, she&amp;#39;s totally hot. In Devon and his group, he sees a chance at making real friends. Only, as the summer presses on, and harmless nights hanging out in the cemetery take a darker turn, Stephen starts to suspect that Devon is less a friend than a leader. And he might be leading them to a very sinister end. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
