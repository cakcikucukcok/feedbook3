  <title>White Child: Book I - Official Edition - Francesca T Barbini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When 12 year old Julius McCoy is told that he has been selected to join the elite Zed Lunar Academy, he is over the moon...literally. It promises to be a year of neck-breaking races in The Hologram Palace, spaceship-pilot training and of course, developing his own very special mind-skills.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yet even as he begins to get a grip on his fantastic abilities, strange things start to happen around him. Who are the three mysterious men hanging about in Satras, the moon capital - particularly their sinister leader in the red cap, who seems to know a lot more than he should about Julius?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And what of the growing threat of the evil Queen Salgoria, head of the technologically-gifted Arneshian outcasts, who are making ominous advances again? It&amp;rsquo;s all a lot more than a young boy should be expected to deal with. Yet, little does Julius realise exactly how critical he will be to the fate of Zed, and ultimately, Earth itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tijaran Tales: White Child is a sci-fi story for children of all ages, about the trials of growing up, the joy of friendship, standing up for what&amp;rsquo;s right, and how much fun kids can have when they&amp;rsquo;re able to manipulate energy with the power of their minds. The adventure begins here!&lt;/p&gt;" />
