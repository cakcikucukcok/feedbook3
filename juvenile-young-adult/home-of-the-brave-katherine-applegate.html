  <title>Home of the Brave - Katherine Applegate</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bestselling author Katherine Applegate presents &lt;i&gt;Home of the Brave&lt;/i&gt;, a beautifully wrought middle grade novel about an immigrant&#39;s journey from hardship to hope. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kek comes from Africa. In America he sees snow for the first time, and feels its sting. He&#39;s never walked on ice, and he falls. He wonders if the people in this new place will be like the winter - cold and unkind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Africa, Kek lived with his mother, father, and brother. But only he and his mother have survived, and now she&#39;s missing. Kek is on his own. Slowly, he makes friends: a girl who is in foster care; an old woman who owns a rundown farm, and a cow whose name means &quot;family&quot; in Kek&#39;s  native language. As Kek awaits word of his mother&#39;s fate, he weathers  the tough Minnesota winter by finding warmth in his new friendships, strength in his memories, and belief in his new country. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Home of the Brave&lt;/i&gt; is a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
