Bugs
Bugs
High or low
Friends or foes
Squeals or tears
Phobias or fears
They get in your hair
They get in your eyes
Find here or find them there
Little bugs are found everywhere . . .
This is a fun children&#39;s picture book, which adults can easily relate too and enjoy with their children.
It helps children of a early age to realise that bugs are all around and hopefully teaches them something about bugs habitats and there is no real need to fear bugs.
But also to be aware that some bugs can be harmful to them.
I have used the word Bugs loosely in this book and this needs to be taken into account when considering this book. Some of the creatures I have used are not true Bugs, but are generally considered as Bugs or Insects by the general public. An example of this is my use of spiders, which are not true Bugs." />
