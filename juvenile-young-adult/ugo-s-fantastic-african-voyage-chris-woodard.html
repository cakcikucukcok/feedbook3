  <title>Ugo’S Fantastic African Voyage - Chris Woodard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ugo doesnt think of himself as that different. Hes just like a bunch of other kids at schoolexcept for his name. Ugo is a Nigerian name, and due to its uniqueness, he is bullied and made to feel isolated and alone. No one seems to understand what hes going through. One day at the market, he sits and just wishes someone would understand and make him feel better.
Then, out of nowhere, he hears a voice. The unfamiliar boy on the bench looks and speaks like no one Ugo has ever met, but he says his father owns a store called African Magic. Strangely, the boy gives Ugo a little pebble, and that pebble takes Ugo on a wild journey all the way to Africa. There he gets the chance to learn about his heritage and his name.
Ugos Fantastic African Voyage is one boys journey of self-discovery as he uncovers his ability to overcome the pain of bullying while learning about the majestic land of Africa. Truth is, everyone can be bullied: children, adolescents, and even adults. Anyone can feel like an outcast. Yet the important thing to remember is that its our unique qualities that make us special. All we need is the courage to accept ourselves and others, differences and all." />
