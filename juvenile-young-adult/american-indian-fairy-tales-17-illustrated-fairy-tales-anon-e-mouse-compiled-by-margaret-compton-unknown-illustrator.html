  <title>AMERICAN INDIAN FAIRY TALES - 17 Illustrated Fairy Tales - Anon E. Mouse, Compiled by Margaret Compton, Unknown Illustrator</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a collection of Native American folklore, retold for children and young adults, compiled over a century ago. Within you will find stories like Snowbird and the Water Tiger, The Coyote or Prairie Wolf, How Mad Buffalo Fought the Thunder-Bird, The Red Swan, The Bended Rocks and many more. You will even find a description of Iagoo the storyteller.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the second edition of this book, which was originally published in 1895 and titled &lt;i&gt;Snow Bird and the Water Tiger and other American Indian Tales&lt;/i&gt;. The uncredited illustrations are nice examples of children&amp;#39;s book art from the period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The compiler, probably not a Native American herself, drew on authentic lore from a wide variety of culture regions, but sprinkled in stereotypical language and anomalous items from the woodland area like &amp;quot;squaw,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;papoose,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;wigwam&amp;quot;. However, the author was obviously well-intentioned and, for her time, appears to have had a fairly progressive attitude. Notably, she preserves some of the motifs in the stories such as grotesque monsters and cross-dressing, which some other children&amp;#39;s book authors of her day (and ours) might have glossed over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10% of the profit from the sale of this book will be donated to charities.&lt;br /&gt;
