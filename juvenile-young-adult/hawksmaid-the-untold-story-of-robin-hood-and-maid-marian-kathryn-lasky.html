      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before she was Maid Marian, she was Matty. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matty has been raised to dance well, embroider exquisitely, and marry nobly. But when Matty&#39;s mother is murdered before her very eyes and her father, a nobleman, is reduced to poverty, Matty&#39;s life changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the daughter of Nottingham&#39;s most famous falconer, she finds a new destiny in the hawks her father keeps. She begins to understand their thoughts and even speak their language. The beautiful merlin Marigold becomes Matty&#39;s closest winged companion and her fiercest ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a treacherous time in England. The sheriff of Nottingham is rising to power, and a true king has been kidnapped. Determined to fight, Matty&#39;s friend Fynn becomes Robin Hood. As Maid Marian, Matty joins Fynn and his Merry Men, famously robbing from the rich to give to the poor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You thought that you knew the legend, but this is the untold story. Bestselling author Kathryn Lasky soars to magnificent new heights here, giving us a bold tale of bravery and romance.&lt;/p&gt;" />
