      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An event that changed five teens&amp;rsquo; lives &amp;hellip; and could alter the future of the world. Sam Becker has been suffering nightmares and waking up to disturbing paintings he doesn&amp;rsquo;t recall creating. He&amp;rsquo;s also plagued by an inability to remember his childhood and the details of a night that changed him forever. When he encounters spiteful, fallen angels who are intent on destroying him, the vital memories return and it is clear he and his childhood friends are in grave danger. When Sam contacts Jonah, Carly, Jenna, and J, it becomes clear they too are suffering the same nightmares. Sam summons them to St. Louis where they find they are Watchers&amp;mdash;part of a prophecy that will help end a war between fallen angels intent on destroying humanity and the guardian angel forces of heaven. Their Watcher gift allows them to see what rages around them, but when the fallen discover the Watchers&amp;rsquo; abilities are growing, the five are placed in mortal danger &amp;hellip; and all may not survive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
