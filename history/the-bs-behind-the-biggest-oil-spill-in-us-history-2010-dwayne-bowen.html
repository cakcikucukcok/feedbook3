  <title>The Bs Behind the Biggest Oil Spill in Us History: 2010 - Dwayne Bowen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While working at the Gulf Coast and experiencing the oil spill for himself, Dwayne witnessed all the wrong that took place and decided to write a book about the lies and really show America the truth on the biggest oil spill in U.S. history.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Any questions that were unanswered to the public shall be answered in this book.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Here are a couple of quotes from the author to his readers:
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Word to the wise; Everyone who breathes life is only &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; granted one life, one environment in which we the &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; human race live it but when we the human race toxify &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; the food, water, air and lands, its only a matter time &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; before we all succumb due to others wrong doings and &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; abuse to the world.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; Very few people admit the truth; most people deny the &lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; truth, the rich pays to hide the truth and the less fortunate 
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center justify, body text=&quot;blue&quot;&gt; die never knowing the truth." />
