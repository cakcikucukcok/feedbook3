  <title>Thank You for Your Service - David Finkel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Now a Major Motion Picture Directed by &lt;i&gt;American Sniper &lt;/i&gt;Writer Jason Hall and Starring Miles Teller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wars of the past decade have been covered by brave and talented reporters, but none has reckoned with the psychology of these wars as intimately as the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Finkel. &lt;i&gt;For The Good Soldiers&lt;/i&gt;, his bestselling account from the front lines of Baghdad, Finkel embedded with the men of the 2-16 Infantry Battalion during the infamous &quot;surge,&quot; a grueling fifteen-month tour that changed them all forever. In Finkel&#39;s hands, readers can feel what these young men were experiencing, and his harrowing story instantly became a classic in the literature of modern war. &lt;br&gt;     In &lt;i&gt;Thank You for Your Service&lt;/i&gt;, Finkel has done something even more extraordinary. Once again, he has embedded with some of the men of the 2-16--but this time he has done it at home, here in the States, after their deployments have ended. He is with them in their most intimate, painful, and hopeful moments as they try to recover, and in doing so, he creates an indelible, essential portrait of what life after war is like--not just for these soldiers, but for their wives, widows, children, and friends, and for the professionals who are truly trying, and to a great degree failing, to undo the damage that has been done.&lt;br&gt;     The story Finkel tells is mesmerizing, impossible to put down. With his unparalleled ability to report a story, he climbs into the hearts and minds of those he writes about. &lt;i&gt;Thank You for Your Service&lt;/i&gt; is an act of understanding, and it offers a more complete picture than we have ever had of these two essential questions: When we ask young men and women to go to war, what are we asking of them? And when they return, what are we thanking them for? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Nonfiction Books of 2013 &lt;br&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Top 10 Books of the Year &lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;Notable Book of 2013&lt;br&gt;An NPR Best Book of 2013&lt;br&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Kirkus Reviews &lt;/i&gt;Best Nonfiction Book of 2013&lt;/p&gt;" />
