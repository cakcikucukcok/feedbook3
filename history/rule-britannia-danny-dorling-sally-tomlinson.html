  <title>Rule Britannia - Danny Dorling, Sally Tomlinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Books on Brexit explaining how and why parts of Britain voted to leave the European Union are falling hot off the press. Some promise the full story of the political manoeuvring that got us to this point, others promise to make sense of the vote, with a couple focusing on the supposed evils of immigration and Islam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Rule Britainnia&lt;/i&gt;, Danny Dorling and Sally Tomlinson tell a different story. They argue that the EU referendum was part of a last gasp of empire working its way out of the British psyche. It is a view of empire largely based on myth and nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dorling and Tomlinson are not arguing for any particular position, but suggest that whatever the next year brings Britain will be much diminished by the process of trying to leave the EU, and that there is no welcoming Empire, Commonwealth, or other set of countries, ready to quickly embrace new trading relationships with us. They do, however, recognise the potential to reshape a post-Brexit Britain, assuming that the UK can accept a world order not based on the past.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Rule Britannia - Danny Dorling, Sally Tomlinson</i></b> | In Rule Britannia, Danny Dorling and Sally Tomlinson argue that the vote to leave the EU was the last gasp of the old empire working its way out of the British psyche. Fuelled by a misplaced nostalgia, the result was driven by a lack of knowledge of Britain’s imperial history, by a profound anxiety about Britain’s status today, and by a deeply unrealistic vision of our future.<br /><b><i>Home Page | RULE BRITANNIA - Danny Dorling</i></b> | “Danny Dorling and Sally Tomlinson’s Rule Britannia makes for essential reading on the connections between Brexit and Britain’s colonial history. It is a highly readable book and, despite the gravity of its content, a joy to read in being replete with humour and anecdotal gems.<br /><b><i>Rule Britannia: Brexit and the End of Empire: Dorling ...</i></b> | In 'Rule Britannia', Danny Dorling and Sally Tomlinson present a powerful and provocative critique of the Brexit process. The book is very readable, authoritative and well documented (with no fewer than 40 pages of footnotes).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Rule Britannia - Danny Dorling, Sally Tomlinson</a> </h3></p><hr/>
