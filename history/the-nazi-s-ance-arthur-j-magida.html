  <title>The Nazi Séance - Arthur J. Magida</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;World War I left Berlin, and all of Germany, devastated.  Charlatans and demagogues eagerly exploited the desperate crowds. Fascination with the occult was everywhere - in private séances, personalized psychic readings, communions with the dead - as people struggled to escape the grim reality of their lives. In the early 1930s, the most famous mentalist in the German capital was Erik Jan Hanussen, a Jewish mind reader originally from Vienna who became so popular in Berlin that he rubbed elbows with high ranking Nazis, became close with top Storm Troopers, and even advised Hitler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Called &quot;Europe&#39;s Greatest Oracle Since Nostradamus,&quot; Hanussen assumed he could manipulate some of the more incendiary personalities of his time just as he had manipulated his fans. He turned his occult newspaper in Berlin into a Nazi propaganda paper, personally assured Hitler that the stars were aligned in his favor, and predicted the infamous Reichstag Fire that would solidify the Nazis&#39; grip on Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasoned with ruminations about wonder and magic (and explanations of Hanussen&#39;s tricks), &lt;i&gt;The Nazi Séance&lt;/i&gt; is a disturbing journey into a Germany as it descends into madness--aided by a &quot;clairvoyant&quot; Jew oblivious to the savagery of men who pursued a Reich they fantasized would last 1,000 years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
