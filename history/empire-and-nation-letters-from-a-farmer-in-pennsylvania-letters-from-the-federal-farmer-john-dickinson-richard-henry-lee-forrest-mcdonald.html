Lee wrote in 1787 as an Anti-Federalist, and his <i>Letters</i> gained, as Charles Warren has noted, "much more widespread circulation and influence" than even the heralded <i>Federalist Papers</i>. Both sets of <i>Letters</i> deal, McDonald points out, "with the same question: the never-ending problem of the distribution of power in a broad and complex federal system." The Liberty Fund second edition includes a new preface by the editor in which he responds to research since the original edition of 1962. </p><p><b>Forrest McDonald</b> is Professor of History at the University of Alabama and author also of <b><i>E Pluribus Unum,</i></b> among other works.</p>
