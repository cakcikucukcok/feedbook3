  <title>Liars, Thieves and Other Sinners on the Bench - Jo Carson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Haunting and funny, full of folk wisdom and unfl inching honesty.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, on the work of Jo Carson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She is a quintessential community artist with a true ear for the way people talk and what they really mean to say.

In performance, these works have illuminated and invigorated the communities in which they were forged, as the people see themselves onstage in a new light. This book collects Carson&amp;rsquo;s favorite excerpts from the plays&amp;mdash;stories that range from the homespun to the extraordinary and together create a portrait of America in an amazing diversity and authenticity of voices. They are slices of life, passed beyond the circle of family and neighbors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jo Carson&lt;/b&gt; is a writer and performer living in John City, Tennessee. She has published award-winning plays, short stories, children&amp;rsquo;s books, essays, poems, and other work, and for years was a commentator on National Public Radio&amp;rsquo;s &lt;i&gt;All Things Considered&lt;/i&gt;.
