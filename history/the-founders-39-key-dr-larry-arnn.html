  <title>The Founders&#39; Key - Dr. Larry Arnn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Today the integrity and unity of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution are under attack by the Progressive political movement. And yet, writes Larry P. Arnn:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;“The words of the Declaration of Independence ring across the ages. The arrangements of the Constitution have a way of organizing our actions so as to produce certain desirable results, and they have done this more reliably than any governing instrument in the history of man. Connect these arrangements to the beauty of the Declaration and one has something inspiring and commanding.”&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;From Chapter 2,&amp;nbsp;&lt;I&gt;The Founders’ Key&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Dr. Arnn, president of Hillsdale College, reveals this integral unity of the Declaration and the Constitution. Together, they form the pillars upon which the liberties and rights of the American people stand. United, they have guided history’s first self-governing nation, forming our government under certain universal and eternal principles. Unfortunately, the effort to redefine government to reflect “the changing and growing social order” has gone very far toward success. Politicians such as Franklin Roosevelt found ways to condemn and discard the Constitution and to redefine the Declaration to justify government without limit. As a result, both documents have been weakened, their influence diminished, and their meaning obscured—paving the way for the modern administrative state, unaccountable to the will of the people.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Founders’ Key&lt;/I&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a powerful call to rediscover the connection between these two mighty documents, and thereby restore our political faith and revive our free institutions.&lt;/P&gt;" />
