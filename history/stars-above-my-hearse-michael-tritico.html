  <title>Stars Above My Hearse - Michael Tritico</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the mid-1960s, Michael Tritico is growing tired of ultra-conservative Louisiana; he hears whispers of a new way of life out West. He ventures out of his comfort zone and heads to the mountains, trying to escape a swamp of depression.
He soon finds himself rejuvenated in many ways, fighting lifes boredom and the things that keep him down along his journey. Making it to California, hes joined by thousands of others who are seeking a different way of life and participating in what they call The Revolution.
During a span lasting just a handful of precious years, this is a time of love. For those that allow it to happen, almost anything negative can be overcome. But its not completely peaceful: Hippies, Hells Angels, Vietnam veterans, law enforcement personnel, politicians, and numerous silent minorities interact in complex ways.
Join Michael as he remembers a youth full of miracles and shares the harmony and struggles of the 1960s in &lt;i&gt;Stars above My Hearse.&lt;/i&gt;" />
