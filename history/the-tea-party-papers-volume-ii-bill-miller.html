  <title>The Tea Party Papers Volume Ii - Bill Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally buttressed with Natures bounty, fortified with Natures gifts, testifying to Natures truth we must be ready to take a leap in faith. The hardest leap of faith to believe in; is a leap of faith in each other, in the individual.  
In the end the only way a government of the Individuals, by the Individuals for the Individual can long endure on the face of the Earth. 
Faith in God alone cannot suffice for such a government to work. It is the most necessary prerequisite for such a government to exist. But it cannot retain it cannot nurture it because the government is a covenant a pact made between God and the individual. If we lose faith in the individual we break the sacred pact. 
Being granted so many gifts the last act is in our own hands we are the City on the Hill when we believe we are the City on the Hill. 
When we act the part we are the Light of the world and the Inspiration to the World.
It is really simple, if enough individuals carry out this leap of faith, a new critical mass will be reached, and a miracle will turn the tide in our affairs once more and we like the patriots of old will once again fulfill our own self-actualization process and bequeath to our posterity the ability and responsibility to reach their own." />
