  <title>Research in Medicine - Richard M. Pearce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The phrase &quot;Research in Medicine&quot; will naturally arouse different  thoughts and associations in the minds of different groups of men. The  bacteriologist will be reminded of Pasteur, Koch, Behring and Flexner  and the triumphs of bacteriology and serum-therapy; the surgeon, of  Lister and antisepsis, of anesthesia, and of the X-ray; the physician of  new means of cure and of diagnosis, of specific sera and vaccines, of  the electrocardiograph, the polygraph and other complicated instruments  of precision; and the average layman of a confused and confusing welter  of catchwords and slogans for popular agitations vaguely associated with  antitoxins, mosquitoes, good water supply, sewage disposal, lowered  infant mortality and the modern treatment of tuberculosis. But in the  last analysis the impressions of all would be of progress in a period  representing a little more than half of the past century. This period is  indeed the golden age of medical progress and one to which the  historian or philosopher must give his best attention if he is to  interpret, properly, the impulses which actuate medical research at the  present time...  The presentation of the subject of research in medicine  aims to demonstrate (1) that, wonderful as were the isolated  achievements of the great discoverers in medicine in the early  centuries, the great continuous advance in medicine during the past  eighty years resulted from organized laboratory effort based on the  principle of exact experimental methods, and (2) that it is the duty of  the university so to organize its laboratories and hospital that this  advance of medicine by research may continue, side by side with  teaching, as a university function of benefit to student and faculty, as  well as to the state and the general public welfare, and thus as an aid  to the advancement of civilization...&lt;/p&gt;
