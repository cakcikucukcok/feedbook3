  <title>Wah-to-yah, and the Taos Trail - Lewis Hector Garrard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wah-to-Yah is the only well-known book written by Garrard. It has won a secure place in the literature of the American&lt;br /&gt;
West.&lt;br /&gt;
On 1 Sept 1846, Garrard, 17 years old, joined a caravan in Westport Landing, Missouri to travel along the Santa Fe Trail to&lt;br /&gt;
New Mexico. He stopped off at Bent&amp;#39;s Fort for two months and continued on to Taos with a company of Mountain Men to avenge&lt;br /&gt;
the death of Charles Bent in the Taos Revolt. While in Taos, Garrard attended the trial of some of the Mexicans and Pueblos&lt;br /&gt;
who had revolted against U.S. rule of New Mexico, newly captured in the Mexican&amp;ndash;American War. Garrard wrote the only eye&lt;br /&gt;
witness account of the trial and hanging of six convicted men.&lt;br /&gt;
Garrard returned home after his 10-month trip and apparently never visited the West again.&lt;br /&gt;
The book is &amp;quot;fresh and vigorous&amp;quot; and contains in its pages authentic descriptions of &amp;quot;the Indian, the trader, the mountain&lt;br /&gt;
man, their dress, and behavior and speech and the country and climate they lived in.&amp;quot; The pages of the book contain a&lt;br /&gt;
wealth of characters, including Kit Carson, Jim Beckwourth, Ceran St. Vrain, George F. Ruxton, William Bent, and others and&lt;br /&gt;
an &amp;quot;anthropologically accurate&amp;quot; description of the Cheyenne Indians. &amp;nbsp;Garrard condemns the U.S. war against Mexico and&lt;br /&gt;
hanging of the rebels in Taos as unjust." />
