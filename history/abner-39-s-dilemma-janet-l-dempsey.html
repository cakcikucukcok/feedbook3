  <title>Abner&#39;s Dilemma - Janet L. Dempsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With the comforts of their Bavarian homes far behind them, ten year-old Abner and his friends are among the Brethren refugees challenged once again to trust God.  They must wait on the  eastern banks of the Susquehanna River until Thomas Penn signs a treaty with the Susquehannock Indians.  This treaty will allow them to safely go forward to their promised lands in York County, Pennsylvania.
     Daily Abner&#39;s family and friends anticipate the signal to move on, yet almost a year passes. As they continue to hold on to their dreams, Abner&#39;s father struggles to provide for his family, and Abner learns the value of hard work. Widow Schneider continues to harass Abner with her mean ways while Abner learns the value of forgiveness and keeping his mouth shut.  Fear of poverty, sickness, war, Indians, and the possible cruelty of bound servitude hound them as they wait.
     The joys and sorrows of life and death flow one day after another as lives are challenged with the blessings and struggles of surviving in the New World.  The Proverb, &quot;He who does not work does not eat,&quot; applies to life in this land of opportunity. The land is beautiful but demanding, and all sojourners are expected to give their all when faced with the pressures of this new life. Yet, hope and dreams fill their hearts for their future since they are believing that God will never leave nor forsake them." />
