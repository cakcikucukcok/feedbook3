  <title>Jubal Early - Benjamin Franklin Cooling Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Jubal Early: Robert E. Lee&amp;rsquo;s Bad Old Man, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;a new critical biography of Confederate Lieutenant General Jubal Anderson Early, Civil War historian B.F. Cooling III takes a fresh look at one of the most fascinating, idiosyncratic characters in the pantheon of Confederate heroes and villains. Dubbed by Robert E. Lee as his &amp;quot;bad old man&amp;quot; because of his demeanor, Early was also Lee&amp;#39;s chosen instrument to attack and capture Washington as well as defend the Shenandoah Valley granary in the summer and fall of 1864. Neither cornered nor snared by Union opponents, Early came closest of any Confederate general to capturing Washington, ending Lincoln&amp;#39;s presidency, and forever changing the fate of the Civil War and American history. His failure to grapple with this moment of historical immortality and emerge victorious bespeaks as much his own foibles as the counter-efforts of the enemy, the effects of weather and the shortcomings of his army. From the pinnacle of success, Jubal Early descended to the trough of defeat within three months when opponent General Philip Sheridan resoundingly defeated him in the Valley campaign of 1864. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Jubal Early: Robert E. Lee&amp;rsquo;s Bad Old Man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; will appeal to anyone interested in Civil War history and Confederate history more generally.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
