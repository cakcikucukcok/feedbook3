  <title>Life and Adventures of Lewis Wetzel - The Virginia Ranger - With Biographical Sketches of Other Heroes of the American Frontier - Illustrated - Cecil B. Hartley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The Death Wind.&quot; This was the name Indians applied to Lewis Wetzel for whenever he made a kill, he would throw his head back and let go with an un-godly scream that would echo through the hills of the Ohio frontier. The Indians upon hearing this sound knew that one of their own had just been met his end. Lewis Wetzel, undoubtedly the best woodsman / warrior that ever lived, was responsible for the death of over 100 Indians. It mattered not to him that they were Chiefs, Warriors, women or children. He could care less if they were peaceful, allies or enemies. Only that they were Indians. Wetzel did everything in his power to prevent any peaceful settlement between Whites and Indians from taking place. He did not want peace until the last Indian was dead. History has portrayed Wetzel as both a hero and a villain.
   This book also contains biographical sketches of other famous frontier names such as Simon Kenton, Benjamin Logan, Samuel Brady and many others." />
