  <title>Japanese Blitz On Darwin - John Thompson-Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New evidence explains Australia&#39;s most infamous day.  The Imperial Japanese Navy bombers that attacked Pearl Harbour on December 7th 1941 blitzed Darwin on February 19th 1942.    As Australia defended her mainland for the first time the only Ally standing with her was the United States of America.  On that day, Americans and Australians were forged as Cousins-in-Arms.     Darwin&#39;s airfield, town and harbour were repeatedly bombed leaving a trail of human tragedy. Typical of the many heroes were Wing Commander Archie Tindal RAAF Base, Lieutenant Robert Oestreicher Kittyhawk Ace, Jack Mullholland Anti-Aircraft Gunner, Matron Clara Schumack hospital ship and Coxswain John Waldie life-saver.   The writer weaves historical facts into story lines with real time action sequences.  Where the story varies from historic opinion, forensic reasons are revealed for differing views, and the reader&#39;s judgement is invited.  Examples are the role of spies, withholding the air raid warning, attacked hospitals, interpretation of information and subtleties of the Japanese attack plan.    Action-thriller Japanese Blitz on Darwin, by Cambridge Short Story scholar John Thompson-Gray is a story of the first Darwin Defenders and those who bombed and strafed them." />
