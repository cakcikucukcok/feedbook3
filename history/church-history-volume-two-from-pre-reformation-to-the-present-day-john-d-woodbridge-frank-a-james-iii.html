  <title>Church History, Volume Two: From Pre-Reformation to the Present Day - John  D. Woodbridge, Frank A. James Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Church history is the story of the greatest community the world has known and the greatest movement in world history. Yet, just as the biblical record of the people of God is the story of a mixed people with great acts of faith and great failures in sin and unfaithfulness, so is the history of the people who have made up the church down through the ages.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Church History, Volume Two&lt;/EM&gt; is an account of the ups and downs, the triumphs and struggles, of the Christian movement. It offers a unique contextual view of how the Christian church spread and developed from the just prior to the Reformation and through the next five-hundred-plus years into the present-day. This book looks closely at the integral link between the history of the world and that of the church, detailing the times, cultures, and events that both influenced and were influenced by the church.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Filled with maps, charts, and illustrations, gives primary attention to the history of Christianity in the West (western Europe and North America), but given the global and ecumenical environment of the twenty-first century, it also covers Africa, eastern Europe, Asia, and Latin America.&lt;/P&gt;" />
