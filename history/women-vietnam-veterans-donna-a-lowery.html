  <title>Women Vietnam Veterans - Donna A. Lowery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Women Vietnam Veterans: Our Untold Stories, by Donna Lowery, a Vietnam veteran, chronicles the participation of American military women during the Vietnam War. This little-known group of an estimated 1,000 women from the Army, Marine Corps, Navy and Air Force left its mark in Vietnam from 1962 to 1973. They served in a myriad of duties from intelligence analysts, flight controllers, clerk-typists, translators, physical therapists, dietitians and communications specialists among many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our Untold Stories allows the women to speak for themselves about their experiences, and, for the first time ever, brings names, facts and figures together in one literary work. The purpose of the book is to be historically significant to future researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The history of the military women in Vietnam began in 1962 with Army Major Anne Marie Doering. She was born in what became North Vietnam. Her father was a French officer, her mother a German citizen. When her father died, her mother married an American businessman. Her service in Vietnam as a Combat Intelligence Officer is a compelling story of the US military women in a war zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not until 1965 that the US Womens Army Corps (WAC) sent two women as advisors to assist the newly formed Vietnam Womens Armed Forces Corps. The following year, the Army authorized the establishment of a WAC Detachment in Vietnam. Soon, thereafter, the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy also sent women to serve in various capacities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 1973, under the Paris Peace Accords, the last women left Vietnam along with the remaining men. The impact they had in Vietnam set the stage for the expansion and integration of women into additional roles in the military. Today, women serve in areas of active combat, demonstrating their abilities and dedication to the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
