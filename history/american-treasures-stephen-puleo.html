  <title>American Treasures - Stephen Puleo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen Puleo&#39;s American Treasures is a narrative history of  America&#39;s secret efforts to hide its founding documents  from Axis  powers, and its national tradition of uniting to defend the definition  of democracy.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt; Bestseller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On December 26, 1941, Secret Service Agent Harry E. Neal stood on a platform at Washington&#39;s Union Station, watching a train chug off into the dark and feeling at once relieved and inexorably anxious. These were dire times: as Hitler&#39;s armies plowed across Europe, seizing or destroying the Continent&#39;s historic artifacts at will, Japan bristled to the East. The Axis was rapidly closing in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So FDR set about hiding the country&#39;s valuables. On the train speeding away from Neal sat four plain-wrapped cases containing the documentary history of American democracy: the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Gettysburg Address, and more, guarded by a battery of agents and bound for safekeeping in the nation&#39;s most impenetrable hiding place.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;American Treasures&lt;/i&gt; charts the little-known journeys of these American crown jewels. From the risky and audacious adoption of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 to our modern Fourth of July celebrations, &lt;i&gt;American Treasures &lt;/i&gt;shows how the ideas captured in these documents underscore the nation&#39;s strengths and hopes, and embody its fundamental values of liberty and equality. Stephen Puleo weaves in exciting stories of freedom under fire - from the Declaration and Constitution smuggled out of Washington days before the British burned the capital in 1814, to their covert relocation during WWII - crafting a sweeping history of a nation united to preserve its definition of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
