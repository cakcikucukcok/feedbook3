  <title>Rot, Riot, and Rebellion: Mr. Jefferson&#39;s Struggle to Save the University That Changed America - Rex Bowman, Carlos Santos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Jefferson had a radical dream for higher education. Designed to     become the first modern public university, the University of Virginia was envisioned as a     liberal campus with no religious affiliation, with elective courses and student self-government.     Nearly two centuries after the university&#39;s creation, its success now seems     preordained-its founder, after all, was a great American genius. Yet what many don&#39;t know     is that Jefferson&#39;s university almost failed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Rot, Riot,     and Rebellion,&lt;/i&gt; award-winning journalists Rex Bowman and Carlos Santos offer a dramatic     re-creation of the university&#39;s early struggles. Political enemies, powerful religious     leaders, and fundamentalist Christians fought Jefferson and worked to thwart his dream. Rich     students, many from southern plantations, held a sense of honor and entitlement that compelled     them to resist even minor rules and regulations. They fought professors, townsfolk, and each     other with guns, knives, and fists. In response, professors armed themselves-often with good     reason: one was horsewhipped, others were attacked in their classrooms, and one was twice the     target of a bomb. The university was often broke, and Jefferson&#39;s enemies, crouched and     ready to pounce, looked constantly for reasons to close its doors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yet from     its tumultuous, early days, Jefferson&#39;s university-a cauldron of unrest and educational     daring-blossomed into the first real American university. Here, Bowman and Santos bring us into     the life of the University of Virginia at its founding to reveal how this once shaky institution     grew into a novel, American-style university on which myriad other U.S. universities were     modeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
