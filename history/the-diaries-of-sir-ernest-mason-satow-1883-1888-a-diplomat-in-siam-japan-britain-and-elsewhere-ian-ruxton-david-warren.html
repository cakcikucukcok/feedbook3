  <title>The Diaries of Sir Ernest Mason Satow, 1883-1888: A Diplomat In Siam, Japan, Britain and Elsewhere - Ian Ruxton, David Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These are the edited (i.e. transcribed, annotated and indexed) diaries of Sir Ernest Satow (1843-1929) for the six years from the time when he left Japan early in 1883, through his time as Agent and Consul-General and subsequent promotion to Minister Resident at Bangkok, until his return to London and his request in December 1887 for another posting on health grounds. The period includes his visits to Japan (officially for rest and recuperation) in 1884 and 1886, and to Rome and Lisbon for research into the Jesuits in Japan conducted early in 1888, and the confirmation of his appointment to Montevideo in October of that year. Throughout the period his ultimate goal was promotion to Minister in Japan, which he achieved in 1895. The original diaries are in the National Archives (UK). Published for the first time on lulu.com." />
