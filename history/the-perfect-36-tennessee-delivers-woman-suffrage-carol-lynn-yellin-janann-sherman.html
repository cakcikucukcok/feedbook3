  <title>The Perfect 36: Tennessee Delivers Woman Suffrage - Carol Lynn Yellin, Janann Sherman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The authors bring to life the 72-year suffrage to earn women the right to vote which culminated with the final vote needed for ratification in the Tennessee legislature. &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Perfect 36&lt;/em&gt; gives voice to those who were for and against the right of women to vote with a richly illustrated volume. The authors provide a great deal of writings of those who were involved in this important movement along with pictures and cartoons to give a vivid sense of what it was like to win enfranchisement. &lt;em&gt;The Perfect 36&lt;/em&gt; is an important resource for anyone interested in how women and men earned the right for women to fully participate in the democratic process of the United States. With the national centennial approaching in 2020, the importance of learning about this nonviolent revolution cannot be overstated. The suffragists proved democracy works. This book contains interviews that no other book about woman suffrage has. It is the complete history of what happened in Tennessee to secure ratification.&lt;/p&gt;" />
