  <title>Mango Rain - Berta Isabel Arias</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in Cuba and Chicago, &lt;em&gt;Mango Rain &lt;/em&gt;is a flawlessly told story of intrigue, love, separation and hope.&amp;nbsp; It is a family story.&amp;nbsp; The author&amp;rsquo;s descriptions of the luscious,&amp;nbsp;tropical island are delicious. Readers will savor the flavor of the Cuba so few people know. Dr. Arias&amp;rsquo; personal history and knowledge provide her with a unique perspective into the minds, hearts, fears and aspirations of a people living in a closed society contrasted with Cubans living the American dream.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Readers will experience the ethos of Cubans and Cuban Americans. Authentically shared, it unfolds through the eyes of Ana&amp;iacute;s, a successful Cuban-American businesswoman who was adopted by a non-Latino family at a very young age at the start of the Cuban Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Now 38 years old, emerging from the emotional reverberations of a tragic car accident that took the lives of her husband and her adoptive parents, Ana&amp;iacute;s is selected to join a month-long diplomatic trade mission to the country of her birth, where her multi-language skills will be key to the success of the mission.&amp;nbsp; Chicago is her home, yet she knows she had another home, Cuba. Though too young to remember anything about her birth family or where she was born, she shares with long-time friend and colleague, Richard that she&amp;rsquo;s both excited and a little afraid of what she may or may not find when she arrives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Her diplomatic journey from Chicago to Havana, intertwined with her curiosity about who she really is, and her love of beauty, nature and people, set her on a remarkable adventure of surprising self-discovery.&amp;nbsp; Learning about the circumstances of her adoption, the revelation of family members still in Cuba and the overwhelming guilt of having lived a comfortable life in Chicago while those in Cuba did without so much, ultimately puts her in grave danger.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Readers will revel in Ana&amp;iacute;s&amp;rsquo; journey to Havana and beyond into the lessor known areas of Cuba, savoring the food, music and traditions of the hidden Cuba. The eye-opening revelation of what loving parents will do to save their children is heart-rending.&amp;nbsp; Equally touching is the joyful and hopeful nature of a people who have lived in a repressive society singing, dancing and savoring the moment. Follow Ana&amp;iacute;s as she navigates a geopolitical minefield to achieve what her birth parents desired.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Whether you are one of the more than two million Cuban Americans living in the US, or one of the tens of millions who love a good story with a special interest in an unusual setting, you will fall in love with the setting, the story and the wonderful characters in &lt;em&gt;Mango Rain &lt;/em&gt;and thirst for more.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Mango Rain &lt;/em&gt;is available in both English and Spanish versions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
