Two kids are gathering corn on their family&amp;#39;s 500 acre ranch. Suddenly, several shots ring out! They crawl to where they heard the shots come from and find a campsite with five dead men. After checking closer, they discover one of the men, an American, is still alive, but barely!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born and raised in Boston in the middle of the Nineteenth Century, Will Austin leads a life of adventure and passion. He survives the death of both his parents at a very young age, and the cold blooded killing of his best friend, Boyd.
