  <title>A Global History of Sexual Science, 1880–1960 - Veronika Fuechtner, Douglas E. Haynes, Ryan M. Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sex is central to the history of humankind. Yet it was during the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries that people all over the world began to insist that understandings of sex must be based on science. As Japanese and Indian sexologists influenced German and Americans and vice versa, these global conversations became crucial for understanding how sexuality and modernity became intimately linked. The first anthology to provide a global perspective on the birth and development of the field,&amp;#160;&lt;I&gt;Global History of Sexual Science&amp;#160;&lt;/I&gt;contends that European sexual science was established on the basis that actors outside of Europe&amp;mdash;in Asia, Latin America, and Africa&amp;mdash;became important interlocutors in a globalizing field where emergent ideas were circulated through intellectual exchange, travel, and internationally produced and disseminated publications. Twenty scholars tackle specific issues, such as prostitution or the criminalization of male homosexuality, to demonstrate how concepts and ideas introduced by sexual scientists gained currency around the modern world." />
