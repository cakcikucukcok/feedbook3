  <title>The Court of the Last Tsar: Pomp, Power and Pageantry in the Reign of Nicholas II - Greg King</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Praise for The Court of the Last Tsar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Any book by Greg King is a book to be kept and savored. He has not only given us a fresh, clear-eyed, and often startling new look at the life of the last Romanovs, but also lived up to the promise of his title. He has shown us how the whole enterprise worked, from Tsar Nicholas to his lowest cook and chambermaid. This book is a great work of scholarship--and a wonderful read.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Peter Kurth, author of Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra and Anastasia: The Riddle of Anna Anderson&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A mammoth, monumental achievement. No other book captures the essence and the entire scope of life at the court of Nicholas II. It&#39;s a thoroughly enjoyable and encyclopedic masterpiece that will be a major source for historians and biographers for years to come.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Marlene A. Eilers, author of Queen Victoria&#39;s Descendants and publisher of Royal Book News&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Greg King has truly written a tour de force. The book is extremely well researched, has over 100 illustrations and is, quite simply, marvelous.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Coryne Hall, author of Little Mother of Russia, Once a Grand Duchess, and Imperial Dancer&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Greg King is emerging as one of the leading authorities in today&#39;s liveliest field of Russian studies, and this is a major contribution to the study of late Imperial Russia.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Joseph T. Fuhrmann, author of Rasputin and the editor of The Complete Wartime Correspondence of Tsar Nicholas II and the Empress Alexandra" />
