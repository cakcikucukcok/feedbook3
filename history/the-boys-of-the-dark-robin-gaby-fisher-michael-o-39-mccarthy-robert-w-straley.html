  <title>The Boys of the Dark - Robin Gaby Fisher, Michael O&#39;McCarthy, Robert W. Straley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A story that garnered national attention, this is the harrowing tale of two men who suffered abuses at a reform school in Florida in the 1950s and 60s, and who banded together fifty years later to confront their attackers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael O&#39;McCarthy and Robert W. Straley were teens when they were termed &quot;incorrigible youth&quot; by authorities and ordered to attend the Florida School for Boys. They discovered in Marianna, the &quot;City of Southern Charm,&quot; an immaculately groomed campus that looked more like an idyllic university than a reform school. But hidden behind the gates of the Florida School for Boys was a hell unlike any they could have imagined. The school&#39;s guards and administrators acted as their jailers and tormentors. The boys allegedly bore witness to assault, rape, and possibly even murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For fifty years, both men---and countless others like them---carried their torment in silence. But a series of unlikely events brought O&#39;McCarthy, now a successful rights activist, and Straley together, and they became determined to expose the Florida School for Boys for what they believed it to be: a youth prison with a century-long history of abuse. They embarked upon a campaign that would change their lives and inspire others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robin Gaby Fisher, a Pulitzer Prize--winning journalist and author of the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling &lt;i&gt;After the Fire&lt;/i&gt;, collaborates with Straley and O&#39;McCarthy to offer a riveting account of their harrowing ordeal. The book goes beyond the story of the two men to expose the truth about a century-old institution and a town that adopted a Nuremberg-like code of secrecy and a government that failed to address its own wrongdoing. What emerges is a tale of strength, resolve, and vindication in the face of the kinds of terror few can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
