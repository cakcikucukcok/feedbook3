  <title>Operation Chaos - Matthew Sweet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An untold Cold War story: how the CIA tried to infiltrate a radical group of U.S. military deserters, a tale that leads from a bizarre political cult to the heart of the Washington establishment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stockholm, 1968. A thousand American deserters and draft-resisters are arriving to escape the war in Vietnam. They&#39;re young, they&#39;re radical, and they want to start a revolution. Some of them even want to take the fight to America. The Swedes treat them like pop stars--but the CIA is determined to stop all that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a job for the deep-cover men of Operation Chaos and their allies--agents who know how to infiltrate organizations and destroy them from inside. Within months, the GIs have turned their fire on one another. Then the interrogations begin--to discover who among them has been brainwashed, Manchurian Candidate-style, to assassinate their leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Matthew Sweet began investigating this story, he thought the madness was over. He was wrong. Instead, he became the confidant of an eccentric and traumatized group of survivors--each with his own theory about the traitors in their midst. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All Sweet has to do is find out the truth. And stay sane. Which may be difficult when one of his interviewees accuses him of being a CIA agent and another suspects that he&#39;s part of a secret plot by the British royal family to start World War III. By that time, he&#39;s deep in the labyrinth of truths and half-truths, wondering where reality ends and delusion begins.&lt;/p&gt;" />
