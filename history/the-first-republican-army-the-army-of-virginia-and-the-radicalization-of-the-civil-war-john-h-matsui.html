  <title>The First Republican Army: The Army of Virginia and the Radicalization of the Civil War - John H. Matsui</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although much is known about the political stance of the military at     large during the Civil War, the political party affiliations of individual soldiers have     received little attention. Drawing on archival sources from twenty-five generals and 250     volunteer officers and enlisted men, John Matsui offers the first major study to examine the     ways in which individual politics were as important as military considerations to battlefield     outcomes and how the experience of war could alter soldiers&#39; political     views.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conservative war aims pursued by Abraham Lincoln&#39;s generals     (and to some extent, the president himself) in the first year of the American Civil War focused     on the preservation of the Union and the restoration of the antebellum status quo. This approach     was particularly evident in the prevailing policies and attitudes toward Confederacy-supporting     Southern civilians and slavery. But this changed in Virginia during the summer of 1862 with the     formation of the Army of Virginia. If the Army of the Potomac (the major Union force in     Virginia) was dominated by generals who concurred with the ideology of the Democratic Party, the     Army of Virginia (though likewise a Union force) was its political opposite, from its senior     generals to the common soldiers. The majority of officers and soldiers in the Army of Virginia     saw slavery and pro-Confederate civilians as crucial components of the rebel war effort and     blamed them for prolonging the war. The frustrating occupation experiences of the Army of     Virginia radicalized them further, making them a vanguard against Southern rebellion and slavery     within the Union army as a whole and paving the way for Abraham Lincoln to issue the     Emancipation Proclamation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
