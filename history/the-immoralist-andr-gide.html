  <title>The Immoralist - André Gide</title>
      <meta name="description" content="André Paul Guillaume Gide (French: [??d?e p?l ?ijom ?id]; 22 November 1869 - 19 February 1951) was a French author and winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1947 &quot;for his comprehensive and artistically significant writings, in which human problems and conditions have been presented with a fearless love of truth and keen psychological insight&quot;.[1] Gide&#39;s career ranged from its beginnings in the symbolist movement, to the advent of anticolonialism between the two World Wars.  Known for his fiction as well as his autobiographical works, Gide exposes to public view the conflict and eventual reconciliation of the two sides of his personality, split apart by a straitlaced education and a narrow social moralism. Gide&#39;s work can be seen as an investigation of freedom and empowerment in the face of moralistic and puritanical constraints, and centres on his continuous effort to achieve intellectual honesty." />
