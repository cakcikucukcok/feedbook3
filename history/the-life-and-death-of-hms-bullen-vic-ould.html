  <title>The Life and Death of HMS Bullen - Vic Ould</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A warship built in the U.S.A. under &#39;Lease Lend&#39; for the Royal Navy she was classed as a &#39;Destroyer Escort&#39; and re-classed in the Royal Navy as a &#39;Frigate&#39;. As with many warships in WW2 she was &#39;manned&#39; with Men and Boys many of whom together with the ship lasted less than 12 months. The &#39;Boys&#39; became &#39;Men&#39; in that short time and many were wounded and died for freedom and their country. As in the previous book by the author &#39;Last But Not Least&#39; which was about a &#39;sister&#39; ship these are personal memories of some survivors with illustrations and photographs from the author&#39;s collection. The author a Battle of the Atlantic veteran was 18 years old at that time, serving on HMS CARRON a destroyer protecting special convoys. He retains his connection with the Royal Navy by being a volunteer working on the historic warship HMS BELFAST at London Bridge and he has also volunteered on HMS CAVALIER at the Historic Dockyard, Chatham, Kent." />
