  <title>She Was One of Us - Brigid O&#39;Farrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Although born to a life of privilege and married to the President of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt was a staunch and lifelong advocate for workers and, for more than twenty-five years, a proud member of the AFL-CIO&#39;s Newspaper Guild. &lt;em&gt;She Was One of Us&lt;/em&gt; tells for the first time the story of her deep and lasting ties to the American labor movement. Brigid O&#39;Farrell follows Roosevelt-one of the most admired and, in her time, controversial women in the world-from the tenements of New York City to the White House, from local union halls to the convention floor of the AFL-CIO, from coal mines to political rallies to the United Nations. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Roosevelt worked with activists around the world to develop a shared vision of labor rights as human rights, which are central to democracy. In her view, everyone had the right to a decent job, fair working conditions, a living wage, and a voice at work. &lt;em&gt;She Was One of Us&lt;/em&gt; provides a fresh and compelling account of her activities on behalf of workers, her guiding principles, her circle of friends-including Rose Schneiderman of the Women&#39;s Trade Union League and the garment unions and Walter Reuther, &quot;the most dangerous man in Detroit&quot;-and her adversaries, such as the influential journalist Westbrook Pegler, who attacked her as a dilettante and her labor allies as &quot;thugs and extortioners.&quot; As O&#39;Farrell makes clear, Roosevelt was not afraid to take on opponents of workers&#39; rights or to criticize labor leaders if they abused their power; she never wavered in her support for the rank and file. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Today, union membership has declined to levels not seen since the Great Depression, and the silencing of American workers has contributed to rising inequality. In &lt;em&gt;She Was One of Us&lt;/em&gt;, Eleanor Roosevelt&#39;s voice can once again be heard by those still working for social justice and human rights.&lt;/p&gt;" />
