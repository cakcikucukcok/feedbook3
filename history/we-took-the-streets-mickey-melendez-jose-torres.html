  <title>We Took the Streets - Mickey Melendez, Jose Torres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An inside look at the Young Lords, the radical Puerto Rican activist group of the 1960s, from one of its founding members.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1968 Miguel &quot;Mickey&quot; Melendez was a college student, developing pride in his unique cultural identity as Cuban and Puerto Rican, while growing increasingly aware of the lack of quality health care, education, and housing--not to mention respect--his people endured for the sake of the American Dream.  He was not alone. Bringing together other like-minded Latino student activists, like Juan Gonzalez, Felipe Luciano, David Perez, and Pablo &quot;Yoruba&quot; Guzman, Melendez helped to form the central committee of what would become the New York branch of the Young Lords. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next three years, the Young Lords were a force to be reckoned with. From their storefront offices in East Harlem, they defiantly took back the streets of El Barrio.  In addition to running clothing drives, day-care centers, and free breakfast and health programs, the Young Lords became known for their bold radical actions, like the takeovers of the First People&#39;s Church and Lincoln Hospital.  Front-page news, they forced the city to take notice of their demands for social and political justice and make drastic policy changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Melendez was part of it all, and describes the idealism, anger, and vitality of the Lords with the unsparing eye of an insider.  For the first time, he reveals the extent of the clandestine military branch of the organization and his role coordinating and arming the underground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although they were active for only a brief period of time, the legacy of the Young Lords--their urban guerrilla, media-savvy tactics, as well as their message of popular power and liberation, civil rights, and ethnic equity--is lasting.  &lt;i&gt;We Took the Streets&lt;/i&gt; is one man&#39;s passionate and inspiring story of the Puerto Rican struggle for equality, civil rights, and independence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
