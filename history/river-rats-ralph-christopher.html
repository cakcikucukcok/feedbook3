  <title>River Rats - Ralph Christopher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The United States Navys fight for control of the waters of Southeast Asia.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By far the greatest contribution of the narrative is the insight it provides into the hows and whys of United States involvement in Vietnam, and the attempt of that involvement to bring freedom to those who were unable to achieve it by their own efforts. We see the United States more as a caretaker and less as a policeman in terms of motivation for its involvement half a world away. Andwe see the tremendous price paid by those who served to ensure that freedom  ordinary men who, by fate, were thrown together in a strange land, and who fulfilled a part of their destiny, and their Nations, on the brown water.&lt;/p&gt;
