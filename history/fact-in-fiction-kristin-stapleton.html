  <title>Fact in Fiction - Kristin Stapleton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Historical novels can be windows into other cultures and eras, but it&#39;s not always clear what&#39;s fact and what&#39;s fiction. Thousands have read Ba Jin&#39;s influential novel &lt;i&gt;Family&lt;/i&gt;, but few realize how much he shaped his depiction of 1920s China to suit his story and his politics. In &lt;i&gt;Fact in Fiction&lt;/i&gt;, Kristin Stapleton puts Ba Jin&#39;s bestseller into full historical context, both to illustrate how it successfully portrays human experiences during the 1920s and to reveal its historical distortions.
Stapleton&#39;s attention to historical evidence and clear prose that directly addresses themes and characters from &lt;i&gt;Family&lt;/i&gt; create a book that scholars, students, and general readers will enjoy. She focuses on Chengdu, China, Ba Jin&#39;s birthplace and the setting for &lt;i&gt;Family&lt;/i&gt;, which was also a cultural and political center of western China. The city&#39;s richly preserved archives allow Stapleton to create an intimate portrait of a city that seemed far from the center of national politics of the day but clearly felt the forces of—and contributed to—the turbulent stream of Chinese history." />
