  <title>Merritt Magic - Melinda Merritt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the world we lived in which was one of dreams, spirituality, magic, and love.  I arrived just at the end of the Pisces Age in 1950, and I could feel the energies changing early in my life. The Sages had spoken to the families about the coming cultural change which would take the world by storm.  We had no idea what they meant, but we knew it would happen. I was just going about my life learning all the ancient African knowledge and wisdom my family taught.  After all, this is the spirituality and ancestral knowledge which freed the slaves from bondage.  We were a very blessed family in that there was never any lack, just a life of abundance.  The Sages controlled what happened in this world and no one ever questioned them.  Our world was filled with happiness, excitement, and surprise.
Then, as though my world was not already filled with many unusual things, in the early 1960&#39;s, it happened.  The change of which the Sages had been speaking, started to happen.  Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Civil Rights Movement came to our little town of Americus, GA.  This was the very beginning of what turned out to be the biggest event, ever.  My father was a successful independent business leader and he and Rev. King (as  Dr. King was known at that time) bonded immediately.  This meant that our entire family was heavily involved in the &quot;Movement&quot;.  Dr. King was frequently at our home and became a part of the family for many years. 
Everything changed for me and the family when this Movement came but the Sages managed to keep control over our daily lives.  These were some powerful Black women whom no one dared cross. The  energy which drove the Movement was constantly pointed out to me by the Sages.  I became an expert on the human energy phenomenon.  The world was completely magical and it seemed to have come to our small town. The people we met were from all over the globe.  The power of the black people&#39;s energy was working full force. 
Because of what the Sages taught me, I was able to travel through my entire life in control of my &quot;elements&quot;.  The Sages believed, practiced, and taught that if you can control your elements, you can control your life.
This book is about these Black powerful women who had taken their gifts and skills underground, until now." />
