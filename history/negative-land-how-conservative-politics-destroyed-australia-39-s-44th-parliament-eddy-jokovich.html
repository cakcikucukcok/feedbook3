  <title>Negative land: How conservative politics destroyed Australia&#39;s 44th Parliament - Eddy Jokovich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The election of the Liberal&amp;ndash;National Party in 2013 was meant to put an end to division within Australian politics, after three years of painstaking internal leadership warfare in the Labor Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But nobody told Tony Abbott. He assumed, quite wrongly, the electorate voted him in to pursue his conservative ideological projects, rather than restore stability to the political system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We start in the week before the 2013 election and travel through the bizarre nature of Tony Abbott&amp;rsquo;s prime ministership, and how he couldn&amp;rsquo;t make the transition from combative Leader of the Opposition and rise above petty ideological squabbles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His replacement, Malcolm Turnbull, offered hope to the electorate but ended up languishing in a position as poor as his predecessor&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We end with the 2016 election campaign, and its lingering aftermath, and ponder how conservative politicians and their supporters in the media have taken Australian politics to a point where the electorate is wondering whether our political leaders have the skills or the desire to lead Australia through difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
