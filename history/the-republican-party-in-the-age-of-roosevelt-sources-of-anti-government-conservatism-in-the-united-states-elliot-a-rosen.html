  <title>The Republican Party in the Age of Roosevelt: Sources of Anti-Government Conservatism in the United States - Elliot A. Rosen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elliot Rosen&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Hoover, Roosevelt, and the Brains Trust&lt;/i&gt;     focused on the transition from the Hoover administration to that of Roosevelt and the     formulation of the early New Deal program. &lt;i&gt;Roosevelt, the Great Depression, and the     Economics of Recovery &lt;/i&gt;emphasized long-term and structural recovery programs as well as     the 1937-38 recession. Rosen&#39;s final book in the trilogy, &lt;i&gt;The Republican Party in     the Age of Roosevelt,&lt;/i&gt; situates distrust of the federal government and the consequent     transformation of the party. Domestic and foreign policies introduced by the Roosevelt     administration created division between the parties. The Hoover doctrine, which sought to     restrict the reach of independent agencies at the federal level in order to restore business     confidence and investment, intended to reverse the New Deal and to curb the growth of federal     functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his new book, Elliot Rosen holds that economic thought     regarding appropriate functions of the federal government has not changed since the Great     Depression. The political debate is still being waged between advocates for direct intervention     at the federal level and those for the Hoover ethic with its stress on individual     responsibility. The question remains whether preservation of an unfettered marketplace and our     liberties remain inseparable or whether enlarged governmental functions are required in an     increasingly complex national and global environment. By offering a well-researched account of     the antistatist and nationalist origins not only of the debate over legitimate federal functions     but also of the modern Republican Party, this book affords insight into such contemporary     political movements as the Tea Party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
