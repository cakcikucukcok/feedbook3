By the time World War I began in 1914, Germany was well prepared for its conflict with France. Using the same tactics they employed to defeat France in the Franco-Prussian War, the Germans had established a bureau for espionage and another for propaganda. It was difficult to separate the spy from the propagandist. Both had the same purposeto defeat the enemy. &lt;p&gt;
Paul Marie Bolo was neither. He was a profiteer. A Frenchmen of limited means and morality, but with great ambition, Bolo sought to enrich himself by playing a major behind-the-scenes role in Germanys insatiable quest for power through propaganda." />
