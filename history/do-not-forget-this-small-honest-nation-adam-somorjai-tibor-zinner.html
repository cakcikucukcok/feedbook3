  <title>Do Not Forget This Small Honest Nation - Adam Somorjai, Tibor Zinner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Cardinal Joseph Mindszenty (18921975) was in 195671 &quot;guest&quot; of the American Embassy in Budapest, Hungary. During these 15 years he wrote a great number
    of letters and messages transmitted through diplomatic channels to four US Presidents and their Secretaries of State. There are only two Presidential
    answers: from Kennedy and from Nixon. In general, the Department of State instructed the Charg in Budapest to inform the Cardinal orally: his message has
    been received in the White House/State Department. This correspondence in his integrity remained buried in 5 archives.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    This book is offered for all those willing to learn the various problems of Cold War and detente periode, American diplomacy and the thinking of the great
    cardinal, in his generation hero of freedom for the Hungarians and for the World.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    From the letters of the Cardinal:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The Treaty of Versailles-&quot;Trianon has dismembered us, and Yalta has created a Soviet satellite out of us.&quot; (October 23, 1957)
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &quot;The moral qualifications leave the sinful-livers and blood-wallowers cold.&quot; (November 8, 1957)
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &quot;Today nothing is more important (and perhaps it is not too late) for mankind, than that its leaders and the led should learn what bolshevism is in the way
    that we its poor, wretched satellites have experienced in body and soul. This great lesson can equal the Declaration of Independence in its effect.&quot; (June
    23, 1960)
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &quot;This peace [i.e., the peace of Central Europe] has been the peace of the graveyard; only those who are not imprisoned can be satisfied with a jail.&quot;
    (August 10, 1961)
    &lt;br/&gt;
    &quot; illegality never can become legality, as the injustice justice.&quot; (March 13, 1964)
&lt;/p&gt;
