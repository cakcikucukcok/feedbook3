  <title>The Catholic Church and Power Politics in Latin America: The Dominican Case in Comparative Perspective - Emelio Betances</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Catholic Church acted as a mediator during social and political change in several Latin American countries from the 1960s through the 1990s: the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. Although the Catholic clergy was called to mediate in political crises in all five countries, in the Dominican Republic the Church&#39;s role as mediator was eventually institutionalized. A historical examination of church-state relations and case study of the Dominican Republic leads into important regional comparisons that broaden our understanding of the Catholic Church in the whole of Latin America." />
