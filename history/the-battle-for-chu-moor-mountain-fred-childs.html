  <title>The Battle for Chu Moor Mountain - Fred Childs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In April of 1968 in Kontum Province near the Cambodian border, the 1-22 Infantry fought a vicious battle with elements of the North Vietnamese Army. This became known as the Battle for Chu Moor Mountain. The combat was intense with the First Battalion attacking, the NVA counterattacking, and the First Battalion attacking again. The NVA employed mortars, B-40 rockets, snipers, and even flame throwers. Elements of the 1-14 Infantry, 1-12 Infantry, and 3-8 Infantry joined the battle when it became clear that the enemy was in force and had decided to stay. After nearly seven days of heavy fighting, the NVA finally withdrew, leaving the mountain in US hands. 
This is a compilation of firsthand stories from the brave troops of the Fourth Infantry Division who participated in that battle." />
