  <title>A Proper Person to be Detained - Catherine Czerkawska</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The story of a murder and its aftermath.&lt;/b&gt; On Christmas Night in 1881, John Manley, a poor son of Irish immigrants living in the slums of Leeds, was fatally stabbed in a drunken quarrel. The frightened murderer went on the run, knowing that capture could see him hang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A few generations later, author Catherine Czerkawska begins to tease out the truth behind her great-great-uncle’s tragic death. But she uncovers far more than she bargained for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a personal family story that takes us from Ireland to the industrial heartlands of England and Scotland, from the nineteenth century to the twentieth, Catherine gives voice to people often maligned by society and silenced by history – immigrants, women, the working classes. She unearths a tale of injustice and poverty, hope and resilience, and she is both angered and touched by what she finds. Catherine is driven to keep digging, to get to the very heart of life – and death – in the not-so-distant past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
