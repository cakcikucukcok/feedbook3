  <title>Provincetown - Karen Christel Krahulik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How did a sleepy New England fishing village become a gay mecca? In this dynamic history, Karen Christel Krahulik explains why Provincetown, Massachusetts&amp;#151;alternately known as &amp;#8220;Land’s End,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Cape-tip,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;Cape-end,&amp;#8221; and, to some, &amp;#8220;Queersville, U.S.A&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;has meant many things to many people.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Provincetown&lt;/B&gt; tells the story of this beguiling coastal town, from its early history as a mid-nineteenth century colonial village to its current stature as a bustling gay tourist destination. It details the many cultures and groups&amp;#8212;Yankee artists, Portuguese fishermen, tourists&amp;#8212;that have comprised and influenced Provincetown, and explains how all of them, in conjunction with larger economic and political forces, come together to create a gay and lesbian mecca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through personal stories and historical accounts, &lt;B&gt;Provincetown&lt;/B&gt; reveals the fascinating features that have made Provincetown such a textured and colorful destination: its fame as the landfall of the Mayflower Pilgrims, charm as an eccentric artists&amp;#8217; colony, and allure as a Dionysian playground. It also hints at one of Provincetown&amp;#8217;s most dramatic economic changes: its turn from fishing village to resort town. From a history of fishing economies to a history of tourism, &lt;B&gt;Provincetown&lt;/B&gt;, in the end, is as eclectic and vibrant as the city itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
