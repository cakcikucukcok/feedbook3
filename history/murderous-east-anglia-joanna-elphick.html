  <title>Murderous East Anglia - Joanna Elphick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joanna Elphick was born in East Anglia but grew up in the heart of London, where she obtained an LLB (Hons) in law and a postgraduate diploma in forensic science whilst hobnobbing with members of the Kray gang and joyriding a double-decker bus before returning to her Norfolk roots to lecture in law. She created the Norfolk Adult Education Access to Law Program during her time travelling around the country, giving extremely popular, albeit gruesome, evening lectures in witchcraft, smugglers, highwaymen, and local criminal history. She currently teaches law, criminology, and psychology at Dereham Sixth Form College in Norfolk.
Fascinating historical tales of murder, mystery, and suspense abound in Murderous East Anglia, a tome of thriller short stories documenting some of the darkest instances of true crime to ever plague the miry fens of Norfolk and Suffolk. The criminal intent behind these nefarious deeds stem from places deep within the human psyche, places of greed and jealousy that will send a shiver down your spine. So journey down the rabbit hole of crime and punishment, if you dare, and discover the secret history of a region with more suspicious deaths per capita than central London.
Among these historical tales meets the evil Bootlace Beach Killer; the Monster of Norwich; executioners; saucy maids; and heartless philanderers, such as Blomfield Rush and William Corder. In all these true crime stories, echoes of the past resound into the present, whether it be through the ghostly footsteps of the helpless victims or in the amendments made to laws of crime and punishment as a result of these tragedies." />
