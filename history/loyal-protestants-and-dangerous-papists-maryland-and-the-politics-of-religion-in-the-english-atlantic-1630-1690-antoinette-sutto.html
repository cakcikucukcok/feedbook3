  <title>Loyal Protestants and Dangerous Papists: Maryland and the Politics of Religion in the English Atlantic, 1630-1690 - Antoinette Sutto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Loyal Protestants and Dangerous Papists&lt;/i&gt; analyzes the     vibrant and often violent political culture of seventeenth-century America, exploring the     relationship between early American and early modern British politics through a detailed study     of colonial Maryland. Seventeenth-century Maryland was repeatedly wracked by disputes over the     legitimacy of the colony&#39;s Catholic proprietorship. The proprietors&#39; strange policy     of religious liberty was part of the controversy, but colonists also voiced fears of proprietary     conspiracies with Native Americans and claimed the colony&#39;s ruling circle aimed to crush     their liberties as English subjects. Conflicts like these became wrapped up in disputes less     obviously political, such as disagreements over how to manage the tobacco trade, without which     Maryland&#39;s economy would falter. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Antoinette Sutto argues that the best     way to understand this strange mix of religious, economic, and political controversies is to     view it with regard to the disputes over the role of the English church, the power of the state,     and the ideal relationship between the two-disputes that tore apart the English-speaking world     twice over in the 1600s. Sutto contends that the turbulent political history of early Maryland     makes most sense when seen in an imperial as well as an American context. Such an understanding     of political culture and conflict in this colony offers a window not only into the processes of     seventeenth-century American politics but also into the construction of the early modern state.     Examining the dramatic rise and fall of Maryland&#39;s Catholic proprietorship through this     lens, &lt;i&gt;Loyal Protestants and Dangerous Papists&lt;/i&gt; offers a unique glimpse into     the ambiguities and possibilities of the early English colonial world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
