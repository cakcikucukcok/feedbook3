  <title>America Declares Independence - Alan Dershowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Declaration of Independence as you&#39;ve never seen it before&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some of us cherish it with near-scriptural reverence. Others simply take it for granted. In this contentious new look at the Declaration of Independence, however, celebrated attorney Alan Dershowitz takes &quot;America&#39;s birth certificate&quot; and its principal author, Thomas Jefferson, to task.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dershowitz searches for the sources, history, and underlying reasoning that produced the Declaration and its particular language, from its reference to the &quot;Laws of Nature and Nature&#39;s God&quot; through the long list of complaints against the abuses of King George III. He points out contradictions within the document, notes how the meanings of Jefferson&#39;s words have changed over the centuries, and asks many disturbing questions, including:&lt;br&gt;* Where do rights come from?&lt;br&gt;* Do we have &quot;unalienable rights&quot;?&lt;br&gt;* Do rights to &quot;life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; have any meaning?&lt;br&gt;* How could slaveowners claim to believe that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;?&lt;br&gt;* Is the God of the Declaration the God of the Bible?&lt;br&gt;* Does the Declaration establish a Christian State?&lt;br&gt;* Are there &quot;Laws of Nature and of Nature&#39;s God&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Challenging, upsetting, and controversial, this brilliant polemic may anger you, delight you, or force you to reexamine your opinions. One thing&#39;s for sure: after reading America Declares Independence, you&#39;ll never take the Declaration of Independence for granted again." />
