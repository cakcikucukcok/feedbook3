  <title>Air Crash Investigations - Killing 290 Civilians - The Downing  of Iran Air Flight 655 By the USS Vincennes - Dirk Jan Barreveld, editor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On July 3, 1988, the American navy ship USS Vincennes, a Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser operating in the Persian Gulf, shot down Iran Air Flight 655, an Airbus A300B2-203, on its way from Tehran to Dubai. All 290 people on board died. Iran Air 655 flew within its assigned corridor. The USS Vincennes thought it had to deal with an Iranian F-14 fighter jet. From this point of view it was simply a case of mistaken identity. It is amazing that a guided missile cruiser with extremely advanced electronic capabilities such as the USS Vincennes, equipped with an ultra modern system such as Aegis, could make such a case of mistaken identity. Although the U.S. had to pay damages, a clear admission of guilt, the officers and commander of the Vincennes received awards and decorations after all." />
