  <title>Ancient Ghost Book No. 2 - Cowboy Bart Jeppesen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Testimonials from those that have had the benefit of working with Cowboy Bart Jeppesen 
In 2006 I enjoyed an exciting weekend with Bart. He showed me rocks made into symbols and symbols chipped into rocks. Siglas the Spaniards called them. They convey a universal language and speak of mysterious mines and hidden treasures. For those in the know, like Bart, they talk of the riches of the north slopes of the Uintah Mountains. While on his road of discovery Bart has uncovered and interpreted a vast number of symbols. I look forward, with anticipation, to his insights and understanding of these symbols.

I first met Bart on a Treasure Hunters Forum. I observed his excellent comments on other questions and decided to contact him with some of my questions. I was a neophyte treasure hunter in search of several treasures in the Caballo mountains of New Mexico. I had found quite a few treasure symbols, but I had no idea what they meant. I sent photos of these monuments and photos of the surrounding area to Bart. He sent them back to me all marked up. He could see things the Spanish had done in the landscape around the monuments.. It was then that I realized that Bart had a very unique talent. He had researched thousands of symbols.. This became helpful in deciphering maps of area. The problem was that most of the symbols had been lost to time. The trails were all broken. But Cowboy Bart could still follow them.

Cowboy Bart and I first connected back in 2009 when he contacted Sacred Science Institute regarding a diagram on our website from our recent translation of St. Yves de DAlveydres Archeometer (diagram can be found at this link: www.Sacredscience.com/archive/ArcheometerDiagrams.htm ). He mentioned that he used esoteric symbols as schematics to hunt for hidden treasure concealed within a framework of symbolic codes. I had never heard of anyone doing this before and thought it a fascinating subject and application of esoteric knowledge. I was unaware that many old hid- den treasures, buried by Templar&#39;s or hidden by past societies, were marked with such codes which could be traced by those initiated into the secret tradition. I encouraged Cowboy Bart to write a book about this fascinating subject, and still look forward to him doing so
