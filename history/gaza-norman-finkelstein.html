  <title>Gaza - Norman Finkelstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Gaza Strip is among the most densely populated places in the world. More than two-thirds of its inhabitants are refugees, and more than half are under eighteen years of age. Since 2004, Israel has launched eight devastating &amp;ldquo;operations&amp;rdquo; against Gaza&amp;rsquo;s largely defenseless population. Thousands have perished, and tens of thousands have been left homeless. In the meantime, Israel has subjected Gaza to a merciless illegal blockade.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; What has befallen Gaza is a man-made humanitarian disaster.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; Based on scores of human rights reports, Norman G.&amp;#160;Finkelstein&amp;#39;s new book&amp;#160;presents a meticulously researched inquest into Gaza&amp;rsquo;s martyrdom. He shows that although Israel has justified its assaults in the name of self-defense, in fact these actions constituted flagrant violations of international law.&lt;BR /&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;BR /&gt; But Finkelstein also documents that the guardians of international law&amp;mdash;from Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch to the UN Human Rights Council&amp;mdash;ultimately failed Gaza. One of his most disturbing conclusions is that,&amp;#160;after Judge&amp;#160;Richard Goldstone&amp;#39;s humiliating retraction of his UN report, human rights organizations succumbed to the Israeli juggernaut.&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; Finkelstein&amp;rsquo;s magnum opus is both a monument to Gaza&amp;rsquo;s martyrs and an act of resistance against the forgetfulness of history." />
