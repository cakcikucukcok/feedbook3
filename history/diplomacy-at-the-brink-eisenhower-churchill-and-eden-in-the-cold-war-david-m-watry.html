  <title>Diplomacy at the Brink: Eisenhower, Churchill, and Eden in the Cold War - David M. Watry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking new study of Anglo-American relations during the Cold War, Diplomacy at the Brink argues for a reevaluation of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#39;s foreign policy toward allies and enemies alike. Contrary to his reputation as a level-headed moderate, the Eisenhower who emerges in David M. Watry&#39;s exhaustively researched book is a conservative ideologue, a leader whose aggressively anti-Communist and anticolonialist foreign policies represented a major shift away from the containment policy of the Truman presidency. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watry contends that Eisenhower worked closely with John Foster Dulles to engage in aggressive brinksmanship that diametrically opposed Winston Churchill&#39;s diplomacy of &quot;peaceful coexistence.&quot; At a time when British economic interests favored cooperation with China, Eisenhower planned nuclear war against it; when Anthony Eden considered Gamal Abdel Nasser a Soviet agent and invaded Egypt, Eisenhower supported Arab nationalism and used economic and political blackmail to force Britain to withdraw. Such stances fractured the &quot;special relationship&quot; between America and Great Britain and played a vital role in the dissolution of the British Empire. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watry&#39;s thorough examination of the important clash of U.S.-U.K. foreign policy demonstrates that America&#39;s new anti-colonial policies and the unilateral use of American power against perceived Communist threats put Eisenhower and Dulles on a collision course with Churchill and Eden that rocked the world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
