  <title>Once There Were Dreams - Art Dickerson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The dreams of citizens in Indianola rose as it grew to be the second largest seaport on the Texas&#39; coast.
Blockaded, bombarded and occupied by Union forces, the town was a wreck at the end of the Civil War, but the persistent dreams seemed close to reality in the peace that followed. Trade flourished and population doubled until a hurricane destroyed half of the city in 1875. Those dreams that survived were dashed when a second hurricane finished the destruction in1886. This is the story of tough frontier people whose dreams survived difficult human events to be destroyed by nature. The events are thoroughly researched in correspondence and newspapers of the times and tied together by actions typical of pioneer people whose style survives today." />
