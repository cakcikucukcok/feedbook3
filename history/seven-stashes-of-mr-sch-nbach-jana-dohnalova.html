  <title>Seven Stashes of Mr. Schönbach - Jana Dohnalova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lets do a little test: When had been pronounced the names Jan Antonin  Bata or Tomas Bata, all literary experts know who they are. When we say Rudolf Schnbach  native of Cernovice in the Czech Republic, and founder of leather manufacturing in that region  not even one person in several hundred have any idea about him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, however, Rudolf Schnbach was compared to Bata with regularity. They had a lot in common such as their enterprising spirits and their tirelessly pragmatic thinking. Both of them were captains of industry. Rudolf Schnbach navigated his boat around an unknown island while the luxury boat of Tomas Bata navigated to the bright big cities. Did Rudolf Schnbach pay the price of being loyal to his own region because he started his business out of the way in Cernovice u Tabora?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book has been written in order to remind people about the life of a person, who, in only a few decades became the moving power behind organizing the life in that region. The story of Rudolf Schnbachs life is not just a regional story. It is the story that characterizes that historic time before and after the Second World War with clear common validity. It is a story that contains moral aspects relevant to today. The story of the life of the Cernovicky and Bata has been told basically from the memory of Jozef Hrdlicka, Schnbachs friend from childhood. A smaller part of the story has come together through historic documents and newspaper articles from the poisonous communistic times in the 1950s. This work is not strictly a historical scientific study, but it is more about remembering a highly admirable person, who demonstrated strength and focus while fighting against his disease, limiting conditions, and history.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The factory which he founded is still there  a quiet witness to the memory of all the changes. The factory is again in private hands. We can only feel pity that it is not in a Schnbachs hands.&lt;/p&gt;" />
