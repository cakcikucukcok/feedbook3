What is not well known is his role in the &amp;#147;Austrian Dreyfus Affair,&amp;#8221; which rocked Europe in the years leading up to WWII. While hiking in the Tyrolean Alps, Philippe&amp;#8217;s father was brutally murdered when Philippe went ahead on the trail. The year was 1928, Nazism was on the rise and Philippe, a Jewish 22 year old from Latvia, was charged with the murder.  He spent several years in an Austrian prison and the trial became a public scandal that pitted many prominent intellectuals, including Albert Einstein and Sigmund Freud, against the rising tide of fascism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Jump Artist&lt;/I&gt; is evocative psychological fiction based on this true story. Austin Ratner has extensively researched Halsman&amp;#8217;s life and tells the extraordinary tale of a man who transforms himself from a victim of rampant anti-Semitism into a purveyor of the marvelous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
