  <title>Livingstone&#39;s Hospital - Marion A. Currie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Scottish medical missionary-explorer David Livingstone wandered off course in his search for the source of the Nile and died from blood loss in May 1873 in a remote corner of north-eastern Zambia. His heart was buried under a tree in Chief Chitambo&#39;s village and his mummified body was carried back to the coast by some of his loyal companions. His remains were returned by sea to Britain and he was given a hero&#39;s burial at Westminster Abbey on the 18th. April 1874
Chitambo Hospital was built in memory of Livingstone over a hundred years ago, by his nephew, Malcolm Moffat. Two of Livingstone&#39;s grand-children worked there and his youngest daughter, Anna made a pilgrimage to the spot in 1915. Generations of nurses and doctors followed in Livingstone&#39;s footsteps and gave of themselves to keep the hospital running.
Livingstone&#39;s Hospital sets out to tell the story of a vibrant and living memorial  to one of history&#39;s poorly-understood heroes." />
