  <title>The Trail of Diplomacy -- Volume Three - Odeen Ishmael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume, the third of a three-part documentary, continues the history of the Guyana-Venezuela border issue from where Volume Two left off. It deals with the involvement of the office of the secretary general of United Nations ever since the termination of the Protocol of Port of Spain in 1982 in the efforts to settle the controversy. While this process did not make any progress as was anticipated, the two countries, despite some intermittent setbacks, maintained a generally cordial relationship that saw an advance in trade relations and political cooperation. The volume also examines the political and economic relations between Guyana and Venezuela since 1982 and the diplomatic activities they undertook to win international support for their respective positions. The authors own diplomatic involvement in the issue is also highlighted." />
