  <title>Smokey and the Fouke Monster: A True Story - Smokey Crabtree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Smokey and the Fouke Monster&amp;quot; tells a most interesting and unusual true story of how the town of Fouke, Arkansas became the center of attention for Monster hunters in the early and mid-seventies but also, how this one mysterious creature&amp;#39;s unwelcomed presence lead to the making of the now infamous movie &amp;quot;The Legend Of Boggy Creek&amp;quot;. The book tells of the risks and pitfalls sometimes associated with the business side of life and how it came to pass that he and the town folk of Fouke found themselves having to deal with forces far more sinister than that of an unknown creature inhabiting their surrounding bottom lands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is a true story. The author actually did live next door to the Fouke Monster for  several  years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The main purpose of this book is to keep the history of the Fouke Monster on a truthful basis. The true facts are told of what really went on behind the scenes during the filming&amp;#39; of a motion picture entitled &amp;quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&amp;quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The author tells how a country boy will fight, work and struggle for what he believes in and what his privacy means to him. He also tell how a large family survived and  found real happiness deep in the wilderness of Southwestern Arkansas. They had very little contact with the outside&amp;#39; world and the fast ways of life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Smokey tells points of interest in parts of his life hoping it will be educational to you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. How a legendary&amp;#39; wild boar was outdone after seventeen years of terrorizing the river bottom people around Fouke, Arkansas.&lt;br&gt;2. How to catch a catfish with your bare hands.&lt;br&gt;3. How to catch an alligator gar that weighs over two hundred pounds.&lt;br&gt;4. How to outsmart your deer&lt;br&gt;5. Smokey&amp;#39;s experience with snakes, all kinds of them, and many other things of interest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book has been in print since 1974, and is still selling many copies per year!" />
