  <title>Citizen Illegal - José Olivarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Citizen  Illegal&lt;/em&gt; is right on time, bringing both empathy and searing critique to the fore as a nation debates the very humanity of the people who built it.” —Eve Ewing, author of &lt;em&gt;Electric Arches&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this stunning debut, poet José Olivarez explores the stories, contradictions, joys, and sorrows that embody life in the spaces between Mexico and America. He paints vivid portraits of good kids, bad kids, families clinging to hope, life after the steel mills, gentrifying barrios, and everything in between. Drawing on the rich traditions of Latinx and Chicago writers like Sandra Cisneros and Gwendolyn Brooks,  Olivarez creates a home out  of  life  in the in-between. Combining wry humor with potent emotional force, Olivarez takes on complex issues of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and immigration using an everyday language that invites the reader in. Olivarez has a unique voice that makes him a poet to watch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;José Olivarez &lt;/strong&gt;is the son of Mexican immigrants. He is a co-host of the podcast, The Poetry Gods. A winner of fellowships from Poets House, The Bronx Council On The Arts, The Poetry Foundation, and The Conversation Literary Festival, his work has been published in &lt;em&gt;The BreakBeat  Poets &lt;/em&gt;and elsewhere. He is the Marketing Manager at Young Chicago Authors.&lt;/p&gt;" />
