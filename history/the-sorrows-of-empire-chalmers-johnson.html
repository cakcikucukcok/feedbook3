  <title>The Sorrows of Empire - Chalmers Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the author of the prophetic national bestseller &lt;i&gt;Blowback&lt;/i&gt;, a startling look at militarism, American style, and its consequences abroad and at home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the years after the Soviet Union imploded, the United States was described first as the globe&#39;s &quot;lone superpower,&quot; then as a &quot;reluctant sheriff,&quot; next as the &quot;indispensable nation,&quot; and now, in the wake of 9/11, as a &quot;New Rome.&quot; Here, Chalmers Johnson thoroughly explores the new militarism that is transforming America and compelling its people to pick up the burden of empire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reminding us of the classic warnings against militarism--from George Washington&#39;s farewell address to Dwight Eisenhower&#39;s denunciation of the military-industrial complex--Johnson uncovers its roots deep in our past. Turning to the present, he maps America&#39;s expanding empire of military bases and the vast web of services that supports them. He offers a vivid look at the new caste of professional warriors who have infiltrated multiple branches of government, who classify as &quot;secret&quot; everything they do, and for whom the manipulation of the military budget is of vital interest. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Johnson&#39;s provocative conclusions is that American militarism is putting an end to the age of globalization and bankrupting the United States, even as it creates the conditions for a new century of virulent blowback. &lt;i&gt;The Sorrows of Empire&lt;/i&gt; suggests that the former American republic has already crossed its Rubicon--with the Pentagon leading the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
