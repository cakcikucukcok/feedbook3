  <title>Speak You Also - Paul Steinberg, Linda Coverdale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1943, sixteen-year-old Paul Steinberg was arrested in Paris and deported to Auschwitz. A chemistry student, Steinberg was assigned to work in the camp&#39;s laboratory alongside Primo Levi, who would later immortalize his fellow inmate as &quot;Henri,&quot; the ultimate survivor, the paradigm of the prisoner who clung to life at the cost of his own humanity. &quot;One seems to glimpse a human soul,&quot; Levi wrote in &lt;i&gt;Survival in Auschwitz&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;but then Henri&#39;s sad smile freezes in a cold grimace, and here he is again, intent on his hunt and his struggle; hard and distant, enclosed in armor, the enemy of all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, after fifty years, Steinberg speaks for himself. In an unsparing act of self-examination, he traces his passage from artless adolescent to ruthless creature determined to do anything to live. He describes his strategies of survival: the boxing matches he staged for the camp commanders, the English POWs he exploited, the maneuvers and tactics he applied with cold competence. Ultimately, he confirms Levi&#39;s judgment: &quot;No doubt he saw straight. I probably &lt;i&gt;was &lt;/i&gt;that creature, prepared to use whatever means I had available.&quot; But, he asks, &quot;Is it so wrong to survive?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brave and rare, &lt;i&gt;Speak You Also&lt;/i&gt; is an unprecedented response to those dreadful events, bringing us face-to-face with the most difficult questions of humanity and survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
