Kennedys  decision as to whether we would go to nuclear war in 1961 with Cuba whose allies were with Russia. At that time this subculture generation lived by their own rules some grew to adulthood without changing, some did change. There was no nuclear bomb to this day and time which fell on humankind but a great deal of testing of nuclear bombs in the waters of the earth was done." />
