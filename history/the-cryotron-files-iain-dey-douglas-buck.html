  <title>The Cryotron Files - Iain Dey, Douglas Buck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Dr. Dudley Allen  Buck was a brilliant young scientist on the cusp of fame and fortune when he  died suddenly on May 21, 1959, at the age of 32. He was the star professor at  MIT and had done stints with the NSA and Lockheed. His latest invention, the  Cryotron--an early form of the microchip--was attracting attention all over the  globe. It was thought that the Cryotron could guide a new generation of  intercontinental ballistic missiles to their targets.  Four weeks before Dudley Buck&#39;s death, he was visited by a group of the  Soviet Union&#39;s top computer experts. On the same day that he died from a mysterious sudden bout of pneumonia, his close colleague, Dr. Louis Ridenour, was also  found dead from similar causes. Two top American computer scientists had  unexpectedly died young on the same day. Were their deaths linked?    Two years old when his father died, Douglas Buck was never satisfied with  the explanation of his father&#39;s death and has spent more than 20 years investigating  it, acquiring his father&#39;s lab books, diaries, correspondence, research papers  and patent filings. Armed with this research, award-winning journalist Iain Dey  tells, with compelling immediacy, the story of Dudley Buck&#39;s life and  groundbreaking work, starting from his unconventional beginnings in California  through to his untimely death and beyond. The  Cryotron Files is at once the gripping narrative history of America and its  computer scientists during the Cold War and the dramatic personal story of  rising MIT star Dudley Buck in the high-stakes days of spies, supercomputers,  and the space and nuclear race.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
