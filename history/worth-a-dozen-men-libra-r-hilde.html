  <title>Worth a Dozen Men - Libra R. Hilde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In antebellum society, women were regarded as ideal nurses because of
    their sympathetic natures. However, they were expected to exercise their talents only in the
    home; nursing strange men in hospitals was considered inappropriate, if not indecent.
    Nevertheless, in defiance of tradition, Confederate women set up hospitals early in the Civil
    War and organized volunteers to care for the increasing number of sick and wounded soldiers. As
    a fledgling government engaged in a long and bloody war, the Confederacy relied on this female
    labor, which prompted a new understanding of women’s place in public life and a shift in
    gender roles.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Challenging the assumption that Southern women’s
    contributions to the war effort were less systematic and organized than those of Union women,
    &lt;i&gt;Worth a Dozen Men &lt;/i&gt;looks at the Civil War as a watershed moment for Southern
    women. Female nurses in the South played a critical role in raising army and civilian morale and
    reducing mortality rates, thus allowing the South to continue fighting. They embodied a new
    model of heroic energy and nationalism, and came to be seen as the female equivalent of
    soldiers. Moreover, nursing provided them with a foundation for pro-Confederate political
    activity, both during and after the war, when gender roles and race relations underwent dramatic
    changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Worth a Dozen Men&lt;/i&gt; chronicles the Southern wartime
    nursing experience, tracking the course of the conflict from the initial burst of Confederate
    nationalism to the shock and sorrow of losing the war. Through newspapers and official records,
    as well as letters, diaries, and memoirs—not only those of the remarkable and dedicated women
    who participated, but also of the doctors with whom they served, their soldier patients, and the
    patients’ families—a comprehensive picture of what it was like to be a nurse in the South
    during the Civil War emerges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
