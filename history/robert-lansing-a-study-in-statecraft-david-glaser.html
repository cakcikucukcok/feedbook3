  <title>Robert Lansing:A Study in Statecraft - David Glaser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume is a study of the career of Robert Lansing, Woodrow Wilsons Secretary of State from 1915 to 1920. Holding this office during the neutrality period, Americas entry into World War I, and the peace negotiations that followed, his was an important position at a critical juncture in American history.
While many historians have dismissed Lansings contributions as insubstantial, this author believes otherwise. This work will show that in nudging a reluctant president toward war with Germany Lansing was persuasive indeed.  His most important contributions, however, came after Wilson returned to the United States in 1919 and became incapacitated during the fight for ratification of the Treaty of Versailles.  In the months that followed Lansing took the position of leadership in the Cabinet, holding important meetings on all of the issues of the day and reassuring the nation that the Executive branch of government still functioned. He also helped to resolve critical Mexican and Russian issues. 
Finally, and most importantly during this period, Lansing was in league with the strong reservations in attempting to force Wilson to accept modifications to the Treaty as a condition for ratification.  In this regard he provided the Republican opposition with important information regarding compromises made at Paris and the feelings of both himself and other Commissioners as to flaws in the Treaty.
Throughout his career Lansing was a strong proponent of his views on the key issues of the day. Sadly when faced with a President of equally strong views, often different from his own, Lansing resorted to indirection, deception and ultimately disloyalty in attempting to achieve his objectives. In the end Lansings many positive contributions were diminished by the actions of his final days." />
