If you are into adventure, love and vampires this book is the one for you!&quot; &lt;P&gt;--Vampirebooksite.com (regarding Turned)&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;The #1 Bestselling series!&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;This bundle includes books #10 (CRAVED) and #11 (FATED) in Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 bestselling series THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS. These two bestselling novels, all here in one convenient file, offer a great next step in the VAMPIRE JOURNALS series. Over 100,000 words of reading, all for an incredible price! It is a great deal, and it also makes the perfect gift!&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In CRAVED (Book #10 of the Vampire Journals), 16 year old Scarlet Paine struggles to find out exactly what she&#39;s becoming. Her erratic behavior has alienated her new boyfriend, Blake, and she struggles to make amends, and to make him understand. But the problem is, she can barely understand herself and what&#39;s happening to her. At the same time, the new boy in school, the mysterious Sage, comes into her life. Their paths keep intertwining, and although she tries to avoid it, he directly pursues her, despite the objections of her best friend, Maria, who has her own eyes set on Sage.&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In FATED (Book #11 of the Vampire Journals), 16 year old Scarlet Paine struggles to understand what&#39;s happening to her, as she wakes and realizes she&#39;s becoming a vampire. Alienated from her parents and her friends, the only person she has left to turn to is Sage, the mysterious boy who has quickly become the love of her life. Yet Sage, whose house she finds boarded up, is nowhere to be found. Scarlet, alone in the world, with nowhere left to turn, seeks out her friends and tries to reconcile with them. All seems to be patched up when they invite her to join them on a trip to an abandoned island in the Hudson-but as things get out of hand and Scarlet&#39;s true powers are revealed, who her friends and enemies are becomes more confusing than ever. &lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;THE VAMPIRE JOURNALS series has had a great plot..... The ending was a cliffhanger that was so spectacular that you will immediately want to buy the next book, just to see what happens.&quot; --The Dallas Examiner, regarding Loved&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&quot;Morgan Rice has really come up with a winner in this series. It is fast paced, filled with action, love, suspense, and intrigue!&quot;&lt;P&gt;--VampireBookSite" />
