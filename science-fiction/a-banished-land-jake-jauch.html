  <title>A Banished Land - Jake Jauch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I have befriended vampires and made a pact with a dragon. I have fought a war that was not my own, for a city that was not my home. I have made enemies simply because I am different. I won the fight against a werewolf horde and saved a city, but the fight is far from over for me. The repercussions of the war were far greater than anyone could have anticipated, and now my life and the lives of my best friend and my family are all in jeopardy. My name is Ivan, and time is running out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Banished Land: The Turning is more than your average vampire tale. Ivan, a man turned vampire by his beloved and best friend, made many enemies in the war against the werewolveson both sides of the battlefield. As a result, he and his friends and family are in grave danger. Now, Ivan has a choice: take the lifes blood of a human to gain the strength he needs to defeat his enemies and save those he holds dear, or stand by his values and find the strength to defeat his enemies from within.&lt;/p&gt;" />
