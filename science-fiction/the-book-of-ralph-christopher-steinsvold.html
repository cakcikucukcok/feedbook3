  <title>The Book of Ralph - Christopher Steinsvold</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;A message appears on the moon. It is legible from Earth, and almost no one knows how it was created. Markus West leads the government&amp;#8217;s investigation to find the creator.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;The message is simple and familiar. But those three words, written in blazing crimson letters on the lunar surface, will foster the strangest revolution humankind has ever endured and make Markus West wish he was never involved.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;The message is &amp;#145;Drink Diet Coke.&amp;#8217;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Coca-Cola denies responsibility, global annoyance with the beverage-industrial complex becomes indignation. And when his investigation confirms Coca-Cola&amp;#8217;s innocence, Markus West becomes one of the most hated men on Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Later, five miles above the White House, a cylinder is discovered floating in the night. It is 400 feet tall, 250 feet in diameter, and exactly resembles a can of Campbell&amp;#8217;s Chicken Noodle Soup. Nearly everyone thinks the cylinder is a promotional stunt gone wrong, just like the lunar advertisement. And this is exactly what the alien in the cylinder wants people to think.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ralph, an eccentric extraterrestrial who&amp;#8217;s been hiding on the moon, needs Markus&amp;#8217;s help to personally deliver a dark warning to the White House. Ralph has a big heart, a fetish for Andy Warhol, and a dangerous plan to save the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;br&gt;Looking upon the cylinder, Markus realizes we are not the ones in control. The unexpected guest becomes the host, and somehow humans never belonged: &amp;#147;We are the homeless orphans peeking through the banquet window. We are the frills of the universe gazing upon something unspeakably more central than ourselves.&amp;#8221;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
