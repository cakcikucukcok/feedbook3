  <title>When the Earth Shall Melt - Sunil Solomon Ghazan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author is a poet a writer and a social activist who has written various essays, articles and books. Some of his well-known books on social issues include, A Tribute to the Prostitute (On sex workers) Because I am a girl child (on the girl child), Homes Aflame (on domestic violence), A Mute Refute (violence against women), Adults amused but Child Abused (On Child Abuse). The author has a number of poems dealing with nature, romance, and spirituality, some of which have been published in various leading magazines, while the rest are being compiled for publication.
Have you ever imagined how the world would be when you and I would not exist on this planet apart from the future generation? As Christ put it, no one knows the day or the hour of the second coming. In whose time the prophetic visions would actualize is difficult to predict, but as the Spirit who has revealed these Prophetic Visions, to the author, he suggests that it will not be before 5050! The day, probably the fifth of May, 5050 would be when the whole globe has the same season because of the irresponsible way in which the caretakers, bring about an imbalance in the way nature controls the seasons. By then, it is estimated that different regions that enjoyed different climates would have the same, static very hot climate. The Sun would shine at its peak, melting the remaining snow on mountain tops, evaporating the sea waters, stopping the rains; in a nut shell the fiery heat would convert the planet into a furnace-drying all the water bodies, scorching trees and causing wild fires and thus the fertility of the soil would be lost leaving no scope for humanity and any creature to survive!" />
