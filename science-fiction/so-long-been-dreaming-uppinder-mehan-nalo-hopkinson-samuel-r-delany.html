  <title>So Long Been Dreaming - Uppinder Mehan, Nalo Hopkinson, Samuel R. Delany</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;So Long Been Dreaming: Postcolonial Science Fiction &amp;amp Fantasy&lt;/i&gt; is an anthology of original new stories by leading African, Asian, South Asian and Aboriginal authors, as well as North American and British writers of color.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stories of imagined futures abound in Western writing. Writer and editor Nalo Hopkinson notes that the science fiction/fantasy genre &amp;ldquo;speaks so much about the experience of being alienated but contains so little writing by alienated people themselves.&amp;rdquo; It&amp;rsquo;s an oversight that Hopkinson and Mehan aim to correct with this anthology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book depicts imagined futures from the perspectives of writers associated with what might loosely be termed the &amp;ldquo;third world.&amp;rdquo; It includes stories that are bold, imaginative, edgy; stories that are centered in the worlds of the &amp;ldquo;developing&amp;rdquo; nations; stories that dare to dream what we might develop into.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wealth of postcolonial literature has included many who have written insightfully about their pasts and presents. With &lt;i&gt;So Long Been Dreaming&lt;/i&gt; they creatively address their futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contributors include: Opal Palmer Adisa, Tobias Buckell, Wayde Compton, Hiromi Goto, Andrea Hairston, Tamai Kobayashi, Karin Lowachee, devorah major, Carole McDonnell, Nnedi Okorafor-Mbachu, Eden Robinson, Nisi Shawl, Vandana Singh, Sheree Renee Thomas and Greg Van Eekhout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nalo Hopkinson&lt;/b&gt; is the internationally-acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;Brown Girl in the Ring&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Skin Folk&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Salt Roads&lt;/i&gt;. Her books have been nominated for the Hugo, Nebula, Tiptree, and Philip K. Dick Awards; &lt;i&gt;Skin Folk&lt;/i&gt; won a World Fantasy Award and the Sunburst Award. Born in Jamaica, Nalo moved to Canada when she was sixteen. She lives in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uppinder Mehan&lt;/b&gt; is a scholar of science fiction and postcolonial literature.
