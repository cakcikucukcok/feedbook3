  <title>The Spruce Valley Miracle - Andrew Dequasie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Our civilization is indeed fortunate that Dr. Visionaire has been the first to solve the problem of turning back the clock on  the aging process.  Fortunate because the brilliant Dr. Visionaire is a highly ethical man.   He knows that his discovery can have disastrous consequences; a sudden population explosion as death becomes rare;  economic chaos as pension plans go bankrupt;  entrenchment of immortal dictators;  frozen opportunities for young people facing an immovable establishment.&lt;P&gt;	The doctor decides to expose the world to proof of his discovery in a small way without revealing the secret.  He knows that someone else will eventually discover the secret and perhaps have no compunction about releasing it, but hopes to give the world time to prepare for the consequences before it becomes an unleashed reality.&lt;P&gt;	He takes a job as resident physician in the Spruce Valley rest home for elderly people.  As the residents begin to regain their youth, he pretends to be mystified and encourages the rumor that the spring supplying water to the facility might be a second Lourdes.  Then he leads the owner of the rest home and the owner&#39;s wife into a plot to confirm the Lourdes hoax.  As the good doctor puts it, it&#39;s necessary to give God the credit --- and the blame.&lt;P&gt;	The doctor has chosen his fellow conspirators well.  They have a grand time establishing the hoax, which sometimes succeeds all too well.&lt;P&gt;	As the fame of the Spruce Valley Miracle spreads and the facility is doubled, the first of Doctor Visionaire&#39;s predictions comes true;  the Government wants a piece of the action in order to give certain VIPs preferred status.  Government money doubles the facility again, bringing a host of new characters and overwhelming paperwork.  The local Government agent, Jane Ormond, becomes the doctor&#39;s soul mate.&lt;P&gt;	Then the second of Doctor Visionaire&#39;s predictions comes true; the bad guy appears.  A renegade CIA man worms his way into Spruce Valley to search out the real source" />
