  <title>Bird Land - J. M. White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They had been in space a long time. They had examined every planet
within their trajectory as ordered. There had been six planets in their path
that they examined as possible sites for colonization and a nebula off in
the distance. The nebula was very beautiful, kind of purple and dark blue.
But, their orders were not to examine nebulas, but to fi nd a class M
planet that could be adaptable to humans. This was defi antly a class M
planet all the readings were perfect. But, with all the experts on board
no one could fi nd the source of the intelligence it took to make these
amazing gardens that circled the planet. Some fairly large birds had been
seen. But, there were no land animals with brains large enough to make
these gardens. They had to be gardens, gardens with uniformed rows of
growing crops. There were uniformed rows of trees as well and lines of
shrubs or hedge which divided the garden areas. This planet was placed
between three suns just right so as to have one side always warm. The
temperature was around 70 to 80 degrees and at night near 50 degrees.
The suns were orbiting in a slightly arched line with this small planet. The
planet and its two moons orbited around the larger sun. The smaller suns
being further away gave little light and a small amount of warmth just
enough so the other sides of the planet were not in total darkness at any
time. It had water and oxygen, breathable oxygen that meant no suits or
helmets. This planet was just what they were looking for. It was a small
green pearl in the vast darkness of space." />
