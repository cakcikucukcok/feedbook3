  <title>Curing Eve: Eve 1.0 Sequence - Chloelia Salome</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world seems on the verge of collapsing. The Chancellor is ready to redefine the human race. In his mind, a world with no remembrance of human history but the existence of a super human race is the ideal world. The Chancellor has every intention to play God in the evolution of mankind. Little does he know that he will be met with much retaliation from the underground resistance. Meanwhile, the resistance is fighting its own internal battle, with factions forming and questioning their leader&#39;s right to rule. When all seems to be lost for humanity, how does Evadene Mendes expect to change it all? In the chilling, final installment of the EVE 1.0 sequence, everyone&#39;s allegiance will be put on the line. Hatred will replace love as Evadene and her followers must choose between saving themselves or risking it all for humanity. Time is running out, and some of the biggest sacrifices will be made to put an end to the tyrannical rule of a sick man-the Chancellor of this wondrous nation." />
