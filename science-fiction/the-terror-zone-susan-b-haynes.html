  <title>The Terror Zone - Susan B. Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Susan, a beautiful girl, was brought up in a wealthy neighborhood.  She went to all the finest schools, sported only brand-name clothes, and hung with the elite in college.  
After graduation, she opens a great psychiatric office and continues her storybook life.  Time passes, and she doesnt quite feel satisfied with the prince of her dreams.  Feeling bored, lonely, and used to getting what she desires, she decides to look into child rearing.  Adoption isnt enough for Susan as she is concerned that the child might not have her similar traits, so she chooses to be artificially inseminated.
She paints a beautiful picture for her and her little girl, Lindsey, until one day, she wakes up and her daughter, now her only reason for living, has been snatched away by a merciless, foreboding stranger.
Susan pleads for help from the Feds, the cops, even her boyfriend and her neighbors.  But with absolutely no leads and only dead ends at every turn, her aid dwindles.  Susan finds herself alone, losing faith in the system, and thoroughly disheartened.
Weeks pass and insomnia hovers.  Susans beautiful fairy-tale life spins out of control and desperation sets in.  Just when she thinks she cant take any more, she gets a phone call from an anonymous stranger claiming to know where Lindsey is.  
Feeling unloved and ignored, she takes matters into her own hands, but being wound up and suppressed for so long turns Susan into a whirling dervish.  Blustering through her small town and discovering several lost children, none of whom are Lindsey, supplies Susan with new enthusiasm and a rekindled spirit.  Headstrong and on a mission, Susan uses her profession as a tool, selfishly putting her needs before those of her patients and using them as guinea pigs.
Susan hires a private investigator who disappears, only to be found attached to a bridge, sporting a bomb.  The detectives brother, who happens to be a cop, declares hell help Susan when he realizes her stories of mind-reading, telekinesis, psycho-suggestion, kidnapping, and murder could be less than exaggerated.
Susan frantically turns to hypnosis and manipulation as a means to an end.  Trying not to hurt her patients or anyone else around her, she delves deeper and deeper into their psyches.  Exploiting her patients and meddling with her ruthless kidnappers life inevitably guides the veiled pieces into place.  
What Susan hasnt counted on was that her most feared and hated enemy has invaded her every thought, and now she fears the walls she tried so hard to build for herself are tumbling down bit by bit.  Exasperated, she stumbles upon information that literally have her questioning her own sanity. 
She realizes shes gone too far to stop now, so while she rampages through Florida, a maniacal stranger is bowling down friends, patients, and acquaintances.  Her house is burned down; her boyfriend is in the hospital; her patients are in jeopardy, jailed, or wounded; and her best friend is now also missing.  Susan comes to the conclusion that the key to unconditional solace lies within her daughter and the malevolent psycho holding her hostage.
Not even sure of her own mind, Susan takes a death-defying leap toward connecting with the cold-blooded monster who holds her daughter.  As the monster trickles mercilessly through Susans subconscious, the dizzying migraines inevitably lead her to sances, mind-melding, and precarious liaisons that prove crucial in exacting her revenge." />
