  <title>The Apocalypse Chronicles - Julian Mok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="3150. A world in turmoil. Wracked by the ravages of near constant warfare and natural disaster, the embattled populations of the surviving nations are clinging onto the last remnants of civilisation. The land of Echelon, once a proud and free country, has now fallen under the dark reign of a thousand presidents, each worse and more bloodthirsty than the last. Over eight hundred years they have locked their people behind the very seawalls once used to protect them against the forgotten calamities of the past, and over time all memory of life outside the walls that hem them in have faded.  Countless freedom fighters have given their lives to try and free Echelons people from the tyrannical masters who set them to work building weapons of destruction with which to crush the remaining countries of the world. But President Immanuel Starks deadliest plans have finally been taken from his hands and placed into Senator Dale Marshalls. Barely, managing to escape his home with the help of special forces soldiers from around the world called Agents, he must now use that information to rally the warring and disparate factions of the world around the banner of freedom, all the while trying to stay one step ahead of Starks deadliest soldiers. Will he and the Agents be up to the task of reuniting the Earth, or will the Presidents long awaited plans finally succeed?" />
