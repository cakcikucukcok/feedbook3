  <title>Game of the Gods - Jay Schiffman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;The A-Team and X-Men in an exotic futuristic setting. Great adventure with many layers.&quot; --Kevin J. Anderson, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author    &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay Schiffman&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Game of the Gods &lt;/i&gt;is a debut sci-fi/fantasy thriller of political intrigue and Speilberg-worthy action sequences in the vein of Pierce Brown&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Red Rising&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max Cone wants to be an ordinary citizen of the Federacy and leave war and politics behind. He wants the leaders of the world to leave him alone. But he&#39;s too good a military commander, and too powerful a judge, to be left alone. War breaks out, and Max becomes the ultimate prize for the nation that can convince him to fight again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one leader gives the Judge a powerful device that predicts the future, the Judge doesn&#39;t want to believe its chilling prophecy: &lt;i&gt;The world will soon end, and he&#39;s to blame&lt;/i&gt;. But bad things start to happen. His wife and children are taken. His friends are falsely imprisoned. His closest allies are killed. Worst of all, the world descends into a cataclysmic global war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to find his family, free his friends, and save the world, the Judge must become a lethal killer willing to destroy anyone who stands in his way. He leads a ragtag band of warriors--a 13-year old girl with special powers, a mathematical genius, a religious zealot blinded by faith, and a former revolutionary turned drug addict. Together, they are the only hope of saving the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
