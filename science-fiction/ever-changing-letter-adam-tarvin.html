  <title>Ever Changing Letter - Adam Tarvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I give her, a confused look as I continue moving forward
into the huge room with brick walls that  appears to have
been repaired in a few places recently. After a few steps
farther into the room, the door closes behind me. I look
around for any other ways to leave this pla ce if its
something  I cant handle. One door, no windows, no roof,
and nothing but walls around me. This doesnt look too
hard I say out loud to myself. I start to chuckle
considering the only thing in here that I might have to
fight against would be some mice or maybe a mosquito or two.
I stop mid-step as I feel the cold shiver run down my
back . I now know that this might in fact be tougher
than Id  imagined. I hear the eerie growl coming from
above me. As I look up, I start to tremble as I can only
imagine what would be above me. As my eyes lock onto
its, we stare at each other and I know it can sense the
fear in me. It leaps the 50 foot drop to the ground inside
of  the brick room . This will be the first  time Ive ever 
faced, let alone seen a dragon." />
