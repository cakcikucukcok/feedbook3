  <title>The Boy with the Apron Cape - G. G. Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Boy with The Apron Cape is a Story for all of us that wore an Apron and in which our reality became a world made of purpose, truth and justice, powers and destiny! To a boy who wants to be a super hero, you will soon figure out that an Apron is the missing link to your Super Hero outfit of under roos. For an unsuspecting female, you will not be left out to also find purpose for you in this world. The apron has been labled, The Apron Cape, it is magical and has been searching for you, the most righteous soul.  The Great Wizard Elfrin Noble has been searching for you. He has been searching because a great darkness has come to your world to destroy you and your kind. The blood that is powered by a desired crystal stone lives, and it is the only thing that will destroy this evil. 
There is magic and Wizardry, and Spaceships, and Lordships, and an Evil Son, Lhourdis, who resents you. There are Russians, who are seeking out the power of the stone. There are Aliens that have been watching the events unfolding, considering Earth a threat, and there is chaos, and you, you Scott Freeman, Scott Free, for short, must save the World! You must overcome obstacles. You must overcome despair, heartbreak, and disappointments. You must accept that you are the worlds only hope, in fact, you are the hope of the entire universe! Sometimes there is no happily ever after, even though you are, Scott Free,
