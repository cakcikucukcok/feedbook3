  <title>Becoming Death - John David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The road to hell is paved with good intentions.&quot;
A proverb from the past.
A critique of the present.
A forecast of the future.
If your leaders have good intentions, how do they know they are not on the road to hell?
They do not know.
They cannot know.
They can only believe.
What if they are wrong?
What if you believe they are wrong?
How can you know you are right?
You do not know.
You cannot know.
You can only believe.
What if there are two beliefs in your society, one old and one knew?  Two beliefs at war with one another.
Which side would you take?
Where would you stand?
What would you do?
Would you be Senator Kedney, and use any means to destroy the old to create the new?
Would you be Scylla Daer, and use any means to crush the new to preserve the old?
Would you be Bretan Sobert, and use only honourable means to fight for the old?
Would you be Police Chief Kukushkin, and use only honourable means to fight for the new?
Would you be Rudi Kingston, and believe in neither, so use any means to fight for your own values?
Would you be Fauna Kortney, and believe in nothing, so use any means to fight for yourself?
Would you be Wispy, and use any means to destroy both old and new in the service of something greater?
Who would you be?
What would you do?
