  <title>The Vela Kurv Legacy Part 1 - Riley Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One beautiful commando defends Earth from its most lethal alien enemy while she is surreptitiously betrayed and set-up to die. &quot;When I became a wo-man, I put away childish things.&quot; - I Corinthians 13:11 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;THE WILES OF VELA KURV&quot; is the story about a strong, sexy, smart woman who could save her world, a world not to dissimilar from Earth today. The story starts at birth and progresses to her young adulthood. She develops supernatural abilities through genetics and exposure to alien DNA as a fetus and this causes an abandonment of love from the one person she adores as a child, her father. Because of her gifts Lorabella Kurv Wiles must become the deliverer of mankind and the keeper of the timeline. Because of the life Lorabella chooses, her nemesis lies in wait for revenge. As a secret agent, a girl becomes a woman. She investigates how to fight against invading aliens. During the hunt, a deal is struck to kill her, but only after the completion of her mission. Her maturation and battle culminates into a passionate love affair with the one person she can trust, Dr. Dan Gibson Val Demure. The story is a seductive, science fiction tale of the struggle for the survival of the planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
