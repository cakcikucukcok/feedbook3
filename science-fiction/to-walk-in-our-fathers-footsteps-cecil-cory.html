      <meta name="description" content="After the war with the waste landers to the north the remaining people were freed, hope and some prosperity returned to the land. Many families that had been separated for generations were once again reunited. These new mouths to feed and house soon became a burden on the land and the people to the south.  A rift had grown between the Twin Suns system and the Sol system. The Council of Elders said that Karl Artuso and all off worlders were to leave their planet. The younger generation where grown and it was their time to chose their paths. Many had joined the Space Rangers to help the Sol system defend themselves from the pirates that were attacking the shipping trade. Others had attended the school in the Blue Mountain and were trying to change the planet for a better future. Little did they know that their nemesis was about to return." />
