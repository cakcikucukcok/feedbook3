  <title>Building Harlequin&#39;s Moon - Larry Niven, Brenda Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The first interstellar starship, John Glenn, fled a Solar System populated by rogue AIs and machine/human hybrids, threatened by too much nanotechnology, and rife with political dangers. The John Glenn&#39;s crew intended to terraform the nearly pristine planet Ymir, in hopes of creating a utopian society that would limit intelligent technology. &lt;br&gt;But by some miscalculation they have landed in another solar system and must shape the gas giant planet Harlequin&#39;s moon, Selene, into a new, temporary home. Their only hope of ever reaching Ymir is to rebuild their store of antimatter by terraforming the moon.  &lt;br&gt;Gabriel, the head terraformer, must lead this nearly impossible task, with all the wrong materials: the wrong ships and tools, and too few resources. His primary tools are the uneducated and nearly-illiterate children of the original colonists, born and bred to build Harlequin&#39;s moon into an antimatter factory. &lt;br&gt;Rachel Vanowen is one of these children. Basically a slave girl, she must do whatever the terraforming Council tells her.  She knows that Council monitors her actions from a circling vessel above Selene&#39;s atmosphere, and is responsible for everything Rachel and her people know, as well as all the skills, food, and knowledge they have ever received. With no concept of the future and a life defined with duty, how will the children of Selene ever survive once the Council is through terraforming and have abandoned Selene for its ultimate goal of Ymir?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
