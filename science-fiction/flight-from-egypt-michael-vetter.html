  <title>Flight from Egypt - Michael Vetter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Malik, Nathan, and Sarina careen from one dangerous escapade to another while plagues from the God of the Hebrews upend their life on the Nile and humiliate Egypts pathetic gods. Biblical themes of Gods power over nature and His faithfulness to the people of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are woven into a fictional plot of teenage adventure and intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Black Falcon and his gang of mercenaries steal priceless treasures and tons of gold from the sealed tomb of Queen Hatshepsut in the Great Place Valley. An Egyptian general, a Theban police inspector, and an eccentric inventor help the teenage characters pursue the Black Falcon while the maniacal Pharaoh Thutmose III pits his will against Almighty God. An unrelenting chase from Karnak and Thebes in the south to Memphis and Giza in the north barely pauses while Egypt crumbles and millions eventually press their backs against the Red Sea for a showdown against Pharaoh. Who will safely pass through the Red Sea and who will perish by the hand of the LORD of Hosts?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous adventures in this series introduced captivating, speculative technologies and &lt;i&gt;Flight From EgyptAdventures Along the Nile&lt;/i&gt; will not disappoint its readers. News of divine plagues spreads via a nationwide heliographic network, secret codes point to a traitor somewhere in the Great House palace, Imhoteps &lt;i&gt;Horus Eye&lt;/i&gt; aerial ship saves the Valley of the Kings from a Nubian attack, and a megavolt device illuminates the pyramids of Giza with a blinding flash. These and other inventions will capture and hold your attention from cover to cover.&lt;/p&gt;" />
