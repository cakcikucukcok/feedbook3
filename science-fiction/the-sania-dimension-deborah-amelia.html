  <title>The Sania Dimension - Deborah Amelia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this science fiction, the reader is introduced to Ava, a Light Being from another dimension. While conducting a guiding mission on Earth she compromises her principles and must redeem herself by returning to Earth to a lifetime she once lived centuries earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ava is faced with the challenges of learning to exist as a human again while still possessing advanced intellectual and existential knowledge gained from her Light Being existence. She is faced with the challenge of juggling her identity while living within a dual reality wondering if and when she will be able to return to Sania.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reader is given a glimpse into the human experience at a deeper level recognizing how daily life can affect us in ways we never imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The character takes us on a journey of ups and downs attempting to re-assimilate into her human self while remaining undetected. The author shows the reader what its like for an outsider looking in and is given a peek into the experiences seeded by understanding metaphysics, laws of attraction, and existential theory, all playing a crucial yet hidden role in creating the lives we imagine.&lt;/p&gt;" />
