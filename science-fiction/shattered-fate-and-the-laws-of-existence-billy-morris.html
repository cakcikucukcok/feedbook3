  <title>Shattered Fate and the Laws of Existence - Billy Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A thousand years before this story begins, two worlds, Eden and Metro, collided to create a new world. According to the law of existence, both worlds should have been destroyed in the collision, but an unknown force called magic held the remaining planet together. Even after a thousand years, there are some people who understand that every time someone is born with magic, forces that hold this world together are lessened.
A very powerful warmonger named Lord Haden prepares for an invasion of Utopia. Utopia is soon overrun, but as Haden pushes north with his dragons, he is attacked by a powerful witch.
Soon rumors spread that Haden is dead and his dragons lost. As his armies break apart, Sabrina, Hadens youngest child and heir to his throne, takes control of the palace guards and starts moving her army toward Utopia to claim her empire. Other warmongers begin migrating toward the small kingdom to claim a part of Hadens empire and to find his dragons. Another one of Hadens children, Lord Scorpion, takes control of the forces in Utopia and tries to unite them once more. 
Hadens dragon guild manages to capture the young witch Angelina, whom they believe has killed their master. When the dragon guild realizes that every warmonger within a thousand leagues would like to get their hands on Angelina, they leave her in the City of Hela.
Unable to control her power, Angelina is being hunted by the warmonger Scorpion and his raiding parties. She is soon reunited with an old woman. Faced with her nightmares and having nowhere to go, she leaves her home with the old woman and her companions. With armies descending and powerful magic converging, Angelina must find a way to control her power and prevent the death of millions of people." />
