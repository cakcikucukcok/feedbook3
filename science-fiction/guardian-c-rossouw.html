  <title>Guardian - C. Rossouw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="About the Book
This adventure begins in a small mining town, on a night just like any other, when an evil entity descends from a distant world on to ours. With it, it brings a vast army, invisible to the eye, but very real indeed and powerful enough to disturb the balance of the Universe.
In this dark hour, mankind calls out for a champion and it is through an ancient force, alien to us, that this call is answered. A force so ancient, that its origin is unknown to all, but an outsider that has observed the course of our history, and befriended us through the centuries. This gentle giant is the last of his kind, and holds the very essence of mankinds salvation in his hands. The knowledge of a great power that has maintained order and peace throughout the Universe and guarded it from all evil.
This force, known as the Guard of Legion, were now once again resurrected in the likes of four, reluctant heroes of Earthly descend.
Among them is their leader, an unlikely warrior, enhanced with a power so intense, that it stands to challenge any force in the Universe. To unlock his true potential though, he must first find himself and in a sense become a man. He carries a great responsibility and the faith of the known world now rests on his shoulders. He is the Guardian, the champion of mankind and the leader of the most elite fighting force in the Universe.
Together with the mighty hi-Tech army of a hidden civilization in the Bermuda Triangle, they must overcome the odds and save the day. They are the Earths last line of defence against attacks from beyond, and while the rest of humanity continues with its day-to-day existence, they will do battle with the greatest evil that the world has ever known.
Will the Guards find unity in themselves and overcome their own fears to overthrow the evil warlord called Malicious? Only faith will decide who wins the day!
