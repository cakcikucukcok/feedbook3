  <title>Overlord - David L. Golemon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the stunning conclusion to the Matchstick Man saga that began with Event and continued with Legacy, the End of Days is upon humanity---invasion has arrived!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some speculate that the war between the two worlds began 700 million years ago, while others say it started in 1947 over a small town in New Mexico called Roswell. Regardless of dates, the war is now upon us, and after centuries of watching, the enemy attacked. The plans of a million years are finally ready for what we have always known was coming---Armageddon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As world allies fall to the wayside, a growing political faction from several nations sends a clear signal that cooperation between the superpowers and the lesser states cannot succeed. As nations start a mad scramble to realign their military structures, the war begins silently in the depths of the oceans, and flares to global brightness with the first military strike in history between two different worlds. Only one element in the arsenal of the world can possibly give Earth a fighting chance at survival---a small being that has already saved the world once in the Arizona desert is now called upon to outthink his former masters---the Matchstick Man. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Matchstick Man searches for the real motivation behind the invasion, the Event Group is the one entity that refuses to accept the inevitable defeat of humankind. They&#39;ve learned that the answer to this war has always been here on earth buried deeply in our ancient past, and that they may even hold the clue to salvation inside their own artifact vault. But with the devastating loss of its military arm and one of their leaders, Colonel Jack Collins, the group is being torn apart by internal conflict and devastating personal decisions. Even worse, the group&#39;s old enemies have returned to take revenge, and the worst fears of Department 5656 are realized---a breach in security allows intruders to get at the secrets inside the complex in Nevada. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can the group come together to defeat their enemy and defend the planet? As the war wages on, countries fall, nations fight to the last man, and the fate of the planet depends on a few good men and women in this action-packed thrill ride from New York Times bestselling author David L. Golemon.&lt;/p&gt;" />
