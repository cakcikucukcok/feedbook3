  <title>Valley of Dreams - Stanley Weinbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Captain Harrison of the Ares expedition turned away from the little telescope in the bow of the rocket. &amp;quot;Two weeks more, at the most,&amp;quot; he remarked. &amp;quot;Mars only retrogrades for seventy days in all, relative to the earth, and we&amp;#39;ve got to be homeward bound during that period, or wait a year and a half for old Mother Earth to go around the sun and catch up with us again. How&amp;#39;d you like to spend a winter here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Dick Jarvis, chemist of the party, shivered as he looked up from his notebook. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d just as soon spend it in a liquid air tank!&amp;quot; he averred. &amp;quot;These eighty-below zero summer nights are plenty for me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; mused the captain, &amp;quot;the first successful Martian expedition ought to be home long before then.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Successful if we get home,&amp;quot; corrected Jarvis. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t trust these cranky rockets&amp;mdash;not since the auxiliary dumped me in the middle of Thyle last week. Walking back from a rocket ride is a new sensation to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Which reminds me,&amp;quot; returned Harrison, &amp;quot;that we&amp;#39;ve got to recover your films. They&amp;#39;re important if we&amp;#39;re to pull this trip out of the red. Remember how the public mobbed the first moon pictures? Our shots ought to pack &amp;#39;em to the doors. And the broadcast rights, too; we might show a profit for the Academy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What interests me,&amp;quot; countered Jarvis, &amp;quot;is a personal profit. A book, for instance; exploration books are always popular. Martian Deserts&amp;mdash;how&amp;#39;s that for a title?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lousy!&amp;quot; grunted the captain. &amp;quot;Sounds like a cook-book for desserts. You&amp;#39;d have to call it &amp;#39;Love Life of a Martian,&amp;#39; or something like that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Jarvis chuckled. &amp;quot;Anyway,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;if we once get back home, I&amp;#39;m going to grab what profit there is, and never, never, get any farther from the earth than a good stratosphere plane&amp;#39;ll take me. I&amp;#39;ve learned to appreciate the planet after plowing over this dried-up pill we&amp;#39;re on now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll lay you odds you&amp;#39;ll be back here year after next,&amp;quot; grinned the Captain. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll want to visit your pal&amp;mdash;that trick ostrich.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Tweel?&amp;quot; The other&amp;#39;s tone sobered. &amp;quot;I wish I hadn&amp;#39;t lost him, at that. He was a good scout. I&amp;#39;d never have survived the dream-beast but for him. And that battle with the push-cart things&amp;mdash;I never even had a chance to thank him.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A pair of lunatics, you two,&amp;quot; observed Harrison. He squinted through the port at the gray gloom of the Mare Cimmerium. &amp;quot;There comes the sun.&amp;quot; He paused. &amp;quot;Listen, Dick&amp;mdash;you and Leroy take the other auxiliary rocket and go out and salvage those films.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Jarvis stared. &amp;quot;Me and Leroy?&amp;quot; he echoed ungrammatically. &amp;quot;Why not me and Putz? An engineer would have some chance of getting us there and back if the rocket goes bad on us.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
The captain nodded toward the stern, whence issued at that moment a medley of blows and guttural expletives. &amp;quot;Putz is going over the insides of the Ares,&amp;quot; he announced. &amp;quot;He&amp;#39;ll have his hands full until we leave, because I want every bolt inspected. It&amp;#39;s too late for repairs once we cast off.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
