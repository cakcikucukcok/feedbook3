  <title>The Syndi-Jean Journal: Year 3 - bck kwan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Studying and living at The Facility was meant to be a fresh start, but the past refuses to be ignored. Now in her third year, Syndicessca Jeannie finds her past catching up even as she navigates a relationship with Walker in one world and discovers a lost child in another. 
As nightmares appear to be spreading among the other trainees, Syndi-Jeans perception on reality and existence comes into question as the walls between worlds begin to crumble. When a malevolent force makes itself known, the stakes are raised, and lives are thrown into the balance. For Syndi-Jean, facing that force means facing her greatest fear. 
It was a year she would have her happiest moments and hardest losses. And in that, she would discover her potential and herself (Remington)." />
