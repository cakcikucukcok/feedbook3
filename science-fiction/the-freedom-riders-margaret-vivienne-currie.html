  <title>The Freedom Riders - Margaret Vivienne Currie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Just as Hordea is about to embark on a journey into adulthood, he realizes the citizens of the three main planets in the Federation are dying at the hands of Boridus, their treacherous leader. As the citizens battle a mysterious disease and years of peace begin to vanish, Hordea seizes an opportunity to read Boriduss mind and learn of his diabolical plan. Seemingly left with no other choice, Hordea leads a group of friends to escape the planet aboard an old ship.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As they head toward Amphosea, a safe haven where they hope to develop a plan to unseat Boridus and restore freedom, they are soon encouraged to return home to rescue their families. But when their pilot talks them into a daring journey back to Argwis via a slingshot, the friends celebrate their success with a wild party that causes all of them to fall into a coma and their unreliable ship to hurl through space without a pilot. With Boridus in hot pursuit, Hordea is eventually captured and transported to planetary headquarters, the others incarcerated, and communication severed with their mentor.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this continuing sci-fi adventure, a freedom fighter and his compatriots wage a dangerous battle for independence as a dictator unleashes his wrath onto the galaxy.&lt;/P&gt;" />
