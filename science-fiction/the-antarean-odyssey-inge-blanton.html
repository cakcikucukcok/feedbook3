  <title>The Antarean Odyssey - Inge Blanton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Antarean Odyssey is about the birth of a people and the fiery end of the home-world. It is a story about adventure, love, heartbreak, sorrow and of overcoming difficult and often dangerous situations. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book One&lt;/BR&gt;
The Labors of Jonathan. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; One evening Jonathan Wright overhears a conversation about a world wide cartel, and interstellar trade agreement, and aliens called Altruscans. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book Two&lt;/BR&gt;
The Original Four &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Book two is about four girls coming from diverse cultures and backgrounds, and they are the beginning of the Antarean People. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book  Three&lt;/BR&gt;
Loss of Eden &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The ending of childhood might feel like the loss of Eden. It is time for the four to meet the world. The story is about an expedition that goes terribly wrong. Sabrina races home against time and death only to find a deserted ship. The Antares is only manned by androids.  &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book Four&lt;/BR&gt;
Starship Trefayne &lt;/P&gt;
Sabrina didn&#39;t mind leaving Acheron. But she was not too crazy about having to drop her studies and then, being a guinea-pig integrating a Chiron starship. If Captain Thalon aka Sargon, thought to have Sabrina safely on the Trefayne, he will soon learn otherwise. &lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt; The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book Five&lt;/BR&gt;
Misalliance &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Now is the time for Commander Sarah Thalon, Chief Medical Officer of the Worldship Antares to leave home to become an intern on Madras to fulfill a requirement of the Starfleet of the Planetary Alliance. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book Six&lt;/BR&gt;
Assignment Earth &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Sabrina&#39;s assignment is to see if Earth is ready to join the Planetary Alliance. She finds that Earth is still under the threat of the Altruscans with a new and a much more dangerous dimension added to it. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book Seven &lt;/BR&gt;
Matched &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Sabrina meets the love of her life, Martel Alemain. Also, since the rift between the two universes are closing, Sabot for the last time enlists Sabrina&#39;s help to round up the remaining shapeshifters. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Books still to be published are
The Antarean Odyssey&lt;/BR&gt;
Book Eight, &lt;/BR&gt;
I, Sargon. &lt;/P&gt;" />
