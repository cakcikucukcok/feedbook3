  <title>The Warrior Within - Angus McIntyre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Angus McIntyre makes his debut with &lt;i&gt;The Warrior Within&lt;/i&gt;, a mind-bending science fiction adventure about a man with many people living in his head&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Karsman has a dozen different people living in his head, each the master of a different set of skills and hoping to gain mastery of Karsman&#39;s body. He survives on a backwater planet dominated by the Muljaddy, a mostly ambivalent religious autocracy, where devotion and prayer can be traded in for subsistence wages and enough food to survive. Surrounded by artifacts of a long dead civilization, the population survives off its salvage, with Karsman eking out an uneventful life as the unofficial mayor of his small town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that life is soon interrupted, when a group of commandos arrive, coming from the wastelands as only off-worlders could. They&#39;ve come to kill a woman, or so they say. At first the commandos merely threaten as they search. Unable to find what they&#39;re looking for, they begin to ratchet up their measures, separating the men from the women, instigating violent encounters, and eventually staging a coup against the Muljaddy and his Temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faced with the task of protecting his quiet town and a woman he might love from the commandos who could want to kill her, Karsman must balance between maintaining his personality and harnessing the personas whose skills he desperately needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
