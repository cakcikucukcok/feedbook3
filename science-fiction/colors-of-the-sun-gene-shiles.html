  <title>Colors of the Sun - Gene Shiles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stories of &lt;i&gt;Colors of the Sun - A Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, each separate and complete, share a common background. In Tribes of the Orange Sun, crowded Earth colonizes a faraway earthlike planet. The saga continues, more than a generation later, on the new planet in Pale Yellow Sun and on Earth in White Sun Chronicle.&lt;p&gt;
Tribes of the Orange Sun: Scientist Adam Hampton, skeptical of Earth Governments rush to colonize, suspects that the lives of the many volunteers are at great risk. But he can only watch and wait while three of his best friends, and millions of others, begin their epic adventure.&lt;p&gt;
Pale Yellow Sun: The people of isolated and idyllic Emil become entangled in Earths continuing problems. Young Andy Landis delays his personal plans when he is asked to participate in a critical decision. He soon learns that he must choose between the ruin of his beautiful homeland and mass murder.&lt;p&gt;
White Sun Chronicle: Struggling Earths food supply is destroyed. Senator Neil Silvers and a handful of others find sanctuary from the chaos in a secure building, but their small food cache soon runs out. The group ventures outside to face a world where humans compete as never before." />
