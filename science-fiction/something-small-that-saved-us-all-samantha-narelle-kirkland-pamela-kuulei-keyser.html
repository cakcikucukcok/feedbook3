  <title>Something Small That Saved Us All - Samantha Narelle Kirkland, Pamela Kuulei Keyser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Once you loved and respected JFK, you never got over him.
Although he was young in years, this man was unusually astute when he became president of our nation. With many years of thought-provoking study of history and world leaders, such as Winston Churchill behind him, he assumed office with a clear concept of how he could make the world a better place in which to live. More importantly, he had the inner fortitude required to take us there.
Elected as our president while in his midforties, he was tall, charmingly handsome, and possessed a smile that captivated women while expressing self-assurance to men. He embodied a buoyant attitude and a ready intellect, which enabled him to inspire Americans to achieve wondrous things. The key was to get everyone working toward such goals. This would require, accordingly, that each of us be empowered with an equal chance to participate. 
He desired to be remembered as a leader of high purpose and firm resolution. He was at his best when he was inspired and thus was far ahead of the people he governed. Hed beckon to us over his shoulder as if to say, Get your hearts and minds ready, and then follow me! Like a track star imbued with fleetness of foot, his mind raced ahead, striving to achieve the best for everyone. 
Will we ever catch up?" />
