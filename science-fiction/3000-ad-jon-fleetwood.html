(Excerpt from 5th page of Chapter 18)
&quot;The Horsemen approached Jared and Destiny with unimaginable speed.  Scant yards away, their horses stopped and reared with anger flashing across their eyes as Gabriel stepped forward forbidding their passage.  Gabriel stood in front of them defiantly, a shining white star standing against thunderous clouds of fire.  Gabriel seemed so small and fragile, yet Destiny could feel the power surging from him in waves that could be released to instantly subdue the Horsemen if the need arose.  The horses stamped and snorted impatiently as the Horsemen looked at Gabriel, at the humans, and then looked up to the heavens.  The Horsemen paused and raised their swords to the sky as blood red fire erupted from the edges of their blades.&quot;" />
