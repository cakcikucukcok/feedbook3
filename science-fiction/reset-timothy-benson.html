  <title>Reset - Timothy Benson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In Reset, author Timothy Benson offers contemporary stories of ordinary people who encounter unexplainable and life-altering situations, often of their own making. Unprepared for the things they face, they struggle to change the course of events before they reach the point of no return.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In Whatever You Say, a young mans journey toward a new start begins with a white lie. The lie leads to another, then another, until the mans real identity starts to blur with a new persona that threatens to ruin his plans.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;An incredible string of luck makes a businessmans life seem too good to be true in Way North of Lucky. He soon realizes his good fortune has a negative and dangerous effect on everyone around him, leading to a frightening conclusion about his future.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Almost Life of Leonard Paduszka tells the story of three imaginative young people who concoct a scheme to create a fake person. The plan succeeds beyond their expectations, until a homeless man gives their faux man more reality than they intended.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Bandit and the Barista recounts the story of a man whose gambling addiction leads him to plan a crime that, at first, seems foolproof. When his plan to temporarily blame a total stranger goes awry, he scrambles to save both the innocent mans future and his own.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Rich in visual imagery, memorable, offbeat characters, and dark humor, the stories in Reset offer a view of the often strange and dangerous ways ordinary people navigate through modern culture.&lt;/P&gt;" />
