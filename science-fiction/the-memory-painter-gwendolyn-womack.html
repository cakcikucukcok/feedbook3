  <title>The Memory Painter - Gwendolyn Womack</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;WINNER OF THE RWA PRISM AWARD FOR BEST TIME TRAVEL/STEAMPUNK AND A FINALIST FOR BEST FIRST BOOK&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A thriller, a romance, a 10,000-year adventure...&lt;i&gt;The Memory Painter&lt;/i&gt; is &quot;the guy-meets-girl story as you&#39;ve never heard it before&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Refinery29&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bryan  Pierce is an internationally famous artist, whose paintings have  dazzled the world. But there&#39;s a secret to Bryan&#39;s success: Every canvas  is inspired by an unusually vivid dream. Bryan believes these dreams  are really recollections--possibly even flashback from another life--and  he has always hoped that his art will lead him to an answer. And when he  meets Linz Jacobs, a neurogenticist who recognizes a recurring  childhood nightmare in one Bryan&#39;s paintings, he is convinced she holds  the key.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their meeting triggers Bryan&#39;s most powerful dream  yet--visions of a team of scientists who, on the verge of discovering a  cure for Alzheimer&#39;s, died in a lab explosion decades ago. As his  visions intensify, Bryan and Linz start to discern a pattern. But a  deadly enemy watches their every move, and he will stop at nothing to  ensure that the past stays buried.&lt;/p&gt;" />
