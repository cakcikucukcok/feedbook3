  <title>Encore - Dave Lindsay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;CRYONICS - The frigid controversy surrounding the Ted Williams affair sparked national interest in the science, but there were many philosophical aspects that were never even considered.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The human soul...Does it actually exist? If it does and departs the body when a person dies, as most religions contend, will it return upon rejuvenation? Encore explores the most alarming scenario of all, what if it doesnt? What if &quot;something else&quot; takes its place? &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Time is running out for an elite cartel of five prestigious American scientists working on a Top-Secret Cryonic project. To advance their efforts, a young scientist (Eddie Grisham) and his associate (Maggie Bennett) are invited to participate in the balance of the clandestine  project. The cartels sole objective: to rejuvenate one of the most prominent icons of the twentieth century, a man secretly frozen down in 1966.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In spite of her unbridled commitment to the project, Maggie clings to her spiritual convictions and is compelled to explore the philosophical prospects that are inherently linked. Armed with a well-supported theory, she coaxes her agnostic companion into the scientific realm of theological tenet. Modern technology fused with an esoteric interpretation of biblical prophecy serves to justify the incredulous perspective and sets the stage for an enigmatic revelation.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If Maggies theory was correct, the monumental feat could provide the fabled Antichrist with a socially acceptable means of achieving incarnation.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;As conjectured, the magnificent achievement transcends a serendipitous portal which unknowingly permits Satan himself to fill the spiritual void. But its the secret identity of their iconic patient that provides ENCORE with its arcane visionary twist. The scientists had no way of knowing that their experiment would inadvertently catapult the world into the prophetic Last Days.&lt;/P&gt;" />
