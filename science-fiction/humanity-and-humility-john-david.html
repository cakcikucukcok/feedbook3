  <title>Humanity and Humility - John David</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Identical twin sisters  orphaned and separated and adopted at birth  neither aware of each others existence  neither aware of their unique heritage nor the corrupt motivations behind their adoption. 
Emily grows up in poverty and injustice and with little parental interest. 
Tiara grows up in wealth and plenty but with little parental interest. 
Meanwhile Humility grows up in poverty but under harsh parental control. 
Matt sought to force Emily to become the daughter Matt wanted  but he failed. Or did he? 
Astra sought to force Tiara to become the daughter Astra wanted  but she failed. Or did she? 
Modesty sought to force Humility to become the daughter Modesty wanted  and succeeded. Or did she? 
Edward housed, fed and clothed Tiara and hoped for the best. 
The system housed, fed and clothed Emily and hoped for the best. 
Modesty housed, fed and clothed Humility and demanded the best. 
Then Modesty married Edward while Tiara and Emily met in Juvenile Detention and three girls life trajectories intertwined for both good and ill. 
Where will they end up when the dust settles? 
Read Humanity and Humility  a sequel to A Grandmother Named Desire by John David  and find out." />
