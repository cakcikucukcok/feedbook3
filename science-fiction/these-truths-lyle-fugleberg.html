  <title>These Truths - Lyle Fugleberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The woods are so wild, its impossible to behold them without terror  so said Daniel Boone in his day. 
Its the same world John Anderson finds himself in thousands of years later in Easter Armageddon, where he loves and fights and tragically survives for the next twenty years.
These Truths, a sequel, begins with the aftermath of the latest tragedy. Coinciding mountains away, by a process of scintillating complexity, is the resurrection of the remainder of the Chosen, fifteen carefully selected young men and women from the twenty-first century. They, together with John, had pledged to undertake the greatest challenge mankind had ever attempted, the difficulty of which was evident in the history of his consistent failures.
With the characteristics of a world nature has reclaimed, there are many subtleties to address and hurdles to cross and dangers to face; but the greatest and most difficult of all, as it has always been, is man and bad wolf within him.
To succeed, effort and intention and goodness will not be enough 
 there will be blood." />
