  <title>Bradbury Stories - Ray Bradbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For more than sixty years, the imagination of Ray Bradbury has opened doors into remarkable places, ushering us across unexplored territories of the heart and mind while leading us inexorably toward a profound understanding of ourselves and the universe we inhabit. In this landmark volume, America&amp;#39;s preeminent storyteller offers us one hundred treasures from alifetime of words and ideas -- tales that amaze, enthrall, and horrify; breathtaking journeys backward and forward in time; classic stories with the undiminished power to tantalize, mystify, elate, and move the reader to tears. Each small gem in the master&amp;#39;s collection remains as dazzling as when it first appeared in print.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is magic in these pages: the wonders of interstellar flight, a conspiracy of insects, the early bloom of love in the warmth of August. Both the world of Ray Bradbury and its people are vivid and alive, as colorfully unique as a poker chip hand-painted by a brilliant artist or as warmly familiar as the well-used settings on a family&amp;#39;s dining room table. In a poor man&amp;#39;s desire for the stars, in the twisted night games of a hateful embalmer, in a magnificent fraud perpetrated to banish despair and repair a future, in a writer&amp;#39;s wonderful death is the glowing proof of the timeless artistry of one of America&amp;#39;s greatest living bards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one hundred stories in this volume were chosen by Bradbury himself, and span a career that blossomed in the pulp magazines of the early 1940s and continues to flourish in the new millennium. Here are representatives of the legendary author&amp;#39;s finest works of short fiction, including many that have not been republished for decades, all forever fresh and vital, evocative and immensely entertaining. This is Bradbury at his very best -- golden visions of tomorrow, poetic memories of yesterday, dark nightmares and glorious dreams -- a grand celebration of humankind, God&amp;#39;s intricate yet poignantly fallible machineries of joy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
