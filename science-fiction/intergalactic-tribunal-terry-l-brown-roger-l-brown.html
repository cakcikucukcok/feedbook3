  <title>Intergalactic Tribunal - Terry L. Brown, Roger L. Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Planet Ship Earth has had many mythical stories. Intergalactic Tribunal is about the greatest one ever conceived, developed, and implemented. This powerful story grabbed the inhabitants of earth and sky, and convinced them that to believe is to know. As a result they remain in perpetual ignorance never seeking to know. 
The main character of this Intergalactic Gospel Fiction is the only son of a man-made God, who created the universe in which he resides. He has no mate male of female. Everyone who wishes to live forever in bliss must pledge their lives to this Man Made God via the worship of his only begotten son. 
Those that are not afraid to think will find the content of this book intriguing and thought provoking. Theyll realize that outrageous thoughts they have had are shared by others. Theyll be relieved to know they are not alone in this confusion, called human society. 
Technological components are unprecedented, trailblazing and surprising. For example the technology that implanted hostile entities into the blood stream to be manifested by the pressing of certain fingers, coughing and spitting. 
War Theatres will add this to their think tank data banks globally. Its scary to think of the effect this would have in the hands of so-called terrorists. 
This book can be viewed as a self help educational reference tool, a thought provoker, or just a fun book to read. There are elements of interest for all matured minds, beings that are searching for clarity, and those exploring beyond the matrix of illusion. 
The fact that man created God so God could make him is evident. It is not hard to create a belief system complete with a god of your design, and giving him or her all the powers you can imagine. This and other thought provoking questions are asked and answered. 
I am very much aware that this book will not change anyone. My hope is that readers will be motivated enough to investigate its content to see if there be anything that might enhance their lives or that of someone they know and care about. 
I hope Intergalactic Tribunal will provide food for thoughts to the degree that readers will discuss it among their families, friends, and associates. I trust all will find something of value. I invite you all to engage the process of thinking to arrive at decisions which impact your lives. 
Refuse to be a slave to anyones belief. 
Seek to Know Always." />
