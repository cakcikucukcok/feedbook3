  <title>GermLine - Nelson Erlick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In gene therapy, the damaged or defective chromosomes of an individual patient are corrected by the addition of new genes introduced into the patient&#39;s DNA. This is a dangerous and controversial technique, on the cutting edge of medical science. &quot;GermLine&quot; gene therapy is even more radical. By altering the reproductive cells, the germ cells, of a single individual, you can forever change the genetic makeup of that person--and all of his or her future descendants!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But who should control such an awesome power? The government? The medical establishment? Or a hidden conspiracy of the rich and powerful?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Kevin Kincaid, a brilliant scientist whose life has been scarred by personal tragedy, is on the verge of a major breakthrough. After years of research and experimentation, he has developed a biological vector capable of introducing new genes into the germ cells of unborn children while they are still in their mothers&#39; wombs. With this vector, doctors will be able to eradicate genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis and Down syndrome for all generations to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kincaid&#39;s discovery also raises the specter of wholesale genetic engineering, of changing the very nature of humanity itself, which attracts the attention of dangerous forces, including a ruthless government agency, an international conspiracy of wealthy industrialists, and radical terrorists who will stop at nothing, including murder, to keep Kincaid&#39;s breakthrough from transforming the world as we know it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon the targeted scientist finds himself at the center of a covert war to control the future of human evolution. Betrayed and deceived by those closest to him, he can trust no one-not even a mysterious woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to his long-dead wife. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
