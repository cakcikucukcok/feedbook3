      <meta name="description" content="When Jake first arrived on Virago 4, he found a world that had been destroyed by war 30 centuries ago. Before his first tour ended he&#39;d discovered what had caused the planet&#39;s destruction. On his next trip he discovered the terrible truth of why it had happened. And now he and the rest of the inhabitants of this world are going to find out who caused it all. A creature known by the ancient people of Earth as the Destroyer; it has no problem wiping out an entire planetary population for profit. And now just as it was about to collect on an endeavor that has spanned thousands of years, its property along with the profit was stolen. It knows who is to blame; the human Jake Simms, and it&#39;s time to deal with these creatures once and for all. But first it will do a little recruiting on the humans&#39; home world. It has discovered someone from Jake&#39;s past. They shouldn&#39;t be too hard to convince. Besides revenge is such an excellent motivator." />
