  <title>The New World - Chris Adrian, Eli Horowitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An innovative story of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;love, decapitation, cryogenics, and memory by two of our most creative literary minds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jorie has just received some terrible news. A phone full of missed calls and sympathetic text messages seem to indicate that her husband, Jim, a chaplain at the hospital where she works as a surgeon, is dead. Only, not quite--rather, his head has been removed from his body and cryogenically frozen. Jim awakes to find himself in an altogether unique situation, to say the least: his body gone but his consciousness alive, his only companion a mysterious, disembodied voice.&lt;br&gt;     In this surreal and unexpectedly moving work, Chris Adrian and Eli Horowitz spin a tale of loss and adjustment, death and reawakening. Simultaneously fabulist and achingly human, &lt;i&gt;The New World&lt;/i&gt; finds Jorie grieving the husband she knew while Jim wrestles with the meaning of life after death. Conceived in collaboration with Atavist Books, &lt;i&gt;The New World&lt;/i&gt; interrogates love and loss in the digital era.&lt;/p&gt;" />
