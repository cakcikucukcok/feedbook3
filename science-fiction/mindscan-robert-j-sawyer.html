  <title>Mindscan - Robert J. Sawyer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hugo Award-winning author Robert J. Sawyer is back with &lt;i&gt;Mindscan&lt;/i&gt;, a pulse-pounding, mind-expanding standalone novel, rich with his signature philosophical and ethical speculations, all grounded in cutting-edge science. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jake Sullivan has cheated death: he&#39;s discarded his doomed biological body and copied his consciousness into an android form. The new Jake soon finds love, something that eluded him when he was encased in flesh: he falls for the android version of Karen, a woman rediscovering all the joys of life now that she&#39;s no longer constrained by a worn-out body either. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But suddenly Karen&#39;s son sues her, claiming that by uploading into an immortal body, she has done him out of his inheritance. Even worse, the original version of Jake, consigned to die on the far side of the moon, has taken hostages there, demanding the return of his rights of personhood. In the courtroom and on the lunar surface, the future of uploaded humanity hangs in the balance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mindscan&lt;/i&gt; is vintage Sawyer -- a feast for the mind and the heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Sawyer is one of Canada's best known and most successful science fiction writers. He is the only Canadian (and one of only 7 writers in the world) to have won all three of the top international awards for science fiction: the 1995 Nebula Award for The Terminal Experiment, the 2003 Hugo Award for Hominids, and the 2006 John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Mindscan.<br /><b><i>Mindscan by Robert J. Sawyer</i></b> | Robert J. Sawyer's Mindscan is a riveting read. It is a great page turner that one can hardly put down. Mindscan falls precisely in the genre category of science fiction but it nonetheless gets close to blurring the line between so called genre and literary fiction - yes it is that good in its scope and style.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Mindscan - Robert J.
