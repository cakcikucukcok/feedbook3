  <title>The Superiors Fantasy - C. Ereca Vulcan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Superiors fantasy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Superiors Fantasy is a love story about a castle that was built by some of the most important people who made a difference to the world we are living in today. The only people allowed to live and visit the castle are people without a wicked jealousy as the red door gives a pictorial image of their emotions that need to be rectified. The story tells of 14 intelligent gentlemen who gravitated to the Moon, Mars and beyond. Some of their names are already on the moon in the form of named craters. This story is important to the human race, to help us understand our emotions and to give credence to these important men who moulded the earth into what we know today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astronomy, stars, planets, constellations and importantly, Jupiters story to all earthlings. This story is the fuselage of the aircraft that is our consciousness, preparing us for our return to the Moon via Mars where we give the high intelligent beings the knowledge of this story, whereby they will then trust us to build on their land. It teaches us the importance of incorporating the power of righteousness, esotericism and the paranormal into our lives. The Superiors Fantasy examines the existence of higher intelligent beings and gives lessons to them on the emotional stance of earthlings. We have all loved before and will again. SF will enable you to embrace the truth of your identity, to gain sexual and sensual knowledge through the writings of the author, a golden black galactic being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book covers the sexuality of all humans and gives an insight about how the dollar of America came into existence. A story of true love and friendship. It will inspire one to work on themselves within an esoteric framework from a spiritual angle. A story that encompasses all nationalities. A universal story.&lt;/p&gt;
