  <title>The Opaque Veil - Kenneth Wallsmith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Hugh Wilkie is an officer of the Colonial Fleet. The only person alive able to meld his mind with the HCSIS computer. A system capable of not just controlling a Dread Naught but mankinds last hope in discovering the vector of the horrid disease targeting only humans one world after another. Hugh solves the mystery of the Pliil Plague but no one believes what he discovers.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Wilkie finds out what has also been hidden from him by the Science Academy. He must fight not only to save humanity he must fight to save his own life with his new found powers. Hugh travels the Earth and the galaxy with his friends, to The Opaque Veil and back, in an attempt to save his people from doom.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Hugh Wilkie comes to a realization he is part of an ancient prophecy when the truth of his own origins begin to surface. Hugh must struggle not only with the moral choices of modern humanity and its questionable ethics in modifying their genetic base, but he must grapple with the hard questions of his own path, identity and very soul.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;It reads like a fast-paced adventure story from the pulps or cliff-hanger series of old but with a decidedly modern sensibility&lt;/i&gt; -Rob Allison, Copy Editor" />
