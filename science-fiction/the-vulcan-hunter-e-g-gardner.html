&lt;p&gt;Thats the premise of the novel Dr. Peter Cashman has just finished reading. He thought it was a pretty good story, so he shares it with his father, a seismologist. His father agrees that its an intriguing read. He also thinks it may not be a work of fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earth is slowly being torn apart as Peter and his team race to find the author.

&lt;p&gt;Peters father sends him on a quest to save as many as possible, while involving as few as possible. For Peter, the hardest part of accepting his fathers mission is finding the faith to believe the story is true. Finally a believer, he must now recruit other specialists to join him, without the benefit of knowing the full scope or goal of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
