  <title>Oura - Tom Byckowski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seventeen year old Noah Brookton  simply wants a normal life. Although, it seems as he is destined to a life of unrequitedness. While living in a foster home with his brother, Benjamin, Noah derives strength by touching the pendant around his neck. After a violent household encounter, Noah suddenly finds himself in a strange house with no memory of the past week. What Noah does not know is that he is now in the magical land of &lt;i&gt;Oura&lt;/i&gt;, a place where the mind flourishes and his destiny may have already been decided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decisions and darkness lie around every corner after Noah is told by his housemates, Novella and Illacia, that they have been awaiting his presence. Chosen as a Mindwalker; Noah must defeat King Hythis as they navigate towards Lyria  a secret place hidden from the king in hope of a rebellion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this exciting science fiction fantasy, a teenager must learn to trust his inner strength and given powers while attempting to save a magical land from a dark future. There comes a time in every persons life where the person they once were, collides with the person they are going to become.&lt;/p&gt;" />
