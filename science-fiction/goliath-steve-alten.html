  <title>Goliath - Steve Alten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Terrorism. Acts of Oppression. The threat of nuclear war.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;What if one madman aboard a vessel could end these fears forever?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commander Rochelle &quot;Rocky&quot; Jackson is aboard the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan when the &quot;unsinkable&quot; naval vessel and its entire fleet are attacked from the depths and sunk. As Rocky struggles to stay alive, a monstrous mechanical steel stingray surfaces, plowing the seas it now commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goliath: A nuclear submarine Rocky helped design almost a decade ago, a top secret DoD project canceled when the schematics were destroyed by her former fiancé and U.S. Army Ranger, Gunnar Wolfe. Powered by its five jet-pump propulsors and hydrodynamically shaped to be virtually undetectable under water, the sub has one more feature that separates it from all other vessels on the open seas: SORCERESS -its biochemical computer brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington D.C.: Rocky learns that the Goliath&#39;s plans were not destroyed but secretly sold to the Chinese. Having constructed the $8 billion dollar warship, the Chinese become victims themselves when the sub is hijacked by the project director, Simon Bela Covah, a computer genius who once served under Rocky&#39;s command at the Navy&#39;s Undersea Warfare Center. The attack on the carrier fleet indicates that Covah is hunting down warships in an attempt to arm himself with nuclear weapons. The president appoints Rocky&#39;s father, General Michael &quot;Bear&quot; Jackson, to locate and destroy the Goliath. Against Rocky&#39;s wishes, Bear decides they will need Gunnar Wolfe&#39;s help. Gunnar, who has served five years in Leavenworth for espionage, is not exactly thrilled to be rejoining the people who ruined his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aboard the Goliath: Simon Covah and his crew share a common bond: They are all victims of violence and oppression. Covah, a Russian, witnessed his Chechan wife and daughters brutally murdered at the hands of his own people as he was tortured. Now the computer genius has one mission: to rid the world of oppressive governments while forcing humanity to disarm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To accomplish this, he plans on giving the world a real lesson in Armageddon.&lt;br&gt;Armed with enough nuclear weapons to destroy North America, Covah issues his Declaration of Humanity to the world. If his demands are not met, consequences will be paid.&lt;br&gt;f0&lt;br&gt;Could the threat of violence forge a lasting peace?&lt;br&gt;But there is another player in this life-and-death chess match. Unbeknownst to the Goliath crew, SORCERESS has become self-aware. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the computer is developing its own agenda...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
