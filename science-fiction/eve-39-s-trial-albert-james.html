  <title>Eve&#39;s Trial - Albert James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Trapped aboard a space station, Sheena Steele&#39;s options are limited, to say the least.  She&#39;s just been fired from her position and literally has nowhere to go, but still more worried about her best friend, Tishia Bach, who was facing execution.  A mesmerizing emerald-eyed beauty, who attracts trouble from everywhere with her charismatic and alluring nature.  Tish could hold the very secrets of life within her enigmatic body- and that&#39;s why she&#39;s a target.  Only Sheena knows Tish&#39;s secret....for now.
	Their only hope seems to be finding refuge with Vigdor Beckenstein, a brilliant but obscure physicist that is intrigued by the extreme behavior of a frightened woman in love, and upon closer examination finds unusual, but attractive character traits.  After disguising the fugitives and introducing them to society he rocks their world with a plan that only destiny could have designed, while well hidden secrets are unexpectedly revealed.
	Explosive unpredictability only surpassed by originality.  This is the epic journey of two incredible women with all the odds stacked against them, thrown into elite circles and witnessing behind the scene corruption of world powers.  Don&#39;t miss the sensational conclusion, &quot;Legend of the White Dragon.&quot;" />
