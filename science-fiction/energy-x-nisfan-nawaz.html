  <title>Energy X - Nisfan Nawaz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Before Alex Watson stumbled across that mysterious rock in the foothills of North Carolina, his biggest concern was finding a job after graduation where he could do some good in the world. Now he&amp;rsquo;s running for his life, fleeing assassins sent by the most powerful men in America, and trying to get into a war-torn country that might just hold the secret to the global energy crisis.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The first thing Alex notices about the rock unearthed by the landslide is that it&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;glows&lt;/em&gt;. The second is its strange effect on any electronics around it. This is no normal specimen from the geology lab; this is a meteorite with enough clean energy to power the United States&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;forever&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alex takes his discovery to a prominent green energy firm, not realizing that the company is a front funded by Big Energy. Too late, he discovers that their real mission is to bury promising technologies&amp;mdash;and the people who discover them.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Alex flees, his enemies hot on his trail. With the help of an underground group called Occupy the World, he learns about a more powerful meteorite that&amp;rsquo;s still out there, hidden in one of the most unstable, dangerous corners of Africa. If Alex and his friends can get to it, he&amp;rsquo;ll have an energy source that could power the entire world. But only if his pursuers don&amp;rsquo;t get to him first &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;" />
