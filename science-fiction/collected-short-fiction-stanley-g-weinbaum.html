  <title>Collected Short Fiction - Stanley G. Weinbaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stanley Grauman Weinbaum (also wrote as John Jessel and Marge Stanley) (1902-1935) was an American science fiction author. His career in science fiction was short but influential. His first story, „A Martian Odyssey”, was published to great acclaim in July 1934. Most of the stories fall into two categories: travelogue types that explore different planets, and the others with Dixon Wells and the great scientist Van Manderpootz, who invents amazing stuff that Wells manages to use to break his own heart over and over again. A collection of stunning short stories written in the 30’s but ahead of their time in their depiction of bizarre alien life forms. The final story in the book, „Proteus Island”, is a bit of an anomaly. Instead of being in the future or space, it seems set more present day." />
