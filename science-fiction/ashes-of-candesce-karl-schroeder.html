  <title>Ashes of Candesce - Karl Schroeder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A world of endless sky, with no land, no gravity:  this is Virga. Beginning in the seminal science fiction novel &lt;i&gt;Sun of Suns&lt;/i&gt;, the saga of this striking world has introduced us to the people of stubborn pride and resilience who have made Virga their home; but also, always lurking beyond the walls of the world, to the mysterious threat known only as Artificial Nature. In &lt;i&gt;The Sunless Countries&lt;/i&gt;, history tutor Leal Hieronyma Maspeth became the first human in centuries to learn the true nature of this threat. Her reward was exile, but now, in &lt;i&gt;Ashes of Candesce&lt;/i&gt;, Artificial Nature makes its final bid to destroy Virga, and it is up to Leal to unite the quarrelling clans of her world to fight the threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ashes of Candesce&lt;/i&gt; brings together all the heroes of the Virga series, and draws the diverse threads of the previous storylines together into one climactic conflict. Blending steampunk styling with a far-future setting and meditations on the posthuman condition, &lt;i&gt;Ashes of Candesce&lt;/i&gt; mixes high adventure and cutting-edge ideas in a fitting climax to one of science fiction&#39;s most innovative series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
