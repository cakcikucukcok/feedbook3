  <title>The Armor of the King - Justin R. Mullins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Caleb has heard whisperstales of a King of Old who gave his life for his peoplebut such stories seem like legend in a day when the evil Shadow Lord rules the Land. In the quiet fishing village of Cliff Cove, even the Shadow Lord seems distant until one day his evil forces attack and everything Caleb loves is taken from him.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escaping with his life, Caleb sets out on a quest to find the Truth. As he learns more about the King of Old, Caleb discovers that he must obtain the Kings armor to be ready to fight the Shadow Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  But gaining the armor is no easy task. For each piece he must pass a test and prove he is worthy to bear the armor of the One True King.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the help of a friend and faith in the King, Caleb will fight a jackal and a vampire, befriend gnomes and dragons, and stand against a banshee and a corrupt official all leading up to an epic battle to defeat the Shadow Lord and free his people.&lt;/p&gt;" />
