      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Once-Other: Building a Road towards a New Political Civilization!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The story-line: Immigrants from Earth settled a desert world. They fought Earth for their Independence--and won. But now, Freedom has been stolen from them by the politicians back on Earth. So they fight their Second War of Independence, but this one is unique in the manner it is executed for it builds that Road to a New Political Civilization!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;While it took me a while to catch on to the authors style, the concepts on the structure of a truly free society are pearls worth the work to obtain.&amp;rdquo; Excerpt AMAZON&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Therefore, Once-Other is not merely an entertaining story but is instead much, much more. This is the building of a way to a better tomorrow for all citizens, all Patriots, irrespective of their culture, race, creed or religion or lack of belief.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once-Other was written deliberately as fiction. It needed to be entertaining while at the same time bring into existence a road upon which we and all the Peoples of Earth may tread. A road to be walked without violence which should only be the last resort.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Care to find out how this can be done?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Start now!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Within Once-Other&amp;#39;s design is a road bound by our Constitution leading directly to those changes and defenses. From there we march onwards and assign safeguards against all enemies of Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is not a story of doom and gloom let alone a Doomsday tale.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is a story of Freedom&amp;#39;s victory; our victory should we choose to travel this road.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It is strange in places, stranger in others.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t complain about circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It does throw light upon current circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t attempt to solve circumstances with that age-old solution...kill all those who are too much of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It does destroy oppression without a shadow of doubt.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In the mapping out of the road to victory, it does what no novel has ever done before. On its pages, you will find outlined the simple actions we will take and in doing these return a tomorrow endowed with our Founders vision of Freedom.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And those ideas are sewn into the fabric of the tale, some here, and some at the start or end.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once-Other is a story written into the teeth of the attack upon those Freedoms We the People of these United States of America cherish and hold dear. The story starts with the adoption of our Founding documents by a people on a faraway planet who once lived on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They flourish under small government due to ideas added to their founding document. That document being the original Constitution of these United States.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Welcome to Once-Other wherever you may live--yes, it&amp;#39;s for and about your Freedom as well.&lt;/p&gt;" />
