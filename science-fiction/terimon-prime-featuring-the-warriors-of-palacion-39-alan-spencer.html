  <title>Terimon Prime Featuring the Warriors of Palacion&#39; - Alan Spencer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Republic was in desperate need of new worlds to colonize. But, so to were their hated adversaries The Gan. The war had already decimated half of a galaxy.
Because of the war the much sought after planet Oleanis went from being a beautiful paradise teeming with an abundance of assorted wildlife and vegetation to a savage, radioactive blasted landscape populated by a hostile assortment of strange predatory species which defy the imagination
The Dark Skinned Warrior Races that peopled the Land of Terimon had unknowingly been well protected from the savagery of their world by an insurmountable mountain range. They were unaware for the most part of the malicious and savage assortment of predators that inhabited the lands beyond. That was about to change.. 
The Mazrizch (ma-zich) was barely able to hold itself together as it drifted toward the shore. It looked like a clear oil spill with thousands of drops scattered across the surface of the lake. Slowly they began to move toward each other and eventually the creature was able to flow off of the surface of the lake and onto dry land. On its way it encountered a young Terimonian woman and her child playing in the water along the shore. Without slowing down it washed over them and continued on dragging their screaming bodies ashore in a bloody wake feeding as it went." />
