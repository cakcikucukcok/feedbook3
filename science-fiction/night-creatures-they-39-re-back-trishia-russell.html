  <title>Night Creatures They&#39;re Back - Trishia Russell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Corine thought that she and Demetrius would have time to live a normal life, as it turns out they didn&#39;t. It seemed no sooner than they stopped the felans they came back. So they were right back where they started. Dealing with the very thing that made Corine cringe more than anything in this world. They became more powerful after certain things happened to them. They learned something that they did not want to face. They didn&#39;t know whether to be surprised or upset. What Corine did know is there was hope for Demetrius and her to live a peaceful happy life once they stopped Jesiah again. This is what she wanted more than anything in the world. She wanted to be normal again, and wanted to have a normal life with the only people that was left in it." />
