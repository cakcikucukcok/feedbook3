  <title>Ambiguity Machines - Vandana Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Praise for Vandana Singh:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A most promising and original young writer.”—Ursula K. Le Guin
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Lovely! What a pleasure this book is . . . full of warmth, compassion, affection, high comedy and low.”—Molly Gloss, author of &lt;em&gt;The Hearts of Horses&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Vandana Singh’s radiant protagonist is a planet unto herself.”—&lt;em&gt;Village Voice&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sweeping starscapes and daring cosmology that make Singh a worthy heir to Cordwainer Smith and Arthur C. Clarke.”—Chris Moriarty, &lt;em&gt;Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m looking forward to the collection . . . everything I’ve read has impressed me—the past and future visions in ‘Delhi’, the intensity of ‘Thirst’, the feeling of escape at the end of ‘The Tetrahedron’…” —Niall Harrison, &lt;em&gt;Vector&lt;/em&gt; (British Science Fiction Association)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“…the first writer of Indian origin to make a serious mark in the SF world … she writes with such a beguiling touch of the strange.” —Nilanjana Roy, &lt;em&gt;Business Standard&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In her first North American collection, Vandana Singh’s deep humanism interplays with her scientific background in stories that explore and celebrate this world and others and characters who are trying to make sense of the people they meet, what they see, and the challenges they face. An eleventh century poet wakes to find he is as an artificially intelligent companion on a starship. A woman of no account has the ability to look into the past. In &quot;Requiem,&quot; a major new novella, a woman goes to Alaska to try and make sense of her aunt’s disappearance.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Singh&#39;s stories have been performed on BBC radio, been finalists for the British SF Association award, selected for the Tiptree award honor list, and oft reprinted in Best of the Year anthologies. Her dives deep into the vast strangeness of the universe without and within and with her unblinking clear vision she explores the ways we move through space and time: together, yet always apart.
