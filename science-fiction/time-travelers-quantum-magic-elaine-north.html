  <title>Time Travelers:  Quantum Magic - Elaine North</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is time travel possible? Is Atlantis a flourishing nation that exists today below the ocean? In &lt;i&gt;Time Travelers: Quantum Magic&lt;/i&gt;, Chicago, 2004, eccentric scientist, Dr. Danville Chandler, holds a dinner party where he demonstrates his latest invention, his MIM machine that sends Earth sounds into outer space. His nine guests are thoroughly intrigued as they transmit their favorite songs to other galaxies to be heard by alien beings. But something goes wrong. Dr. Chandler is also working on a time travel invention, which becomes activated and he and his guests are transported through a portal to the past, England 1692. The time travelers are: Grant Shields, a handsome former Air Force pilot and martial arts expert; a greedy millionaire, a square attorney, an African American couple, a gorgeous Chicago socialite, and Dr. Chandlers wild, irresponsible nephew, age 21. Two other scientists are with them: a Japanese quantum physicist and a German mathematician. In each place they journey through time, they must figure out how they can survive, obtain food and shelter, and how to return home. They suffer tremendous anguish and hardships, which are complicated by their many foolish decisions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The time travelers return to 2004 but are in Atlantis, a land under the ocean, where they meet a young woman who joins with them to try and find a way to the surface of Earth. On their journeys, the time travelers encounter an evil medieval astronomer, the wicked Great Magician of Atlantis, other villains, and a giant two-headed dragon. They also meet a master time traveler from the future, year 3500. This thriller is the most spectacular story on the supernatural, with: telepathy, wizardry, remote viewing, UFOs, a government black project, and a cave passageway to Atlantis. &lt;i&gt;Time Travelers: Quantum Magic&lt;/i&gt; is Book One of a science fiction trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
