  <title>The Deaduction Agency - Terry Tumbler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Witness at first-hand a group of specialist investigators, as they set up and run a new, innovative crime-fighting agency. They are dedicated to the resolution of criminal cases using paranormal assistance. This will be a new, innovative and emerging brand of policing designed to protect the citizens of our country.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read how they deal with the anti-social, disturbed behavior of a wayward, divorced husband, who is on the verge of destroying the lives of his ex-wife and their two young sons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read how they identify the members of a murderous ring of pedophiles from relatively few clues, and bring them to justice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read how they move from ineffectively resolving one case at a time, and onto tackling multiple cases with far more beneficial results to society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read thereafter how they clear the penitentiaries of criminals, starting with the most dangerous inmates, using novel means to cleanse their souls of sin, and equip them for new roles in life in special clearing centers. The objective is to reintegrate them into society, rendered capable of performing straightforward tasks and genuinely purified, via the novel process of atonement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Read how they find one talented young man who was lost, presumed dead, and reunite him with his family. Thereafter, as agents of change, they help launch him on the path to stardom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a simple, gory, two-dimensional book, but an exploration into the timely use of mediums in crime detection. It can pay dividends in assisting the fight against crime.&lt;br /&gt;
They use the latest techniques and technology in a future world not far removed from that which exists today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
