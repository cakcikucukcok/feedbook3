      <meta name="description" content="Forbidden knowledge has kept us subservient to flawed human perceptions for centuries, but the original creators are returning now to set the record straight - once and for all.  Ever wonder what Good isn&#39;t? Or how a single All Knowing Omnipotent Being could possibly exist in a universe as large as ours? Or maybe even how something as small as you could ever come to mean anything to it, even after you die?
