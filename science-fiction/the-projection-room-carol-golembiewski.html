  <title>The Projection Room - Carol Golembiewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bruce Mallory, a valuable scientist and engineer, wants nothing more than to get on with his life and leave the horrors and tragedies of the last two projection room incarnations behind him. But when he is recruited to a secret military installation in Wyoming to develop a new device, the enigmatic Agent Baker darkens his door once more. Soon after, Bruce begins suffering from a bizarre and potentially fatal condition that raises many questions, especially for his wife, Noelle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Bruce does his best to recover from his mysterious ailment, he must contend with the cold-blooded, nefarious Dr. Casper Layton, who has constructed Bruces latest version of the projection room with a unique interface. Also in his way is his estranged brother and acoustic expert, Aaron Mallory. If that is not enough, Bruce must also face nightmares from his past military service and determine who he can trust as he races to protect his wife, family, and his sanity, all while attempting to decipher the perplexing images revealed within the walls of the projection room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing sci-fi thriller, a scientist must battle to survive after he is yet again conscripted into service by an evil genius on a quest for forbidden knowledge and technology.&lt;/p&gt;" />
