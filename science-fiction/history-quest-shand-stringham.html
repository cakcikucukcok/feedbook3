  <title>History Quest - Shand Stringham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In a top-secret research facility buried deep beneath Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania, a Department of Defense project has developed the ability to travel through time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The projects primary purpose is to set up a defensive posture against a hostile power that could also develop time travel and use it against the United States. Colonel Barton Stauffer is assigned to lead an elite team on a parallel missionone sent in pursuit of humanitys lost history. In their quest to recover lost knowledge about mans past, they make startling discoveries that will challenge their dedication to the mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of the history of mankind is filled of holes, gaps, and distortions. Some of the most important elements of the human experience have been deliberately excised from history. History is written by the victors, and this elite team has been sent to correct the damage. The true history of conquered peoples has been pillaged and rewritten time and time again. While the teams fundamental mission is to explore the past and develop an undistorted understanding of human history, they may also come to the conclusion that what lies hidden in the past is sometimes best left unexamined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team faces a gut-wrenching dilemma as it attempts to balance the noble purposes of their history quest with the painful discovery of proof of mankinds past inhumanity to man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
