      <meta name="description" content="Garon planned a fun trip for Cassie. He was taking her and their friends to Earth for some R&amp;R but it was beginning to look like they might witness Earths final days instead, unless they could stop an invasion. Who were they and where were they from and why were the cloaked ships dropping their deadly cargo all over Earth?
Calling the League of Planets for help Garon hoped to destroy the ravenous beasts that were devouring all life and keep them from spreading to other planets. One of the League ships was captained by Kamarsoman the Malai warrior who held a special place in Cassie&#39;s heart.
Could the League turn the tide and save Earth and could Garon keep Kam and Cassie apart or did fate have other plans for all of them." />
