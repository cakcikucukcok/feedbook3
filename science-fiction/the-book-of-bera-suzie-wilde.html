      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born and raised in a stark, coastal village on the shore of the Ice-Rimmed Sea, Bera is the daughter of a Valla, the Vikings&#39; most powerful seers.

And learning that her father has sold her into marriage with the murderous enemy&#39;s chieftain, she is presented with an opportunity even sooner than she had hoped... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As her powers grow stronger, her visions of looming disaster become more and more ominous until she is faced with the ultimate choice: will she exact vengeance?
