Indeed, all of the carefully abused scientific terminology applied in this creative work is the decryption terminology that will allow humans and other species to safely study the 150 years of scientific and cultural progress at said colonies beginning in 2158 A.D.C.E., or upon the occasion of the U.S.&amp;nbsp;National Archives and Records Administration&amp;#39;s &lt;strong&gt;6x25 Top Secret Classification Expiration Date&lt;/strong&gt;, though the Vatican&amp;nbsp;will have a copy of this data as it arrives via an pre-funded Program, and the, also pre-funded, Trigital Studios will be collecting this data as part of the Space Static Captures Program involving several million space enthusiasts. -While presented as an work of fiction herein, it was felt to be an&amp;nbsp;sound theory, by this program&amp;#39;s participants, that the majority of the planet&amp;#39;s future astronauts would benefit of studying space from the comfort of their own living rooms prior to spending money or losing human lives on this optimistic pursuit... -Feel free to call us cautiously optimistic. The reason for the N.A.R.A. classification is simple; space and advanced science can be extremely dangerous, is very expensive, and has been treated as if it were an nuclear science endeavor by the privately-owned and privately-financed U.S. National Laboratories [Battelle Pacific Northwest Laboratories, Los Alamos National Laboratory, etceteras]. -An far more meaningful and useful dialogue on this subject for readers is the Author&amp;#39;s replacement for &amp;#39;&lt;em&gt;The Condin Report&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;, and is entitled &amp;quot;&lt;em&gt;The Robe of Stars and Dreams.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;quot; This ~600 page and photograph-rich book is an registered National Treasure [which are called Special Collections at&amp;nbsp;the U.S. Library of Congress], and explores the response to the Friendship Message in an very understandable&amp;nbsp;format.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May Peace be your Legacy!&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard W.
