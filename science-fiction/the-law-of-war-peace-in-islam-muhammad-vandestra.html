  <title>The Law of War &amp; Peace In Islam - Muhammad Vandestra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the days when Islam came into focus the world was completely unaware of the concept of humane and decent rules of war. The West became conscious of this concept for the first time through the works of the seventeenth century thinker, Grotius. But the actual codification of the &amp;#39;international law&amp;#39; in war began in the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Prior to this no concept of civilized behaviour in war was found in the West. All forms of barbarity and savagery were perpetrated in war, and the rights of those at war were not even recognized, let alone respected. The laws which were framed in this field during the nineteenth century or over the following period up to the present day cannot be called &amp;#39;laws&amp;#39; in the real sense of the word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They are only in the nature of conventions and agreements and calling them &amp;#39;international law&amp;#39; is actually a kind of misnomer, because no nation regards them binding when they are at war, unless, of course, when the adversaries also agree to abide by them. In other words, these civilized laws imply that if our enemies respect them then we shall also abide by them, and if they ignore these human conventions and take recourse to barbaric and cruel ways of waging war, then we shall also adopt the same or similar techniques.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is obvious that such a course which depends on mutual acceptance and agreement cannot be called &amp;#39;law&amp;#39;. And this is the reason why the provisions of this so-called &amp;#39;inter- national law&amp;#39; have been flouted and ignored in every way, and every time they have been revised, additions or deletions have been made in them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The rules which have been framed by Islam to make war civilized and humane, are in the nature of law, because they are the injunctions of God and His Prophet which are followed by Muslims in all circumstances, irrespective of the behaviour of the enemy. It is now for the scholars to find out how far the West has availed of the laws of war given by Islam thirteen hundred years ago; and even after the adaptation of some of the laws of Islam how far the West attained those heights of civilized and humane methods of warfare which Muslims reached through the blessings of Islam." />
