  <title>Completion of Hope - Doug Lavers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Rejuvenation Series was drafted between 2013 and 2015 and comprises four books.
While some of the characters, people, and events follow on from book to book, in character they are all different.
Rekindling of Hope (Political novel written in 2013 thinly disguised as a science fiction drama.)
Consolidation of Hope (Pure science fiction novel.)
Fulfilment of Hope (Although nominally a science fiction drama, a significant part of the book was about how to renovate the ecology of a primitive planet.)
Defence of Hope (This book has two timelines, one of which goes into the past using a backdrop of real characters and events dressed up with a fictional narrative, while the other moves into the far future. The timelines regularly intersect, and it is actually a mystery novel in the sense that a perceptive reader might guess before the end what was actually happening. A few clues were scattered through the text.)
Completion of Hope Description
With four books in the series, Doug decided to set up the stories in two paired texts which fit together naturally, Starting of Hope being the first and Completion of Hope the second.
Fulfilment of Hope
Following on from Rekindling of Hope and Consolidation of Hope, this science fiction novel describes the settlement of a primitive planet and the subsequent development of a new federation by one of the Shepherd children.
In this project, they are assisted by artificial intelligences, which are effectively life forms in their own right.
Dr. Katie Shepherd married a soldier called Hans Gretner, and the pair of them prepare to be taken together with about four thousand colonists to a geologically young planet at an enormous distance from Earth. The giant spacecraft which is to carry them is known as Habitat, and its resident artificial intelligence is called Sheila. 
No trace is to be left on Earth of their final destination, and they will have to take all the fauna and flora required to reseed a planet with them.
The Bearing continues to provide considerable help, as the successful creation of this federation is critical to their plans for further developing the galaxy. They are certain that Katie is going to have to overcome huge problems in setting up her federation.
This is a book of ecological development, love and war, disaster, and recovery. It completes the trilogy of Rejuvenation books by bringing the story full circle.
Defence of Hope
Throughout human history, most significant events would have happened through movement of peoples, food and economic pressures, or fundamental religious or political differences. In a few cases, individuals have played starring roles, and their presence or absence made a fundamental change to the flow of history.
Defence of Hope combines two storylines in a science fiction format, one of which uses the backdrop of real events and people in the past combined with a fictional narrative to describe some key divertants. The other storyline moves into the far future, and the two threads regularly intersect.
While it is a standalone novel, it uses characters and some of the events of the Rejuvenation Trilogy as a start point.
This is actually a mystery novel in the sense that a perceptive reader might guess before the end what is actually happening. A few clues were scattered through the text." />
