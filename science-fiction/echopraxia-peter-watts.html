  <title>Echopraxia - Peter Watts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Prepare for a different kind of singularity in Peter Watts&#39; &lt;i&gt;Echopraxia, &lt;/i&gt;the follow-up to the Hugo-nominated novel &lt;i&gt;Blindsight&lt;/i&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s the eve of the twenty-second century: a world where the dearly departed send postcards back from Heaven and evangelicals make scientific breakthroughs by speaking in tongues; where genetically engineered vampires solve problems intractable to baseline humans and soldiers come with zombie switches that shut off self-awareness during combat. And it&#39;s all under surveillance by an alien presence that refuses to show itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Bruks is a living fossil: a field biologist in a world where biology has turned computational, a cat&#39;s-paw used by terrorists to kill thousands. Taking refuge in the Oregon desert, he&#39;s turned his back on a humanity that shatters into strange new subspecies with every heartbeat. But he awakens one night to find himself at the center of a storm that will turn all of history inside-out.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now he&#39;s trapped on a ship bound for the center of the solar system. To his left is a grief-stricken soldier, obsessed by whispered messages from a dead son. To his right is a pilot who hasn&#39;t yet found the man she&#39;s sworn to kill on sight. A vampire and its entourage of zombie bodyguards lurk in the shadows behind. And dead ahead, a handful of rapture-stricken monks takes them all to a meeting with something they will only call &quot;The Angels of the Asteroids.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their pilgrimage brings Dan Bruks, the fossil man, face-to-face with the biggest evolutionary breakpoint since the origin of thought itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
