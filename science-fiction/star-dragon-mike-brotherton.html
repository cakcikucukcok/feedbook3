  <title>Star Dragon - Mike Brotherton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The SS Cygni probe sent back hours of video, captured by the Biolathe AI, but only a few minutes mattered--the four minutes that showed a creature made of fire, living , moving, dancing in the plasma fire of the double star&#39;s accretion disk. A dragon made of star stuff, so alien that only a human expedition to observe and perhaps capture it, could truly understand them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a perilous journey into the future, however, for SS Cygni is 245 light- years from Earth, and even though only two years&#39; subjective time will pass on board the Karamojo, the crew will return to an Earth where five hundred years have passed.  Captain Lena Fang doesn&#39;t care--she has made her life on her ship, where her best friend is the ship&#39;s AI. Samuel Fisher, the contract exobiologist,doesn&#39;t care, either. He is making the voyage of a lifetime and in the small world of the Karamojo he will have to live with the consequences of his obsessive quest for knowledge. The rest of the small crew--Axel Henderson, the biosystems engineer; Sylvia Devereaux, the beautiful physical sciences expert; and Phil Stearn, the ship&#39;s jack-of-all-trades--have their own reasons for saying good-bye to everyone they have ever known. As the Biolathe AI said, uncertain five hundred- year round trips don&#39;t attract the most stable personalities, but somehow they&#39;ll have to learn to get along with each other, if they&#39;re to catch their dragon and come home again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For at the end of the journey is the star dragon--a creature of fire with a nuclear furnace for heart. The crew of the Karamojo--human and AI alike--will risk everything to capture it, and it will take all their technology, all their skill, and more courage than they knew they had, to come home alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
