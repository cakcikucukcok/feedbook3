  <title>Jake&#39;s Law - William J. Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Out in the furthest reaches of space, an assignment was given to a race of intelligent Light beings. The assignment was to go to a faraway system and create a world and a species so that souls could experience the creative powers of living in a Free Will system. This happened a long time ago, in our terms, and continues today. However, Free Will has some quirky aspects, as Jake Montana is going to learn. Excitement and change have many
disguises, and things are not always as clear as they fi rst appear.
Jake, a mild mannered, past-middle-age engineer for a major aerospace company just wants to retire and enjoy his hobbies and life in general. Little does he know that people from another planet are actively seeking him for reasons that are critical to their continued existence. Follow Jake as he experiences the ultimate abduction by people who have medieval technology, yet travel in advanced spacecraft. Witness how dogma crushes culture and tyranny can eliminate free thought. Discover a universe where peace and war lived side by side and didnt know it until the startling discovery of space travel. Journey to the star system, where one mans desire for absolute power transforms Jakes life. Mental changes occur that are as large and mind-altering as to affect the lives of all the inhabitants on two very separate worlds. Jake will meet, and join forces with, the most unlikely group of co-conspirators -some of them human, some not so human. The difference, Jake will fi nd, is just the labels that they are given. Jump into this metaphysical grab bag of travel, fun, intrigue and
personal learning as Jake experiences the many shades of good and bad; not to mention two outstanding ladies, who have designs on him that are different from anything Jake could ever imagine." />
