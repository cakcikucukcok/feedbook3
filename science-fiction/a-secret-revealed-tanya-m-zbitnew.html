  <title>A Secret Revealed - Tanya M. Zbitnew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; The Rangers are looking for a few good men. Fame! Fortune! Glory! It&#39;s every boy&#39;s dream. Unless that boy is Camber Bloodstone, then those dreams of glory are crushed, just as you please, under the boot heel of Dega Darkhawk, former town bully and newly appointed Captain of Hartland&#39;s cavalry. He&#39;s bent on making Camber&#39;s life miserable, and not just because the Bloodstones are direct descendents of Thayne the Bold - no, Dega&#39;s hatred runs much deeper than superficial rank.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
All this bitter sentiment is about to take a backseat to something far greater than a personal vendetta. A nightmare unleashes an extraordinary gift, one that Camber would just as soon give back. This gift can level a small city, and that&#39;s not all - it can unlock the Winterstone. The Easterling King knows this - he will use the boy to deliver omnipotent power into the palm of his hand. Camber is now the prey in a deadly game of hunt and seek, and Dega, who swore his vengeance, must swallow his pride and protect his rival from the sorcerer. All hope hinges on an outrageous plot to steal the talisman and use it against the King.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Lucky for Camber, help is on the way. A trip to fetch supplies sends the cadet and his hot-headed Captain straight into the arms of Stornoway Hawker and his spell-challenged apprentice. Toss in a jewel thief, a death-dealing elf, and a potty-mouthed faerie, then send them straight into the arms of the Easterling King. It&#39;s Good vs. Evil at its rotten best!
