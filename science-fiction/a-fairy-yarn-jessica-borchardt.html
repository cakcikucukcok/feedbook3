  <title>A Fairy Yarn - Jessica Borchardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="MaryLynn ML Meyer is a present day 14-year-old who doesnt see herself as anything special. For her, the world revolves around books and her family. She may not admit it, even to herself, but she has a secret longing for adventure. Adventure finds her! One evening she is magically whisked off the country of Heinovla, which is in a world of fairies, a world ML didnt think existed. After she arrives she discovers that the entire royal family has gone bad, and they could care less if their conquering forces destroy half the population, just so they can have the entire country once and for all under their thumb.
	When ML learns this she agrees to help and becomes a spy. With her new fairy sidekicks she sets off to gather information to send back. Along the way she wards off dullahans, learns to swordfight, falls in love for the first time, and discovers an important family secret. What is it that her mother has kept from her for all of her fourteen years? After a bloody battle, will she be able to survive and enjoy the new knowledge she gains?" />
