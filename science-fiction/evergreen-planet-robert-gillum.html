  <title>Evergreen Planet - Robert Gillum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Philip Cornell grows up on an Earth covered by elevated levels of oxygen produced by an uncontrollable verdure of moss. Government decrees against incendiary technology to prevent fires have collapsed the world economies into feuding city states where swords and bows and arrows are common weapons of the time. The Conservancy replaces the United States Federal Government and imposes its authority over the land. The near future will bring death for the moss and result in global fires that will burn the earth to a crisp. With salvaged materials, the Conservancy begins the task to build survival domes on the floor of New York Bay. Trained by the greatest logician of his time, Philip takes on his governments request for him to destroy mammoth crocodiles that threaten completion of the domes. Forced to accept the help of Josiah Rhue, the salvage kingpin and henchman of an enemy high in the government, Philip increases his understanding of Rhue until he realizes this enemy poses the greater threat to the survival of humankind." />
