      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nineteen-year-olds Molly Long and Betsy Nelson have been best friends for years and are traveling to their first semester of college. But an unexpected invitation to join Joe Murdocks Interstellar Projects derails their plans. They decide its a challenging proposition and a way they can use their high ideals and values to protect planet Earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molly and Betsy are impressed with the concept of the projectsusing alien technology and the idea of trying to upgrade science and improve humanity. The projects span four other planets outside of Earths solar system, and the young women are in for the experience of a lifetime as they live and train in space and are involved in important missions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the space shuttle is involved in an accident, they are able to confirm that alien ships are landing on earth for nefarious purposes. Murdock is attempting to train his people as quickly as possible to enable them to protect Earth. In the meantime, new aliens are being discovered and discovering them in return, and Joes group must determine if they are friend or foe. Murdock and his dedicated team at Interstellar Projects work tirelessly to protect Earth from new alien attempts to annihilate humanity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
