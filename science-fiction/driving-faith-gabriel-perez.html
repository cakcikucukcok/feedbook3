&lt;p&gt;The United Government has effectively removed Gods Word from the Internet. One android, created by a Christian, holds the key to its return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One man stands in the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His name is Tom Wylie, and because of his past, he is not sympathetic to believers. He is also on the payroll of The United Government and they pay him handsomely. In exchange for their money they expect him to hand over anyone who is caught trying to undermine and destroy the Internet Firewall. This virtual wall prevents all religious freedom on the World Wide Web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The penalty for these so-called cyber-criminals and their rebellious actions is death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there is a catch for Tom. The android that holds the key to the future of the Internet is Tom Wylies new chaufferand the android doesnt care about Toms past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
