  <title>As Above, so Below - Chet Morelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Take a walk with a man named Ben C. Benson as he travels down the old,        winding, dirt road of life and death. Mr. Benson has thirteen appointments that he must arrive at on time. He meets a man named Mr. Parks, and together they travel a road that nobody knows about; a road of life vs. death, a road of creation vs. destruction, a road of love vs. hate, a winding road of GOD vs. Satan.
    	Walk down the same road that leads you from antiquity and into the future.
    	Will Mr. Parks escape from his past and does Mr. Benson hold the key to his future?
    	Together they walk down the old, winding, dirt road; all the way from the Garden of Eden, onto the Great Pyramid in Egypt, and into the futuristic Earth in the year 2020.     Some people say, The past will repeat itself. If this is true, then what does the future hold for Mr. Benson and Mr. Parks?
   	Take a walk down the old, winding, dirt road with the thirteen appointments in time. Sojourn with Mr. Benson and Mr. Parks to find out the truth of what lies upon the road of life. The question is my friend: Do you want to know the truth?" />
