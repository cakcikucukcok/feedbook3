  <title>The Missing Link - Adam Pfeffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who is the creature hiding in Central Park in New York City? Hudge Stone, a reporter with the New York Herald, attempts to find out and his search leads him to a government scientific study known as Project Dawning, which began in the jungles of the African Congo years ago. Doctor Luther Steele now heads the study and he holds the answer to what the being hiding in Central Park really is. Is he a primitive tribesman or the missing link himself? With the help of Doctor Dekko Quant, who once headed the project, Stone learns of the strange circumstances deep in the African jungles that produced the creature. His only hope is to write a story that will reveal the secret of the creature. That secret includes the medical discoveries of the last two centuries and beyond. It is a story connected to the findings of the past and the numerous possibilities of the future. A story that combines science with legend, fiction with current scientific fact." />
