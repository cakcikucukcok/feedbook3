  <title>Hypnagogic Tales - Titania D. Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For Titania D. Grace, dreams are part nightmare, part mystery, and part pure inspiration. In the hypnagogic state, the ephemeral boundary between sleep and the waking world, her dreams flourished. She brings them to life in Hypnagogic Tales, a trio of murder mysteries enhanced by the supernatural and science fiction. 
In Second Chance, a coma patient becomes the object of fascination for FBI Agents. As they begin to unravel her mysterious past, she fears what epiphany awaits. 
Within Be Wary of Wishes Erica is thrilled when Nolan, her handsome neighbor asks her out on a mini adventure in Central Park. But when her life starts to spin into a dizzying avalanche of good luck followed by Nolans bizarre comments and behavior, Erica begins to worry about whats next.
Tormented by gruesome dream images, a woman fights for her sanity in her waking hours.  When Amanda, a scared and abused child appears at her door one night, begging for help, she takes her in. As secret upon secret conspires to unravel her life, she becomes uncertain of who can be trusted. As her life begins to close in around her, she learns that there is No Room for Secrets." />
