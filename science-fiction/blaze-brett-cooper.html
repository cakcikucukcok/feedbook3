      <meta name="description" content="When aliens-obsessed sixteen-year-old Blaise Davis is abducted by his birth family, he learns that he is not a twin but a triplet, that his adoption was not interstate but interstellar, and that his birth father may or may not be the greatest villain in the universe.   After severely injuring his twin brother Wimpy in a fit of rage four years ago, Blaise is the &quot;normal&quot; one nobody notices, the one who can&#39;t stop the neighbor bully or get the girl. But destiny awaits. Blaise and Wimpy were born in a distant galaxy. Their enigmatic birth father, Goby, has big plans. When they are snatched from Earth and then lost in space, Blaise&#39;s anger becomes a superpower and Blaise becomes BLAZE - and must find out who he really is, follow his heart and control his rage before Goby can control his mind... and the fate of the universe." />
