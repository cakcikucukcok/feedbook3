  <title>The Lost Puzzler - Eyal Kless</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A brilliantly written, page-turning, post-dystopian debut from Eyal Kless, about a society hoping to salvage the technology of a lost generation, a mysterious missing boy who can open doors no one else can, and a scribe who must piece together the past to determine humanity&amp;#8217;s future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;More than a hundred years have passed since the Catastrophe brought humanity to the brink of extinction. Those who survived are changed. The Wildeners have reverted to the old ways&amp;#8212;but with new Gods&amp;#8212;while others place their faith in the technology that once powered their lost civilization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mysterious City of Towers, the center of the destroyed Tarakan empire, a lowly scribe of the Guild of Historians is charged with a dangerous assignment. He must venture into the wilds beyond the glass and steel towers to discover the fate of a child who mysteriously disappeared more than a decade before. Born of a rare breed of marked people, the child, Rafik&amp;#8212;known as &amp;#8220;The Key&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;was one of a special few with the power to restore this lost civilization to glory once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world riven by fear and violence, where tattooed mutants, manic truckers, warring guilds and greedy mercenaries battle for survival, this one boy may have singlehandedly destroyed humanity&amp;#8217;s only chance for salvation&amp;#8212;unless the scribe can figure out what happened to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
