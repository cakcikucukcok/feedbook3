The remnants of the human species have been drastically regressed into another brutal iron age, D.U.S.Ts., dormant nanotechnology permeates the very air they breathe, and the order of the &lt;em&gt;VICE WOMB&lt;/em&gt;, a matriarchal religious organization is bent on controlling the masses.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For years, Danso, a user of Direct Utilization of Small Technologies, has been a disabled slave unable to connect and use such devices, serving within the order&amp;#39;s sanctuary, waiting for the opportunity to kill his wife Nissa, a narcissistic priestess who had his pupil and true-love Gho&amp;rsquo;a murdered. Nissa also attempted to have Danso murdered in order to rise in power.
