  <title>My Half of Tomorrow - John L Dunegan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What would you do if you were given the opportunity to travel in time? Would you renew a lost relationship, look into your mothers eyes one last time, or finish school while you are young? Or would you do something more heroic, such as kill Hitler to save the lives of millions or alert the world of a natural disaster?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For all the time you have spent wondering what you would do if you could time travel, have you considered what the consequences of changing history might be? So you kill Hitler, would you fool fate, or would another fanatic simply step up to take his place? Would a simple change of the past snowball into a catastrophe in the future?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;When Johna young man of physics with an insatiable curiosity for scienceis accidentally given the opportunity to travel in time, he must face the questions that this ability presents to him. He must ask himself what he should do with this power. With the power to connect to the past and alter the future, John can change his lifeand the course of historyforever. But when he takes action, the outcome is far from what he expected.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Written into Johns legacy are the words, History is the sum of all known knowledge, including the forbidden knowledge of change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
