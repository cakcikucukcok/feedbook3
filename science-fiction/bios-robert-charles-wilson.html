  <title>Bios - Robert Charles Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the 22nd century, humankind has colonized the solar system. Starflight is possible but hugely expensive, so humakind&#39;s efforts are focussed on Isis, the one nearby Earthlike world. Isis is verdant, Edenic, rich with complex DNA-based plant and animal life. And every molecule of Isian life is spectacularly toxic to human beings. The entire planet is a permanent Level Four Hot Zone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite that, Isis is the most interesting discovery of the millennium:  a parallel biology with lessons to teach us about our own nature.  It&#39;s also the hardest of hardship posts, the loneliest place in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zoe Fisher was born to explore Isis. Literally. Cloned and genetically engineered by a faction within the hothouse politics of Earth, Zoe is optimized to face Isis&#39;s terrors. Now at last Zoe has arrived on Isis. But there are secrets implanted within her that not even she suspects--and the planet itself has secrets that will change our understanding of life in the universe.&lt;br&gt;Bursting with ideas, replete with human insight, &lt;i&gt;Bios &lt;/i&gt;is science fiction in the grand tradition:  a novel of bravery, exploration, and discovery in a universe charged with awe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
