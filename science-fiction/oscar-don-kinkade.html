  <title>Oscar - Don Kinkade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The story opens with panoramic scenes of Richard Blast making his way through the dense Thai jungle to destroy a secret airfield. Captured before being able place the explosives, he is murdered by Tanaka, the Chinese operative responsible for the construction of the airfield and the evil conspiracy that threatens all of mankind.&lt;P&gt;Robert Tokor, Assistant Director of the CIA, learns of Richard&#39;s death in a hastily called meeting in Langley. Oddly enough, Director Byrd allows Jonah, the Israeli Director to inform Robert via video conference. Robert&#39;s temper flares as he swears vengeance on those responsible. The same day Director Byrd gives in to Robert and allows him to proceed with bringing Oscar on line, a so-called new system Robert had been perfecting since 2008. Robert and a select few comrades from Langley jet away to a secret mountain installation hidden within the Cherokee National Forest.&lt;P&gt;Ms. Reed, Robert&#39;s leading lady, is at first skeptical of Oscar. Oscar appears to the Langley group in the form of a grandfatherly Roman Senator complete with toga and sandals. Oscar is forced to demonstrate his unusual capabilities, conjuring up other images and offering intimate details into the lives of some of the group which ordinarily even the CIA would not know or have access to.&lt;P&gt;Within hours Oscar&#39;s investigation is underway. Bits and pieces of the conspiracy begin to appear. Ms. Reed remains at the new facility with Oscar while Robert and a select assembly of commandos disembark to visit first hand the Thai airfield.&lt;P&gt;Their raid is successful. All but one Iraqi soldier was killed while guarding the secret Chinese airfield. During the interrogation being performed by Robert and his men US Navy Tomcats swarm in and destroy what&#39;s left of the field, killing their only prisoner in the process. Robert and his men find themselves in bewilderment, seemingly targeted by their own forces.&lt;P&gt;Robert brings up and image of Oscar there in the jungle and learns that an unknown super computer had invaded Langley and the Pentagon and that it was responsible for the strike. Reluctantly, Robert allows choppers from the Enterprise to rescue them, the same carrier that launched the Tomcats.&lt;P&gt;Robert is at first hostile towards Captain Reichenback. He explains to all within hearing distance there on the bridge that they had found Iraqis guarding a base in Thailand. Only when Robert brings up Oscar as an exact duplicate of the Captain and allows Oscar to forcefully take over the entire battle group do the sailors begin to understand and admit that Robert and Oscar must know something they don&#39;t.&lt;P&gt;Back at the base Oscar and Tami (Ms. Reed) continue with the investigation. Tami begins to understand just how powerful and omnipotent Oscar really is. They become friends of sorts.&lt;P&gt;Robert is paranoid of everyone. The Director isn&#39;t himself. Jonah, the Israeli Director seems to be withholding information.&lt;P&gt;Oscar and Tami contact Robert and explain that Oscar has discovered a super computer called Armageddon is responsible for the air strike and that the Chinese probably created the computer.&lt;P&gt;Oscar&#39;s investigation then directs Robert and his men to a pharmaceutical plant near Tokyo. It is learned that the Chinese operative, Tanaka, controlled the production of a genetic polymer created by the Japanese scientists against their will. The substance was being transported to the airfield in Thailand to be dispersed around the globe by a C-130 rigged with spray equipment.&lt;P&gt;Before leaving Tokyo, Robert meets Gloria Yakmir, Jonah&#39;s stepdaughter. She convinces Robert to take her along to Washington to inform President Bratcher directly as to what they think is going on.&lt;P&gt;Tami and Gloria meet during the meeting with the President, both jealous of the other. Robert explains his theory to the President. He theorizes, with Oscar&#39;s assistance, in the form of Abraham Lincoln, that the Chinese plan is to systematically eliminate all HIV carriers" />
