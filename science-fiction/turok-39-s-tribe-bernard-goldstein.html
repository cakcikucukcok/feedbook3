      <meta name="description" content="A SEQUEL TO &lt;i&gt;TUROK&#39;S GIFT&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
For ten years the United States had been producing air, sea, and ground vehicles using the star propulsion system invented by John Greenberg. The new vehicles were superior that it gave the U.S, an overwhelming military advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
During the U.S. build up, the Russian KGB had been frantically trying to uncover the secrets behind John&#39;s propulsion invention. Their failure was largely a result of John&#39;s, and his friend Emily&#39;s, interference.&lt;/P&gt;
The Russians had a sudden reversal of fortune when they agreed to join the U.S. led mission to explore the universe. John Greenberg was to head the international mission, and the Russians insisted he had to be based in Russia.&lt;p&gt;
Now they surely would be able to get the desired information. How could they miss? John Greenberg would be in their power; his pregnant wife, Anna, would be with him; and she was by far the best undercover agent in the KGB&#39;s U.S. operation." />
