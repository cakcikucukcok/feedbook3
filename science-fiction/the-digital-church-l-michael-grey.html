  <title>The Digital Church - L. Michael Grey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Digital Church&lt;/i&gt; is a truly unique, apocalyptic sci-fi fantasy tale set in the near future, as the earth races towards an undiscovered black hole in the heavens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story&#39;s central character is Martin Henzel, a dark and cynical Hollywood underground artist in his late-twenties, who doesn&#39;t know who he is, where he&#39;s going, or why he&#39;s here. His nightclub world of alcohol and one night stands will come crashing in around him, when he goes on a date with his co-worker, Megan Jamison, whose rich and powerful father, Nathan, is involved in a plan to commit terrorism on a genocidal scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martin suddenly finds himself being contacted by a bizarre spiritual entity that exists within the purple fire of nightmare visions, some of which are all-too-real, as the truth of impending genocide sees city after city around the globe methodically being destroyed. Ultimately, Martin will be forced to answer a deeply troubling question within himself: &quot;Can you love?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
The future of the entire world rests in the balance of Martin Henzel&#39;s damnation or redemption as a violent roller-coaster ride of terror and emotion lands him center-stage within the towering walls of the last hope for humanity-&lt;i&gt;The Digital Church&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
