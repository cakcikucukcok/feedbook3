  <title>Project Changeling - Rich Varela, Mary Ellen Varela</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack Tyler leaves his home in Wyoming to catch up with some old friends in back in New York. One of his fi rst orders of business is to have dinner with a former co-worker who could be more than just a friend, Patricia Drummond.&lt;/p&gt;
Once dinner is through, as they walk along the beach, they witness an alien spaceship landing. Patricia can only watch as Jack goes to inspect the craft and becomes engulfed in a paralyzing beam. When the spaceship leaves, Jack is gone, and an unconscious young woman wearing his clothes has taken his place.&lt;/p&gt;
Patricia and the young woman are transported to a military base, where its discovered that this strange woman  who will be later know as Carolyn  is actually a female modification of Jacks molecular genetics and was created from an image in Jacks sub-conscious. Scientists also discover that the woman ages slower than normal humans, has a unique skeletal structure and a modified brain.&lt;/p&gt;
The world is about to find out that a threat that could destroy Earth looms on the horizon, and Carolyn may be the only being who can stop the planets destruction in Project Changeling." />
