      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that Ian is aware of his family&amp;rsquo;s history and how he connects with the Time Keeper, he is on his way to a special school for gifted people. A place where he can learn not only more able his own history, but more about other&amp;rsquo;s with special gifts. He also believes this will be the one place that may have the answers he needs to bring Kayla back.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;While Ian is left being the only person who can remember his best friend, it is up to him to bring her back into history. Once she was erased from their history, everything changed in Ian&amp;rsquo;s life, including who is best friend became, Michael. Ian will stop at nothing to bring his real best friend back, which means going to a special school to learn more about his past and connection to the Time Keeper. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now, all Jax has to do is get Ian to the school, but first they have to make a stop to pick up another student in Chicago. Again, ask yourself, &amp;ldquo;What would you do to save history and your best friend even if it meant changing your own future?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
