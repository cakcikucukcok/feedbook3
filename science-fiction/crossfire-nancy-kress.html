  <title>Crossfire - Nancy Kress</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the early nineties, Nancy Kress took the SF world by storm with her multiple award-winning novella, &quot;Beggars in Spain,&quot; which became the basis for her extremely successful Sleepless Trilogy (comprising &lt;i&gt;Beggars in Spain, Beggars and Choosers,&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Beggars Ride&lt;/i&gt;). Since then she has written more than a dozen novels, most recently the well-received &lt;i&gt;Probability Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, which Booklist praised saying &quot;Kress&#39;s characterizations are as sound as ever, but many will be agreeably surprised at her proficiency with military hardware and action scenes. Very impressive.&quot;And Kirkus, in a starred review, simply raved: &quot;Kress&#39;s always excellent characters wrestle with a splendid array of puzzles and problems, human, alien, and scientific: another resounding success for this talented sure-footed writer.&quot; Now comes a brand-new science fiction epic: &lt;i&gt;Crossfire &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Crossfire &lt;/i&gt;is the story of a human colony settling on a distant planet, a colony formed by Jake Holman-- a man trying to escape a dark past. But as this diverse group of thousands comes to terms with their new lives on a new world, they make a startling discovery: primitive humanoid aliens. There are only a few isolated villages, and the evidence seems to indicate the aliens aren&#39;t native to the planet-even though they live in thatched huts and possess only primitive tools. When the humans finally learn the truth, they find themselves caught up in an interstellar war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, this handful of human colonists will have to choose sides in the struggle. A lot is riding on their decision--not just the fate of their new home, but the fate of all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
