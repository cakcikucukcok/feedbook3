  <title>The Alliance Boxset Books 1-6 - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four years ago, Earth received its first visitors from space, and the planet was thrown into a panicked chaos. The Trivators came to bring Earth into the Alliance of Star Systems, but now they are forced to take control of Earth to prevent the humans from destroying it in their fear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hunter&amp;#39;s Claim: USA Today Bestseller! Jesse and her two younger sisters, Jordan and Taylor, have seen the savage side of human nature and found that humans are not much different from the aliens who conquered Earth. When Jesse stumbles on an alien in danger, however, she can&amp;#39;t leave him to his fate. She escapes his grasp once she frees him, but he is determined to find her and give her a new life, away from this war-torn planet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Razor&amp;#39;s Traitorous Heart: The Alliance is out of patience with the violent hysterics of the Earthlings. Razor has been sent to bring order &amp;ndash; by any means necessary. Chicago&amp;#39;s factions are proving difficult to quell, and Razor is beginning to think that leveling the city may be his only option, but when a shadow warrior saves his life and disappears, Razor finds himself torn between duty and something he is unfamiliar with, his heart.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dagger&amp;#39;s Hope: USA Today Bestseller! New York Times Bestseller! When they first met, Dagger saved Jordan&amp;#39;s life. Now it&amp;#39;s her turn to save him, no matter the risk. She&amp;#39;ll cross the galaxy alone if she has to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Challenging Saber: USA Today Bestseller! Saber fears he will never fully recover from his debilitating injury, and if he cannot protect his Amate, he knows he doesn&amp;#39;t deserve her. Taylor plans to show Saber that he is the man she wants, stubbornness and all, but when civil war erupts, she is trapped behind enemy lines.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Destin&amp;#39;s Hold: USA Today Bestseller! Destin will rebuild Chicago, even if it means working with another alien ambassador. The last one was indescribably corrupt, but this one, Sula, gets under his skin for a different reason. They will need to work together to stop an alien cartel, and unbeknownst to them, a battle is coming, bigger than anything they&amp;#39;ve yet seen...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Edge of Insanity: USA Today Bestseller! Dagger was rescued, but Edge was presumed dead.... A human woman caught on an alien world will do anything to get back to Earth, even if it means freeing a Trivator.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed author S.E. Smith presents a bundle of 6 action-packed stories to transport readers out of this world!&lt;br /&gt;
