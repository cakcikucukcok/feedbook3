  <title>The Sorcerer of the Wildeeps - Kai Ashante Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Wired&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Twenty-Five All-Time Favorite Books&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Critically acclaimed author Kai Ashante Wilson makes his commercial debut with this striking, wondrous tale of gods and mortals, magic and steel, and life and death that will reshape how you look at sword and sorcery.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since leaving his homeland, the earthbound demigod Demane has been labeled a sorcerer. With his ancestors&#39; artifacts in hand, the Sorcerer follows the Captain, a beautiful man with song for a voice and hair that drinks the sunlight. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two of them are the descendants of the gods who abandoned the Earth for Heaven, and they will need all the gifts those divine ancestors left to them to keep their caravan brothers alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The one safe road between the northern oasis and southern kingdom is stalked by a necromantic terror. Demane may have to master his wild powers and trade humanity for godhood if he is to keep his brothers and his beloved captain alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRAISE FOR &lt;i&gt;THE SORCERER OF THE WILDEEPS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The unruly lovechild of Shakespeare, Baldwin, George RR Martin and  Ghostface Killah -- this was a book I could not put down.&quot; - Daniel José  Older, author of &lt;i&gt;Half-Resurrection Blues&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&quot;Lyrical and  polyphonous, gorgeous and brutal, THE SORCERER OF THE WILDEEPS is an  unforgettable tale of love that empowers.&quot; - Ken Liu, multiple Hugo  Award-winning author of &lt;i&gt;The Grace of Kings&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Wilson is doing something both very new and very old here: he&#39;s tossing aside the traditional forms of sword and sorcery in favor of other, older forms, and gluing it all together with a love letter to black masculinity.  The result is powerful and strange and painful in all the right ways.&quot;&lt;i&gt; -&lt;/i&gt;N.K. Jemisin, author of&lt;i&gt; The Fifth Season &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;THE SORCERER  OF THE WILDEEPS reads like Gene Wolfe and Samuel R Delany  trying to one-up each other on a story prompt by Fritz Leiber. That  means it&#39;s good.  Read it.&quot; - Max Gladstone, author of the Craft  Sequence&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Seamlessly knots magic and science in a wholly organic way... THE SORCERER OF THE WILDEEPS will catch you by the throat and hold you fast until the last searing word.&quot; - Alyssa Wong, Nebula-nominated author of &quot;The Fisher Queen&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
