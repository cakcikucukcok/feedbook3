  <title>The Warrior&#39;s Soul: A New Birth of Freedom - Stephen Templeton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sometimes reality mimics fiction.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s an election year, and Americans are ready to choose the man, or woman, to lead the country. Never before has the debate been louder. Can a businessman with no political experience really become President?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Warrior&amp;rsquo;s Soul: A New Birth of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; is set in an alternate future where representative democracy in America has collapsed due to lack of compromise and stalemate. The territory of the United States has been absorbed into a large regional trading block run by an all-powerful CEO. The government entity runs like a business, acts like a business, and is not hampered by the moral or constitutional boundaries of traditional democratic government. There is one man at the top, and what he says goes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Does stability and prosperity mean more to us than the sometimes messy, sometimes dysfunctional democratic process?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Warrior&amp;rsquo;s Soul: A New Birth of Freedom&lt;/em&gt; is more than just satire on current events. It deftly mixes in elements of fantasy &amp;mdash; with a hero who has literally stepped right out of Greek mythology &amp;mdash; and of course action and adventure. Romance too. Follow star-crossed lovers across the pages where good battles evil and a lost people try to find their way back.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Can the brave few prevail against the many? Can blood and hope give us all &amp;mdash; as Mr. Lincoln once said &amp;mdash; &amp;ldquo;a new birth of freedom?&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
