  <title>Cold Comfort &amp; Other Tales - David McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Strap yourself in as three tales from award winning speculative fiction author David McDonald take you on a tour of time and space. Visit a frozen post apocalyptic Earth, a galactic delivery service, and very Australian dystopia to discover what happens to ordinary people faced with extraordinary choices or challenges.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Cold Comfort&lt;br /&gt;Ice spiders, snow bears and deadly cold are only most obvious of the dangers a young trader faces as she searches for the secrets of the Elders on a post-apocalyptic Earth.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Deck the Halls&lt;br /&gt;A rebellious pilot races against time to make a vital delivery to a planet in need. But in the face of the worst solar storm in years, his only ally is a sentient spaceship who is an outcast even to its own kind.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Our Land Abounds&lt;br /&gt;In a world divided by war and wracked by food shortages, the Republic of Australasia is an oasis protected by its isolation and the Border Patrol. But, a chance encounter leaves a weary veteran asking whether the price of plenty is too high.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Praise for Cold Comfort&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;What a great story. A believable world of snow and ice, and a tough, engaging protagonist. Vanja is a trader moving between isolated settlements, navigating the hazards of a harsh environment and sometimes prejudiced attitudes towards women as she searches for relics relating to the mysterious &#39;Builders&#39;. This story has it all: ice spiders, snow bears, and terrific action sequences - immersive and beautifully paced. More! More! More!&amp;quot; - Ambelin Kwaymullina, author: The Interrogation of Ashala Wolf" />
