  <title>Transformation Survival - Brian Richard James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in the near future, a hardened team of combat engineers endure harrowing times amidst the rise of an emerging city while battling the mystery behind the United World Order&#39;s quest for territorial dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 1 follows the heroic progression of MCEC84 (pronounced /&#39;emsek eit for/) and his young family stationed at combat engineering headquarters. Common sources of conflict emerge from the beginning, challenging MCEC84&#39;s team to unite or force reassignment to another division against their will. By resorting to extreme measures, the team becomes aware of their conflicts which are much greater than an internal dispute affecting the area, the issues span to the edges of their state and country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 2 highlights compatriot-nemesis, battlefield champion, and newly appointed team leader MCEC14 (pronounced /&#39;emsek wun for/) through his quest for glory resulting in the love of his life and increased clarity on the nature of the UWO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Episode 3 reveals the turmoil pushing the state population toward total warfare. The team, lead by powerful woman MCEC82 (pronounced /&#39;emsek eit tu/), must control a wide variety of forces while enacting solutions to strengthen defenses and handle the most unexpected of exotic information and intrigue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open ended, yet insightful and informative, this novel provides nonstop thrills with a yearning for more to be continued in the next release. Join the pursuit as we explore this realm others dare not speak of.&lt;/p&gt;" />
