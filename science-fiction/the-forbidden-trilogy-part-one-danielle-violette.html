  <title>The Forbidden Trilogy Part One - Danielle Violette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the first part of &lt;I&gt;The Forbidden Trilogy&lt;/I&gt;, Gabriella and Jonathan Love had life made. After
losing their parents to an accident, their uncle Eddie took them under his wing, teaching
them everything they needed to know about surviving in this cruel world. Neither one of
them ever expected that theyd have to do things a little differently after Gabbys childhood
best friend and boyfriend is killed right before her eyes in an unexpected home invasion in
their home in Tampa, ripping their lives apart. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Now feeling hopeless and alone, the family desperately tries to mend itself back together.
Except for Gabby, thats a little easier than done. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
After months of dysfunction, Eddie has no choice but to go through drastic measures to ensure
his nieces well-being. Gabbys best friend, Sara, steps up, moving across the country with her
and Jon to a small town in Northern California, far away from the unbearable memories of
the life that she so desperately wanted to have back.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
What nobody could have anticipated was that right there in that small town was a coven of
vampires who had been waiting years to save her.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Now being faced by the sexy mysterious red-eyed man Benjamin Row, Gabby is forced to
make a forever life-changing decision that would alter the lives of all of them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Besides giving up her mortality, Gabby is also faced with the everyday bumps in the road that
only make her decision easier.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
But will becoming a powerful vampire with her new love really change what happened to
her?&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Will Gabby grow stronger and finally accept her losses, or will she be stuck with the haunting
memories of her human life for all of eternity?" />
