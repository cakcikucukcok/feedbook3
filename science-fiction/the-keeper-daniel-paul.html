  <title>The Keeper - Daniel Paul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Keeper is a fast moving superhero adventure for mature readers.
When pretty but promiscuous Molly Rose is dismembered and left for dead by her jealous husband, she is found by wealthy recluse William Chadwick III, who takes her to a secret lab in the Chadwick Institute of Robotic Technology. There Doctor Crystal, the head technician who happenes to be a former Medical Surgeon, has her missing limbs replaced with robotic ones. William Chadwick and Doctor Crystal soon discover that they have created a monster. Ripper Rose is determined to seek revenge against her husband and everyone else in Jacksonville.
After attacking her husband, she is taken to prison but escapes during a transport. She attacks Correctional Officer Michael Finn, dismembering his arm and leg. Officer Finn also ends up at the Chadwick Institute of Robotic Technology (CIRT) where he too has his limbs replaced and becomes a cyborg. Now, secretly as The Keeper, he will fight crime and attempt to capture Ripper Rose- unless she kills him first.
&lt;P&gt; The Keeper will need the assistance of his partner, Gideon Snipes, and a new ally: The Preacher.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt; Detective Barlow, haunted by a violent past case, is also hot on the trail of Ripper Rose. If he solves this case, will he find redemption for his failure to solve the &quot;Rockwell Killer Case&quot;? And will his passion to catch Ripper Rose lead to exposing the secret identity of The Keeper?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Keeper is an exciting novel filled with many twists and turns. It is an adventure that will keep you glued to the pages, from the first chapter to the exhilarating conclusion.&lt;/P&gt;" />
