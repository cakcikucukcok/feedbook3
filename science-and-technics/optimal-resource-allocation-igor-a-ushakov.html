  <title>Optimal Resource Allocation - Igor A. Ushakov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A UNIQUE ENGINEERING AND STATISTICAL APPROACH TO OPTIMAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optimal Resource Allocation: With Practical Statistical Applications and Theory &lt;/i&gt;features the application of probabilistic and statistical methods used in reliability engineering during the different phases of life cycles of technical systems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bridging the gap between reliability engineering and applied mathematics, the book outlines different approaches to optimal resource allocation and various applications of models and algorithms for solving real-world problems. In addition, the fundamental background on optimization theory and various illustrative numerical examples are provided. The book also features:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;An overview of various approaches to optimal resource allocation, from classical Lagrange methods to modern algorithms based on ideas of evolution in biology&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Numerous exercises and case studies from a variety of areas, including communications, transportation, energy transmission, and counterterrorism protection&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The applied methods of optimization with various methods of optimal redundancy problem solutions as well as the numerical examples and statistical methods needed to solve the problems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Practical thoughts, opinions, and judgments on real-world applications of reliability theory and solves practical problems using mathematical models and algorithms&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Optimal Resource Allocation &lt;/i&gt;is a must-have guide for electrical, mechanical, and reliability engineers dealing with engineering design and optimal reliability problems. In addition, the book is excellent for graduate and PhD-level courses in reliability theory and optimization.&lt;/p&gt;" />
