  <title>The Death of Reliability: Is it Too Late to Resurrect the Last, True Competitive Advantage? - Nathan C. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;Are we facing the death of reliability?&amp;#160; Some believe this is the case, particularly when it comes to reliability leadership.&amp;#160; Without qualified leaders, there can be no true reliability, and as such, companies are losing out on the one real competitive advantage available to them today.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;About thirty years ago, organizations would invest time and money in their employees to develop craftspeople.&amp;#160; Nowadays, many companies use shortcuts to try to achieve reliability, often fudging numbers to make it &lt;I&gt;appear&lt;/I&gt; that they are progressing in the right direction, or using abbreviated training rather than full apprenticeships to produce skilled craftspeople.&amp;#160; Unfortunately, they&amp;rsquo;re simply covering up the unreliability that causes them to lose ground and increase costs.&amp;#160; The misguided shortcuts used to circumvent hard work and effort are eroding craft skills.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;There are three components that are the root causes of unreliability, and, if eliminated, will lead to reliability: 1. Improper Lubrication; 2. Contamination; 3. Improper Installation.&amp;#160;Dr. Wright goes above the &amp;ldquo;what&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;why&amp;rdquo; of reliability found in other resources to offer the &amp;ldquo;how to&amp;rdquo; of reliability.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
