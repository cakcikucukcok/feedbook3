  <title>Rational Mechanics: The Classic Notre Dame Course - R. Catesby Taliaferro, T. Banchoff, A. Hahn, F. Crosson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Developed from a classic undergraduate course on the study of the motion of bodies, this volume stresses the history of science as well as relevant physics and mathematics. R. Catesby Taliaferro developed a well-attended and much-revered course during his 20-year tenure at Notre Dame. He left among his papers the unfinished manuscript for this text, which has now been completed and prepared for publication by a group of his former students and colleagues.&lt;BR&gt;Suitable for undergraduates and beginning graduate students of physics and the history of science, this volume begins with an exploration of ancient Greek celestial mechanics and the seventeenth-century scientific revolution incited by Kepler&#39;s work. Subsequent chapters examine vector spaces and their applications, elementary differential geometry, particle dynamics, displacement and kinematics, theories of light, and the special theory of relativity. &lt;/DIV&gt;" />
