  <title>Telling Our Way to the Sea - Aaron Hirsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A luminous and revelatory journey into the science of life and the depths of the human experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;By turns epic and intimate, &lt;i&gt;Telling Our Way to the Sea&lt;/i&gt; is both a staggering revelation of unraveling ecosystems and a profound meditation on our changing relationships with nature--and with one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the biologists Aaron Hirsh and Veronica Volny, along with their friend Graham Burnett, a historian of science, lead twelve college students to a remote fishing village on the Sea of Cortez, they come upon a bay of dazzling beauty and richness. But as the group pursues various threads of investigation--ecological and evolutionary studies of the sea, the desert, and their various species of animals and plants; the stories of local villagers; the journals of conquistadors and explorers--they recognize that the bay, spectacular and pristine though it seems, is but a ghost of what it once was. Life in the Sea of Cortez, they realize, has been reshaped by complex human ideas and decisions--the laws and economics of fishing, property, and water; the dreams of developers and the fantasies of tourists seeking the wild; even efforts to retrieve species from the brink of extinction--all of which have caused dramatic upheavals in the ecosystem. It is a painful realization, but the students discover a way forward. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weathering a hurricane and encountering a rare whale in its wake, they come to see that the bay&#39;s best chance of recovery may in fact reside in our own human stories, which can weave a compelling memory of the place. Glimpsing the intricate and ever-shifting web of human connections with the Sea of Cortez, the students comprehend anew their own place in the natural world--suspended between past and future, teetering between abundance and loss. The redemption in their difficult realization is that as they find their places in a profoundly altered environment, they also recognize their roles in the path ahead, and ultimately come to see one another, and themselves, in a new light.&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Telling Our Way to the Sea&lt;/i&gt;, Hirsh&#39;s voice resounds with compassionate humanity, capturing the complex beauty of both the marine world he explores and the people he explores it with. Vibrantly alive with sensitivity and nuance, &lt;i&gt;Telling Our Way to the Sea&lt;/i&gt; transcends its genre to become literature.&lt;/p&gt;" />
