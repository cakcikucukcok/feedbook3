  <title>Wind Power: Renewable Energy for Home, Farm, and Business, 2nd Edition - Paul Gipe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the wake of mass blackouts and energy crises, wind power remains a largely untapped resource of renewable energy. It is a booming worldwide industry whose technology, under the collective wing of aficionados like author Paul Gipe, is coming of age. Wind Power guides us through the emergent, sometimes daunting discourse on wind technology, giving frank explanations of how to use wind technology wisely and sound advice on how to avoid common mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Since the mid-1970s, Paul Gipe has played a part in nearly every aspect of wind energy&amp;#8217;s development&amp;#8212;from installing small turbines to promoting wind energy worldwide. As an American proponent of renewable energy, Gipe has earned the acclaim and respect of European energy specialists for years, but his arguments have often fallen on deaf ears at home.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today, the topic of wind power is cropping up everywhere from the beaches of Cape Cod to the Oregon-Washington border, and one wind turbine is capable of producing enough electricity per year to run 200 average American households. Now, Paul Gipe is back to shed light on this increasingly important energy source with a revised edition of Wind Power.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the course of his career, Paul Gipe has been a proponent, participant, observer, and critic of the wind industry. His experience with wind has given rise to two previous books on the subject, &lt;em&gt;Wind Energy Basics&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wind Power for Home and Business&lt;/em&gt;, which have sold over 50,000 copies. Wind Power for Home and Business has become a staple for both homeowners and professionals interested in the subject, and now, with energy prices soaring, interest in wind power is hitting an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With chapters on output and economics, &lt;em&gt;Wind Power&lt;/em&gt; discloses how much you can expect from each method of wind technology, both in terms of energy and financial savings. The book&amp;#8217;s updated models, graphics, and weighty appendixes make it an invaluable reference for everyone interested in the emerging trend of wind power and renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Executive Director of the American Wind Energy Association Randall Swisher has said, &quot;In the last two decades, no one has done more that Paul Gipe to bring wind energy to the public&amp;#8217;s attention.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
