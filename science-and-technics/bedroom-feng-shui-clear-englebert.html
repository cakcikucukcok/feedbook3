  <title>Bedroom Feng Shui - Clear Englebert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bedroom Feng Shui&lt;/i&gt; was a best-seller when The Crossing Press first published it in 2001. It is now available in a revised, expanded edition. In feng shui, the bedroom is the most important room. It has the most influence in a persons life, because of the amount of time spent there, a third of a lifetime. For many people the bedroom is the only room that is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book explains everything a person needs to know when applying feng shui to their bedroom. People sense that the location of the bed is important and wonder, Is my bed in the best location? The main factors in making that decision are the location of the doors, windows, and bathrooms, as well as any features on the ceiling such as beams or ceiling fans. Many different types of beds are evaluated, as well as the bedding and any other fabric in the room. Various furniture choices are discussed, especially since some bedrooms must be multifunctional. Many optional solutions are offered when problem situations are mentioned. Every object commonly in bedrooms (clocks, rugs, lamps) is carefully discussed. Some items are too yang (such as mirrors) and should be used sparingly, and too many items make the room too yin and stifle the energy. The various details, such as color, texture, lighting, and artwork, that help a bedroom support sound sleep, are thoroughly covered. No detail is overlooked, says author Susan Levitt. Chapters are devoted to special bedrooms such as children&#39;s rooms, studio apartments, and guestrooms. Even the bathroom is covered, since it is often adjacent to a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The feng shui bagua is thoroughly explained, telling the location and use of the Wealth Corner and the Relationship Corner, which are famous, for good reason, in feng shui. Harmony and prosperity are often the main reasons people first try feng shui. This book is based on Form School feng shui, not Compass School. Form School could be called the common sense school, because it is based on the form or shape of objects. The book does not discuss lucky directions or numbers, which are not a concern in Form School.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bedroom Feng Shui&lt;/i&gt; is for beginners as well as for those with more feng shui knowledge. If someone has studied feng shui, they are aware of the power of the bedroom, and will appreciate the attention to detail in this book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
