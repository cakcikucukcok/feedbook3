  <title>Almost Chimpanzee - Jon Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The captivating story of how a band of scientists has redrawn the genetic and behavioral lines that separate humans from our nearest cousins&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fall of 2005, a band of researchers cracked the code of the chimpanzee genome and provided a startling new window into the differences between humans and our closest primate cousins. For the past several years, acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Science&lt;/i&gt; reporter Jon Cohen has been following the DNA hunt, as well as eye-opening new studies in ape communication, human evolution, disease, diet, and more. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Almost Chimpanzee&lt;/i&gt;, Cohen invites us on a captivating scientific journey, taking us behind the scenes in cutting-edge genetics labs, rain forests in Uganda, sanctuaries in Iowa, experimental enclaves in Japan, even the Detroit Zoo. Along the way, he ferries fresh chimp sperm for a time-sensitive analysis, gets greeted by pant-hoots and chimp feces, and investigates an audacious attempt to breed a humanzee. Cohen offers a fresh and often frankly humorous insider&#39;s tour of the latest research, which promises to lead to everything from insights about the unique ways our bodies work to shedding light on stubborn human-only problems, ranging from infertility and asthma to speech disorders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in the end, Cohen explains why it&#39;s time to move on from Jane Goodall&#39;s plea that we focus on how the two species are alike and turns to examining why our differences matter in vital ways--for understanding humans and for increasing the chances to save the endangered chimpanzee.&lt;/p&gt;" />
