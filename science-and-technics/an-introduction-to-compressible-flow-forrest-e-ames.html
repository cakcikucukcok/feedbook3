  <title>An Introduction to Compressible Flow - Forrest E. Ames</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An Introduction to Compressible Flow is a concise, yet comprehensive treatment of one-dimensional compressible flow designed to provide mechanical and aerospace engineering students with the background they need for aerodynamics and turbomachinery courses. This book covers isentropic flow, normal shock waves, oblique shock waves, and Prandtl Meyer flow and their applications. The first chapter reviews the physics of air, control volume analysis and provides a review of thermodynamics. Most textbooks provide very concise treatments of compressible flow-this text will supplement that material, which is often too concise to provide students with the background they need. This book also supports practicing engineers who have never developed a mastery of issues related to one-dimensional compressible flow or who need to review this material at some point in their careers. The appendices provide the tables and charts commonly associated with this material. One new addition is an oblique shock table, which tabulates the oblique shock angle for the weak shock solution as a function of Mach number and deflection angle. The book includes examples of problem solutions, and each chapter has a list of problems to enable students to apply their understanding." />
