  <title>The Autobiography of Charles Darwin - Charles Darwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My father&amp;#39;s autobiographical recollections, given in the present chapter, were written for his children,&amp;mdash;and written without any thought that they would ever be published. To many this may seem an impossibility; but those who knew my father will understand how it was not only possible, but natural. The autobiography bears the heading, &amp;#39;Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character,&amp;#39; and end with the following note:&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;Aug. 3, 1876. This sketch of my life was begun about May 28th at Hopedene (Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood&amp;#39;s house in Surrey.), and since then I have written for nearly an hour on most afternoons.&amp;quot; It will easily be understood that, in a narrative of a personal and intimate kind written for his wife and children, passages should occur which must here be omitted; and I have not thought it necessary to indicate where such omissions are made. It has been found necessary to make a few corrections of obvious verbal slips, but the number of such alterations has been kept down to the minimum. - Francis Darwin" />
