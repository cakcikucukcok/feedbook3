  <title>Roof Tiling and Slating - Kevin Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you have never fixed a roof tile or slate before but have wondered how to go about repairing or replacing them, then this is the book for you. Many of the technical books about roof tiling and slating are rather vague and conveniently ignore some of the trickier problems and how they can be resolved. In Roof Tiling and Slating, the author rejects this cautious approach. Kevin Taylor uses both his extensive knowledge of the trade and his ability to explain the subject in easily understandable terms, to demonstrate how to carry out the work safely to a high standard, using tried and tested methods. Topics covered: considers the various types of tiles, slates and roofing materials on the market and their uses, how to estimate the required quantities, and where to buy them; discusses how to check and assess a roof and how to identify and rectify problems; describes how to efficiently &#39;set out&#39; roofs from small, simple jobs to larger and more complicated projects, thus making the work quicker, simpler and neater; examines the correct and the incorrect ways of installing background materials such as underlay, battens and valley liners; explains how to install interlocking tiles, plain tiles, and artificial and natural slates; covers both modern and traditional methods and skills, including cutting materials by hand without the assistance of power tools; provides invaluable guidance on repairs and maintenance issues, and highlights common mistakes and how they can be avoided." />
