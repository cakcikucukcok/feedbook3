  <title>Contractual Dimensions in Construction - Chandana Jayalath</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Construction contractors must regularly wade through complicated contractual and technical issues. Claims and disputes can ruin a project or prevent it from even getting started. While many studies concentrate on case law imported from different jurisdictions, CONTRACTUAL DIMENSIONS IN CONSTRUCTION takes a practical approach that relies on quantity surveying. This approach enables all parties involved to establish and maintain fair agreements for a dispute free project delivery.&lt;/p&gt; 
With this guidebook, you will learn how to anticipate and avoid problems while concentrating on solutions. Topics covered include:&lt;br&gt; 
 Contract formation, existence, and invalidation
 Contract and pricing modalities
 Contract interpretation
 Attributes of contractual provisions
 Defaults and remedies
 Variations, claims and disputes
&lt;p&gt;Youll also learn about the duties, rights, and obligations of the parties to a contract, as well as the issues related to commencement, completion, extension, and damages. Examples and real-life scenarios make learning about the contractual process easy.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;CONTRACTUAL DIMENSIONS IN CONSTRUCTION is for all contract specialists, commercial managers, forensic delay analysts, quantity surveyors, cost engineers, and undergraduates studying construction and surveying related subjects. Those who are interested in para-legal functions related to construction may also find this book of value, as will students of engineering disciplines. &lt;/p&gt;" />
