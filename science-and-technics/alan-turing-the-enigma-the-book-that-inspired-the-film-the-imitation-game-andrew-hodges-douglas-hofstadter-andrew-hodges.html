  <title>Alan Turing: The Enigma: The Book That Inspired the Film &quot;The Imitation Game&quot; - Andrew Hodges, Douglas Hofstadter, Andrew Hodges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A &lt;i&gt;NEW YORK TIMES&lt;/i&gt; BESTSELLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The official book behind the Academy Award-winning film &lt;i&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;/i&gt;, starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the British mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) saved the Allies from the Nazis, invented the computer and artificial intelligence, and anticipated gay liberation by decades--all before his suicide at age forty-one. This &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8211;bestselling  biography of the founder of computer science, with a new preface by the author that addresses Turing&amp;#8217;s royal pardon in 2013, is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Capturing both the inner and outer drama of Turing&amp;#8217;s life, Andrew Hodges tells how Turing&amp;#8217;s revolutionary idea of 1936--the concept of a universal machine--laid the foundation for the modern computer and how Turing brought the idea to practical realization in 1945 with his electronic design. The book also tells how this work was directly related to Turing&amp;#8217;s leading role in breaking the German Enigma ciphers during World War II, a scientific triumph that was critical to Allied victory in the Atlantic. At the same time, this is the tragic account of a man who, despite his wartime service, was eventually arrested, stripped of his security clearance, and forced to undergo a humiliating treatment program--all for trying to live honestly in a society that defined homosexuality as a crime.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The inspiration for a major motion picture starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Keira Knightley, &lt;i&gt;Alan Turing: The Enigma&lt;/i&gt; is a gripping story of mathematics, computers, cryptography, and homosexual persecution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
