  <title>Renaissance of the Subperiosteal Implant - Leonard I. Linkow Dds Dmsc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Linkow Implantology Collection Now Online at the NYU Health Sciences Libraries 
The NYU Health Sciences Libraries have launched an online collection of the work of Dr. Leonard I. Linkow (1952), a clinical professor of Periodontology and Implant Dentistry at NYUCD, who is considered by many to be the father of American implant dentistry. In 1990, Dr. Linkow presented a major gift to the NYU College of Dentistry, which was recognized with the establishment of the Leonard I. Linkow Professorship in Implant Dentistry. 
In a career spanning more than half a century, Dr. Linkow placed thousands of implants beginning in the 1950s, when dental implantology was in its infancy. The Linkow Implantology Collection presents slides and videos produced by Dr. Linkow to explain the clinical features and surgical placement of a variety of implants. A catalog of Dr. Linkows publications and patents is also featured. 
The online collection was produced by Dr. Racquel Z. LeGeros, professor of the Leonard I. Linkow Professorship in Implant Dentistry; Dr. John P. LeGeros, adjunct professor of Biomaterials and Biometrics; Ms. Karen Hanson, digital projects librarian at the NYU Health Sciences Libraries; Dr. David Holmes, MS in Biomaterials, 2009; and Ms. Rosie Corona, a Web consultant. It was facilitated by Dr. Andrew I. Spielman, associate dean for Academic Affairs and chair of the Health Sciences Libraries Committee for NYUCD. 
Every type of implant and technique is represented in this collection, noted Dr. Linkow. By putting this collection online, weve given people all over the world a comprehensive new resource in implant dentistry. 
Students, clinicians, and educators can greatly benefit from this teaching site, which not only describes the history of dental implants but also provides many surgical examples of the use of different types of implants in various clinical situations, said Dr. Racquel LeGeros. 
Ms. Hanson added, This collection features historic gems and celebrates Dr. Linkows role as an implant dentistry pioneer.
