  <title>Mind-Blowing Modular Origami: The Art of Polyhedral Paper Folding - Byriah Loper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Modular origami is the latest craze in paper folding!&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These three-dimensional models are created from a number of small pieces of paper that are easily folded and then cleverly fit together to form a spectacular shape. They range from paper polyhedra to bristling buckyballs that are reminiscent of sea urchins&amp;#151;to ornate flower-like spheres.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Each piece of paper is held by the tension of the other papers&amp;#151;demonstrating the remarkable hidden properties of paper, which is at the same time flexible but also strong!&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Author Byriah Loper has been creating modular origami sculptures for just five years, but in that time, he&#39;s pushed the upper limits of the art form with some of the largest, most complex geometric paper constructions ever assembled. While many geo-modular origami artists focus on creating dense floral spheres, Byriah has pioneered the open, linear &quot;wire frame&quot; approach, which results in a very complex-looking model that reveals the interior of its form. He exhibits his sculptures annually at the OrigamiUSA convention in New York, and was recently a featured artist at the &quot;Surface to Structure&quot; exhibition at the Cooper Union gallery in the East Village.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
