  <title>Greedy Business - Leonard Amattey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book GREEDY BUSINESS is a satire directed at human behaviour, particularly in regards to human priorities to choose between acts of humanitarianism and greed.  The author notes that politics indeed is part and parcel of life but no where is it so vividly portrayed than in education and at the work place to satisfy human obsession with greed. Then he admitted, I cannot deny my role in that but that cannot justify it. 
As individuals we allow Greed to Triumph Morality without humanitarian consideration for others in our efforts to improve quality of our life and that is inexcusable. 
This book is therefore about that aspect of human thinking that can justify individuals doing things to others that they would not like others to do them. 
I wonder how many of us find the necessity to take a step backward to explore the choices we have made to do the things we have done to others that we would not like to be done to us because if done to us they would likely destroy our quality of life. Yet some how, some of us can justify some of the things we do to others as the result of the choices we have made without humanitarian consideration for them in the name of improving quality of our lives at the expense of our victims. 
Well! I did take a step backward and my observations suggest that humans obsession with Greed confirms why we do the things to others that we would not like to be done to us.  Our tendency to want more and more at the expense of others without humanitarian consideration for the quality of life of others has blinded our moral responsibility to be fair.  The purpose of writing this book is therefore to share my observations and thoughts with others in the hope that they too may find the need to take a step backward and explore the choices made in the past to do certain things to others that they would not like others to do to them." />
