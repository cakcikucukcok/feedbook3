  <title>Statistics - Ramuñe B. Adams, Mitchell P. Preiss, Irwin Kabus, William J. Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot; Our objective in this book is to present an exposition of basic principles of statistics along with some indication of applications which satisfies the following ten commandments:
 The focus should be placed on a clear development of basic ideas and principles.
 The exposition of these basic ideas and principles should be streamlined so as to avoid having the undergrowth get in the way of the statistical forest.
 High priority should be given to the assumptions which underlie the application of statistical principles.
 Understanding of abuses, misuses, and misunderstandings which have arisen from the application of statistics is essential for a correct understanding of statistics.
 The coverage should provide students with sufficient preparation for continued study of intermediate and advanced level statistics or disciplines which use statistical methodology.
 The exposition should be readable and understandable by students without sacrifice of mathematical accuracy.
 The organization should clearly distinguish mainstream topics inherent in every basic level statistics course, irrespective of applied interests, from topics of special interest to particular audience segments.
 The computation dimension should not be given equal billing with statistical principles and ideas. Statistics is the master and, important as it is, the computation tool is the servant.
 Exercises to provoke-thought - exercise the little grey cells, as Hercule Poirot would put it - should be a prominent part of the exposition.
 Exercise banks to help the student see statistics as a whole are important." />
