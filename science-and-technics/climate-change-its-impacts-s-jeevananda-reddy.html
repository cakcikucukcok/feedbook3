  <title>Climate Change &amp; its Impacts - S. Jeevananda Reddy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The principal objective of this book is to put the science of climate change in the right perspective and help people of all walks of life. At present governments are looking at climate change as a monster created by anthropogenic greenhouse gases, a false alarm created by vested groups. In light of this, the book has addressed to remove ambiguities relating to the use of words like &amp;ldquo;global warming&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;climate change&amp;rdquo; on the one hand and on the other hand discussed their role on Nature. At present several agencies are misleading the education system and governments on the subject matter. This book provides a practical guide to students and as well to planners on the ground realities of the science of climate change; and thus it is useful as reference manual. This can be seen from the way the book is divided.&lt;br /&gt;
