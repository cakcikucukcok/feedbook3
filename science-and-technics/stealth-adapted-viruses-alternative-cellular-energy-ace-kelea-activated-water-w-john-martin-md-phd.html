  <title>Stealth Adapted Viruses; Alternative Cellular Energy (Ace) &amp; Kelea Activated Water - W. John Martin  Md  PhD.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended to help mankind realize the many medical and agricultural benefits of enhancing the alternative cellular energy (ACE) pathway.   The research stemmed from the discovery of stealth adapted viruses, which bypass cellular immunity. 
Stealth adapted viruses were implicated in mental illnesses over 20 years ago. The concept evoked political resistance because some stealth adapted viruses unequivocally arose as contaminants of polio vaccines and likely led to the formation of HIV, the AIDS virus.  
The ACE pathway is distinct from the immune system. It also fundamentally differs from cellular energy obtained from food calories. 
Rather the ACE pathway is an expression of a kinetic energy limiting electrostatic attraction or KELEA. The physics of KELEA needs to be actively pursued. 
The book consists of six-academic-style chapters followed by narratives regarding political barriers and specific disease entities. Patients support groups and other organizations will be assisted in conducting their own clinical validation studies. Let the work begin!" />
