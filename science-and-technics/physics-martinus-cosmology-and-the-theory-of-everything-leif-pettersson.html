  <title>Physics, Martinus Cosmology and the Theory of Everything - Leif Pettersson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A completely New Understanding of Reality! Presenting FET, a new model that meets physicists&#39; criteria for what they term The Theory of Everything and provides answers to many unsolved mysteries of physics. FET describes the qualitative vacuum energies, the Fundamental Energies in the zero-point filed underlying and constituting the entire physical world, explaining dark matter, dark energy, particles, mass, Higgs field, gravity, space-time and much more.&lt;br&gt;
Leif Pettersson has succeeded in presenting this complex, astounding material in a clear-cut, rational and comprehensive way. The subject is highly topical and of great public interest  it connects to the research at CERN and it also matches the presentation of science and popular science in today&#39;s media. The book is richly illustrated in color. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physicists have worked intensively for a long time to understand our physical world. They have also been struggling to unify the four forces of nature: gravity, electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces into a Theory of Everything, but so far without success. In this book Leif Pettersson presents a groundbreaking and very exciting material with theories based on the intuitive knowledge contained in Martinus Cosmology. These theories demonstrate a new model, The Fundamental Energy Theory  FET, that without any contradiction unifies the four fundamental forces of nature, and in fact gives us The Theory of Everything! Hypotheses are presented that may explain the mechanisms behind Einsteins General and Special Theories of Relativity, quantum physics with its hypothetical gravitons, Higgs particles etc. and the enigmatic dark matter, dark energy and a lot more. The Fundamental Energy Theory offers a logical, coherent key to many of the unsolved mysteries of physics, e.g. those being currently studied in the worlds biggest research project so far, the particle accelerator in CERN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book is made available by New Cosmic Paradigm (NCP), an independent organization representing and working with the branch of the intuitive knowledge contained in Martinus Cosmology that is building bridges to Science, focusing on the great issues about Life, Consciousness and Reality posed by humanity and science. This branch is especially represented by Per Bruus-Jensen, former trainee and collaborator with Martinus. Physics, Martinus Cosmolgy and The Theory of Everything  The Fundamental Energy Theory FET by Leif Pettersson is an important addition to this field.
