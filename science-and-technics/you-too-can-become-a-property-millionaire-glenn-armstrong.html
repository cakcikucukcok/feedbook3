  <title>You Too Can Become a Property Millionaire - Glenn Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Glenn Armstrong, &amp;lsquo;The Millionaire Maker&amp;rsquo;, is probably the only man in the UK&amp;nbsp;who has helped 71 people (and counting) become property millionaires through&amp;nbsp;his tried and tested strategy developed over the past decade. Glenn&amp;rsquo;s desire to&amp;nbsp;share his success and create a legion of potential property competitors is both&amp;nbsp;unusual and impressive. Glenn Armstrong guides his mentees through a specific&amp;nbsp;programme that helps them go from &amp;pound;0 to hundreds of thousands, and then to&amp;nbsp;become a millionaire in five years...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be rich to become a property millionaire!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Glenn Armstrong is a self-taught property guru, and succeeding through his own&amp;nbsp;mistakes has helped him identify what works and what doesn&amp;#39;t when it comes to&amp;nbsp;the property business. Incredibly, he&amp;#39;s happy to share these secrets to success&amp;nbsp;with anyone who will listen, pay attention, and work hard. Glenn&amp;#39;s love of&amp;nbsp;teaching is clear, and he writes as he talks - without pretension or smarm. He is&amp;nbsp;no-nonsense and straight to the point. Glenn&amp;#39;s new book &amp;ndash; You Too Can&amp;nbsp;Become A Property Millionaire - is just one more piece in his legacy jigsaw. He&amp;nbsp;wants to share all he has learned and pass it on to the property investors and&amp;nbsp;developers of the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
His new book is packed full of incredible pearls of wisdom for any budding&amp;nbsp;entrepreneur - not just for those interested in property. Glenn shares&amp;nbsp;inspiring stories about his entrepreneurial career over the decades, from setting&amp;nbsp;up a video rental empire in his 20s to becoming a cabbie after he lost his first&amp;nbsp;million and rather than &amp;lsquo;just&amp;rsquo; waiting for the work to come to him, he put in an&amp;nbsp;extra 30 hours per week to buy a car to hire out to fellow cabbies on an&amp;nbsp;ingenious rent-to-buy scheme. Glenn offers time management tips, motivation,&amp;nbsp;and ideas for success that are applicable for all entrepreneurs. He is really open&amp;nbsp;about what has worked for him, as well as the hurdles he&amp;rsquo;s had to jump over.&amp;nbsp;Never settling for the status quo, Glenn always seeks to be more creative and&amp;nbsp;innovative, to earn more, succeed, thrive and not just survive in business. Glenn&amp;nbsp;Armstrong is a brilliant example of how anyone with drive, motivation and who&amp;nbsp;is fearless of proper hard graft, can succeed in today&amp;#39;s competitive business&amp;nbsp;world!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
