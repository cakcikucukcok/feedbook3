  <title>How to Win and Manage Construction Projects - A.L.M. Ameer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book shall be of immense use for young Engineers who may wish  to have  interesting and rewarding careers  as Cost Engineer, Quantity Surveyor, Technical Auditor in the Construction Industry. It is  mostly directed at Engineering professionals, can also be useful  to have insight of the construction industry for small and medium size Contractors and individual clients who intend to build up their own villas.
 I also feel that it would be of immense help to young Engineers who seek careers in the construction industry, particularly in China, India, Middle  East where Cost Engineering has not developed like say countries such as United  Kingdom &amp; Australia where  many  university offer degree Courses in Quantity Surveying and related fields.
There is another professional case to publish this book. The Author has  to make explanation/substantiations for two issues given below. 
a)   Once the Author  made a presentation on the topic  Construction as an Option to
       international Investors ( published in Building Economics-AIQS Dec.2011) and
       made a statement that in such cases the Quantity  Surveyors can work as advisors to
       them and earn in excess of US $ 100,000/= a week.  Some Quantity Surveyors were
       sceptical or couldnt comprehend and it became joke    to  them. The  chapter on
       Tender Adjudication and Post- Tender negotiations answers  this.  
 b)  The author made another point that if someone could do Technical Auditing of a big
       project   that would be enough for his entire life and quoted a Lawyer in Sri Lanka in
       the 1960s who did only one case in his whole career. He earned so much that he
       never sited the Courts for  rest of his life. Again, some people were sceptical, couldnt
       comprehend. The  case studies given under   Construction Frauds shall give an
       indication   regarding the possibilities of the amount of savings in Technical Auditing." />
