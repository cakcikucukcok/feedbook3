  <title>Sela’An-Linau Odyssey - Diana S Raja, Kc Linggi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story of Selaan-Linau is based on the work experience and engagement with the local communities and other stakeholders of the Selaan-Linau Forestry Management Unit, or FMU. Also known as FOMISS-GTZ, it began as a pilot project of the Malaysian-German Cooperation on sustainable forest management in Sarawak from 1998 to 2000. 
The project worked with the Kelabits, the Kenyahs, and the Penans, the three major ethnic communities in the area, to introduce sustainable community-development programs. These local communities were encouraged to participate in and be responsible for the improvement of their own livelihood. The project enhanced infrastructure with a gravity-fed water supply, mini-hydro power, and public toilets. Through programs, partnerships were formed to create opportunity via a National Registration Mobile Unit, homestay, an Arabica coffee project, community reforestation, preschool, localized nature guides, and internships. 
As the project progressed, the team experienced victory and conflict in equal parts. It reflected on the historic meeting  among the ethnic communities at Brooke Fort at Lio Matoh and witnessed other events, including the court case, the mysterious death of a Long Kerong headman, and the blockade at Long Benalih. Peace missions, the proposed Selaan-Suling National Park, the conflict-and-resolution mechanism, and the win-win outcome for the local communities, especially the Penan, are explored and explained by the team members. 
Selaan-Linau Odyssey profiles the passionate and committed efforts of the Selaan-Linau FMU members and their tireless work to create a cooperative community of responsible forest-management professionals that spanned private industry, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations." />
