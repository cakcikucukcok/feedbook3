  <title>Numinous Mirrors Ii - Robert Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Numinous Mirrors II continues the ongoing acknowledgment that science is natures poetic reflection. It is well-known, for example, that with the exception of pure mathematics, the paradigms physicists use in their attempt to elucidate their experimental scientific findings are primarily metaphors. However, whenever I hear someone quote some esoteric Quantum research as if they actually know the profound mathematics or physical science behind the statement, I am perplexed! Because until one has studied physics for at least ten years and then taken advanced degrees in math and algorithms, one should not try to impress others with nave expositions (see Schrdingers cat poem). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spirituality is what I define as curiosity. It appears that it is human nature to seek answers to our questionings. When we continue to be curious, we remain in awe and wonder. What could be a better state of spirituality than to be in a constant state awe and wonder? As one skeptically questions the fixed conclusions of mythology and magic, one will discover still more awe and amazing questions revealed by the objective encounter with repeatable empirical experimentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, the poems within are an attempt of offer to myself partial illumination and still more surprise. Inevitably, curiosity arrives once again to announce more provisional questioning. Like the cycle of life itselfinhale and exhalethe cycle of science, if allowed, will continue unabated to generate awe and wonder.&lt;/p&gt;" />
