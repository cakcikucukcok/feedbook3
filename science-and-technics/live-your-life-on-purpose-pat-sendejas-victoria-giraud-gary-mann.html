  <title>Live Your Life on Purpose - Pat Sendejas, Victoria Giraud, Gary Mann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Live Your Life on Purpose is all about discovering yourself. Wouldnt it be wonderful to find the balance between the Yin and Yang, the negative and positive, in your life? The science of Feng Shui offers a way to reveal aspects of your relationships never before considered and surprising methods to improve these relationships in your life.&lt;br&gt;
Make the right decisions about your twenty-first-century life and where you want it to take you, with the answers from the ancient wisdom of Feng Shui, the two thousand-yearold Chinese nature science. Chinese emperors kept their power, health, and prosperity by following this secret wisdom of the five elements.&lt;br&gt;
Feng Shui birth charts will reveal which of the eight personality types you are: a vital and important place to start your own transformation. Which personality types attract you and support you, and which types challenge you? What kind of career suits you best; what career might you be pursuing that doesnt suit your type?&lt;br&gt;
Did you know certain office buildings and residences are better for you than others? Feng Shui holds the key to decipher which living and working places are more advantageous to your personality type, and remedies to improve and harmonize your interior and exterior environments, the spaces where you live and work.&lt;br&gt;
The Feng Shui charts and graphics in Live Your Life on Purpose offer guides that reveal the strengths and weaknesses for the individual, the parent, the business owner, or manager.&lt;br&gt;
Pat has done Feng Shui on my home&lt;br&gt;
and business forten years. There is a&lt;br&gt;
noticeable difference in the flow and ease&lt;br&gt;
of my life, relationships, and finances when&lt;br&gt;
I follow her suggestions. Feng Shui is the&lt;br&gt;
first thing I look to when experiencing&lt;br&gt;
challenging times.&lt;br&gt;
- Melodi Calderwood,&lt;br&gt;
Owner, Pacific Breeze Salon&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted my practitioners to enjoy&lt;br&gt;
a harmonious workspace. With Pats&lt;br&gt;
background in design and Feng Shui, she&lt;br&gt;
created a space that has brought harmony,&lt;br&gt;
business expansion, and profit.&lt;br&gt;
