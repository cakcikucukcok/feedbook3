  <title>The Home Energy Diet - Paul Scheckel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;With rising energy costs, homeowners are beginning to examine the energy efficiency of their own homes, asking questions about where energy comes from and how much it costs, how to choose new appliances and what options exist for renewable energy.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Home Energy Diet&lt;/I&gt; answers all these questions and more while helping readers take control of their personal energy use and costs so they can save money, live more comfortably and help the environment. Energy auditor Paul Scheckel first explores energy literacy, and then describes how your home uses&amp;#8212;and &lt;I&gt;loses&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8212;energy you pay for via:&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;Electricity&lt;BR&gt;Hot water&lt;BR&gt;Heating and air conditioning&lt;BR&gt;Windows, walls and insulation&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Home Energy Diet&lt;/I&gt; involves readers in learning about their own homes by: measuring, metering, investigating and considering habits related to household energy use; learning how to quantify energy consumption and cost and making informed decisions about cost-effective improvements and upgrades. The book explores the misunderstood concept of efficiency versus cost by comparing fuel costs and equipment choices, including the possibility of using renewable energy for meeting home energy needs. This authoritative guide makes efficiency fun through personal anecdotes and humorous &amp;#8220;tales-from-the-basement&amp;#8221; energy misadventures.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;Since energy efficiency is an investment that offers returns greater than Wall Street, readers can earn several hundred dollars &lt;I&gt;every year&lt;/I&gt; just by following the advice in this book. As a bonus, many of the energy-saving strategies described can make for improved indoor air quality and healthier, more comfortable homes.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
