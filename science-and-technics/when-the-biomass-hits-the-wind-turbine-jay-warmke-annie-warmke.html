  <title>When the BioMass Hits the Wind Turbine - Jay Warmke, Annie Warmke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel that this generation, and the generations to come face a future of only limited resources &amp;ndash; and even less hope?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this the last generation that will have access to millions of years of stored energy in the form of fossil fuels?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like the corporations and politicians are lying about how much fossil fuels remain unused &amp;ndash; and how much they will cost?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel like the system is about to implode?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s sooo much worse than that!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And sooo much better&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book traces the history of energy, from 1491 through today. &amp;nbsp;It is a remarkable story. &amp;nbsp;A story filled with one-armed bigamists, Texas Rangers named Lone Wolf hired by the governor to arrest anyone producing oil cheaper than big oil would like. &amp;nbsp;Clandestine meetings in Scottish castles. &amp;nbsp;Footraces to patent offices to steal inventions allowed to lapse by illiterate Italian immigrants (and as a result, Bell is remembered as the inventor of the telephone).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly everything you ever learned about the history of energy is wrong. &amp;nbsp;For example &amp;ndash; Thomas Edison did not invent the light bulb. &amp;nbsp;The Wright Brothers were not the first to fly. &amp;nbsp;Henry Ford did not invent the automobile, or the assembly line&amp;hellip; in fact he arrived fairly late to the entire party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then there are the formal conspiracy theories &amp;ndash; Was Prohibition an attempt by Standard Oil to eliminate competition from ethanol? &amp;nbsp;Did GM conspire to dismantle the light&amp;nbsp;rail system across the U.S (the U.S. Supreme Court thought so).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our energy history leads to our energy present. &amp;nbsp;A world that experienced peak coal (1998), peak natural gas (2003), and peak oil (2007). &amp;nbsp;Will we repeat the same mistakes we have repeated many times before?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we know where we have been, and where we are &amp;ndash; where are we going?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten predictions for the coming two decades, as the BioMass Hits the Wind Turbine.&amp;nbsp;For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why the electric car will come to dominate transportation within 15 years.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Why all the media hype regarding the &amp;ldquo;recent natural gas boom&amp;rdquo; is just that &amp;ndash; hype. &amp;nbsp;We may soon be seeing a 3-5 fold increase in prices, and shortages resulting in massive imports of natural gas. &amp;nbsp;Some boom, eh?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;How the line between consumer and supplier of power will disappear &amp;ndash; and the utility of the future may look very much like FaceBook.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;And ultimately, why energy will be free in the not too distant future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, everything is about to change. &amp;nbsp;But rather than a future without hope &amp;ndash; it will be a future without limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easy to read. &amp;nbsp;Entertaining. &amp;nbsp;And packed with more facts than you will find pretty much anywhere (certainly more facts than you will find in Exxon&amp;rsquo;s annual report).&lt;/p&gt;" />
