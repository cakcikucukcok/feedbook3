  <title>The Greatest - Cyril K. Nwozor PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, and said, Verily I say unto you, except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 18:14)
Nothing can be more humiliating than that time when the disciples should have had such contentions and in such a time and place. When just as Jesus was cogitating his own death and laboring to prepare them for it, they strived and contended about office and rank. This shows how deeply seated the love of power and authority is. Do you want to be greatest?
Have a childlike character, says the Lord. It takes no title to be a great leader. Being wealthy does not make one a great leader. That you are educated with highest accolade in education does not qualify you to be a great leader. 
A great leader is one who is humble and has a servants heart; he is one who rules, guides, inspires, and treats others as he would like to be treated. Having influence or power over others is not leadership; that is dictatorship. A great leader is that person who possesses the ability to lead others like Christ led and has potential to teach others. He is one with the ability to identify gifts and talents in others and guide them to potential. A leader is someone God has chosen and people choose to follow; one who loves and positively influences others to do things they may not otherwise do. Ideally, an effective great leader is a person who imitates Christs style of leadershipa person full of compassion, integrity, and humility and is not a dictator. Again, do you want to be greatest? Have a childlike characterthink like a child, love like a child, trust and have faith in God like a child." />
