  <title>Self Assessment: 650 Bofs for Mrcpuk and Mrcpi Part I - Osama S. M. Amin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the 2nd edition of my previous book, &quot;Self-Assessment for MRCP(UK) part 1&quot;, which was published in 2009. The book has undergone several changes and updates. Membership diplomas of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom, MRCP(UK), and Ireland, MRCP(I), have several things in common. Their part I examination at a glance: one-day examination; two-three hour papers (UK) or one-three hour paper (Ireland); 200 (UK) or 100 (Ireland) best of five questions; no photographic materials; and sat in an examination hall. The best initial step is to read accredited textbooks. After then, self-assess yourself. Read this book, chapter after chapter, try to find out your mistakes and gaps in knowledge, and then re-read what you have missed. In writing this book, I tried my best to include the commonest examination themes. You may encounter negative or positive stems (i.e., one wrong stem or one correct stem out of five stems). Good luck!" />
