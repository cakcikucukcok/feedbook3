  <title>Polymer Science and Technology - Richard A. Pethrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Polymers and composites are widely used for a range of applications in engineering and technology. Selecting the correct material which is fit for purpose is a critical decision faced by engineers and scientists who do not necessarily have an in-depth knowledge of the chemistry or physics of polymers.
This text book provides a practical insight into the factors which influence the performance of a polymer or composite allowing informed selections to be made. It is the result of thirty years of teaching polymer science and technology to engineers and scientists and provides a solid foundation from which more advanced study may be developed.
The book complements introductory courses on polymers and composites, but also contains specialist material on the chemistry and physics of polymers appropriate for scientists seeking a general knowledge of polymer science. The production of articles from thermoplastics and thermoset resins is considered with respect to the vital issue of fabrication method and a broad appreciation of the use and application of polymers is provided by considering polymers as adhesives, in medical applications and in the fabrication of semiconductor circuits. Also included are the important topics of adhesion, fatigue, viscoelasticity, basic composite design, theoretical description of polymers, polymer synthesis and characterization." />
