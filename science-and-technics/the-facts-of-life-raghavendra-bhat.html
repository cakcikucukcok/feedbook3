  <title>The Facts of Life - Raghavendra Bhat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hailing from a beautiful coastal city of Mangalore and belonging to a family with 5 generations of doctors, had an exceptionally good academic career graduating to become a Internist winning many honours, recognitions and gold medals. He joined as a teacher at his alma mater and enjoyed it immensely declaring it to be his first love. He preferred a teaching career over a corporate one multitasking as a passionate medical teacher, compassionate physician, later as an administrating head of the department of Medicine at the Kasturba Medical College Mangalore a prestigious medical college at India interacting extensively with the students (both national and international) and their parents. His teaching career involved free care of underprivileged patients whom he considers his main source of education. He was lucky to be mentored by some of the best known medical teachers of his era. An excellent communicator he authored 4 books on Medicine. He also got international recognition as an editorial advisor to 3 well known medical textbooks on clinical medicine. He was the recipient of the &#39;Good teacher award&#39; in his university. He also authored 2 non medical books first one as a pre teenager! 
His interaction with other faculty at various Medical education programmes and with the elite teaching groups on the internet enriched his skills. An association with Sri Ramakrishna Movement gave him access to selfless achievers. His blogs and contributions to local magazines reflect his observations based on art, craft and practice of social and professional aspects of Medicine naturally called &quot;The facts of life&quot; 
He is ably and efficiently supported by his wife. His 2 daughters both doctors are his chief critics!" />
