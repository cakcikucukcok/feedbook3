  <title>The Upcycle - Michael Braungart, William McDonough, Bill Clinton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the authors of &lt;i&gt;Cradle to Cradle&lt;/i&gt;, we learn what&#39;s next: The Upcycle&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Upcycle&lt;/i&gt; is the eagerly awaited follow-up to &lt;i&gt;Cradle to Cradle&lt;/i&gt;, one of the most consequential ecological manifestoes of our time. Now, drawing on the green living lessons gained from 10 years of putting the Cradle to Cradle concept into practice with businesses, governments, and ordinary people, William McDonough and Michael Braungart envision the next step in the solution to our ecological crisis: We don&#39;t just use or reuse and recycle resources with greater effectiveness, we actually improve the natural world as we live, create, and build. &lt;br&gt;     For McDonough and Braungart, the questions of resource scarcity and sustainability are questions of design. They are practical-minded visionaries: They envision beneficial designs of products, buildings, and business practices--and they show us these ideas being put to use around the world as everyday objects like chairs, cars, and factories are being reimagined not just to sustain life on the planet but to &lt;i&gt;grow it&lt;/i&gt;. It is an eye-opening, inspiring tour of our green future  as it unfolds in front of us.&lt;br&gt;     &lt;i&gt;The Upcycle&lt;/i&gt; is as ambitious as such classics as Rachel Carson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Silent Spring&lt;/i&gt;--but its mission is very different. McDonough and Braungart want to turn on its head our very understanding of the human role on earth: Instead of protecting the planet from human impact, why not redesign our activity to improve the environment? We can have a beneficial, sustainable footprint. Abundance for all. The goal is within our reach.&lt;/p&gt;" />
