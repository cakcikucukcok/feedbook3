  <title>Newton&#39;s Darkness: Two Dramatic Views - Carl Djerassi, DAVID PINNER</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x201D;What purpose is served by showing that England&amp;#x0027;s greatest natural philosopher is flawed &amp;#x2026; like other mortals?&amp;#x201D; asks one of the characters in &lt;i&gt;Newton&amp;#x0027;s Darkness&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;#x201C;We need unsullied heroes!&amp;#x201D; But what if the hero is sullied? At stake is an issue that is as germane today as it was 300 years ago: &lt;i&gt;a scientist&amp;#x0027;s ethics must not be divorced from scientific accomplishments&lt;/i&gt;. There is probably no other scientist of whom so many biographies and other historical analyses have been published than Isaac Newton &amp;#x2014; all of them in the standard format of documentary prose because of their didactic purpose to transmit historical information. &lt;i&gt;Newton&amp;#x0027;s Darkness&lt;/i&gt;, however, illuminates the darker aspects of Newton&amp;#x0027;s persona through two historically grounded plays dealing with two of the bitterest struggles in the history of science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name of Isaac Newton appears in virtually every survey of the public&amp;#x0027;s choice for the most important persons of the second millennium. Yet the term &amp;#x201C;darkness&amp;#x201D; can be applied to much of Newton&amp;#x0027;s personality. Adjectives that have been used to describe facets of his personality include &amp;#x201C;remote&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;lonely&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;secretive&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;introverted&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;melancholic&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;humorless&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;puritanical&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;cruel&amp;#x201D;, &amp;#x201C;vindictive&amp;#x201D; and, perhaps worst of all, &amp;#x201C;unforgiving&amp;#x201D;. The trait most relevant to the present book is Newton&amp;#x0027;s obsessively competitive nature, which was often out of proportion to the warranted facts, as demonstrated in three of Newton&amp;#x0027;s best-known bitter conflicts: with the physicist Robert Hooke, the astronomer royal John Flamsteed, and a German contemporary of almost equal intellectual prowess, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz &amp;#x2014; the last fight eventually turning into an England vs Continental Europe competition. It is two of these three relentless drawn-out battles that are illuminated in &lt;i&gt;Newton&amp;#x0027;s Darkness&lt;/i&gt; in the form of historically grounded drama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a summary of the historical evidence, the book starts with the Newton-Hooke struggle (Chapter 2), which was conducted &lt;i&gt;mano a mano&lt;/i&gt;, and is then followed by little-known aspects of the Newton-Leibniz confrontation (Chapter 3), which was fought largely through surrogates &amp;#x2014; notably the infamous, anonymous committee of 11 Fellows of the Royal Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contents: &lt;/b&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Introduction: Flawed Genius&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;First View: Two Principals&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Second View: Three Minions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Readership: &lt;/b&gt;Undergraduate and graduate students interested in history of science and of literature, general readers interested in biographical history, and theatre-goers.&lt;br&gt;" />
