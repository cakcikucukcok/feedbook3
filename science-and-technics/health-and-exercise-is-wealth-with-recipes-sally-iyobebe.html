  <title>Health and Exercise Is Wealth with &quot;Recipes&quot; - Sally Iyobebe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When I wrote my first book on healthy eating and lifestyle, it was all about trying to lose weight, but a lot of readers suggested that I should write about the type of food diet and exercises that are necessary to achieve healthy eating and lifestyle. So I decided to write this book in answer to the many suggestions from my readers.
So I decided to bring into play my vast experience as a graduate of home economics from the College of Agriculture, Yandev-Gboko, Gboko, Benue State, Nigeria, and as an Owner/CEO of Caesars Palace Restaurant, Gboko, Benue State, Nigeria. I taught food and nutrition at Government Girls College, Mabera, Sokoto State, Nigeria.
The question of what actually prompted me in writing this book is because I saw myself lose my nickname Figure Eight to Out of Shape, of which I could not explain and inflicted with a lot of body and knees pains, and I said to myself, Something needs to be done.
The first time I decided to lose weight, I joined the Virgin Miles Club and started exercising seriously until I was able to cut down seventy pounds in six months. This was done through determination by eating right and exercising, coupled with fasting and prayer. I grow my own organic vegetables, cook my own food, and fast and pray, not Daniel fasting, but 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. and sometimes three to seven days dry fasting with water on the third day. It will not harm you but build upon your spiritual life.
I understand a lot of people hate cooking because of the hassle in it. You do not have to cook every day. Cook enough that you can store for a couple of days in your refrigerator and heat it up whenever you want to eat or hungry and try to discourage yourself from eating all the ready-made food in the cans because you do not know who and how it was cooked and especially the environment. As you know, nothing good comes easy. You go for the entire hamburger, it is easy to add so much weight, but at the end of the day, you pay so much to lose it or if at all.
This book is full of different recipes mostly from Africa, but I tell you it is worthwhile going for it because you will never regret it and I will be willing to put you through on any of the recipe you may want to try your hands on. And will also help locate where you can buy the stuff.
In the area of exercises, I will be willing to exercise with you, only if you are ready and willing to help yourself. Fasting is my passion. How you want it just let me know to help you out, I am always ready. Check the different types in the book.
While I acknowledge those who are out there trying to sell the get slim capsule or pills, I will urge you to do it the natural by exercising, eat right by cooking your own food and by making good life choices, and at the same time fasting once in a while and you will definitely see a better you.
So let us get board the ship and lose weight for health and wealth." />
