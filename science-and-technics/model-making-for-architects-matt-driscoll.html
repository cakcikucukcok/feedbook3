      <meta name="description" content="Model making is a beautiful and skilful craft, and architectural model making is a vital part of the building process. The architectural model is often the first time that a building is visualized in 3D. It can capture the excitement of the architect&#39;s vision but can also reveal unforeseen difficulties. Model Making for Architects explains the role of the model within the architectural and planning process. It advises on the many ways of representing a building and the many techniques of making a model. With practical instruction throughout, it is an invaluable tool both for the model maker and for the architect seeking to commission a model of their building. With contributions from leading practictioners, case studies on multi-million pound projects and step-by-step exercises, this new book provides a unique insight into the process of architectural model making, and looks at the new technology and opportunities available to the model maker. What and who is an architectural model for? What type of model should be used, and when? What scale is most appropriate? These questions are answered in this new book which provides a unique insight into the process of architectural model making. Illustrated with examples of top models of multi-million pound projects. Will be invaluable for architectural model makers, architects, surveyors and interior designers. Superbly illustrated with 227 colour photographs. Matt Driscoll is the founding director of Base Models, reknowned for creating beautiful, yet practical architectural models." />
