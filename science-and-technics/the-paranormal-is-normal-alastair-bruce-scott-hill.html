  <title>THE PARANORMAL IS NORMAL - Alastair Bruce Scott -Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is written by a professional engineer dedicated to science - he chose his standard test for validity by accepting solely &amp;ldquo;solid&amp;rdquo; science i.e. documented replicated science experiments (performed by some of the most brilliant scientist involved in quantum physics research, and others), as the base for his investigations into Reincarnation, the Paranormal and the possibility of an afterlife and immortality for all. The book was written as a sequel to the personal journey of inquiry by the author which commenced some 15 years ago, but which was abandoned until relatively recent research provided the science breakthroughs that has now allowed its completion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book is unique and a milestone in its genre, in that it gives welcome scientific support to the public majority who believe in a creator, an afterlife, psychics, mediums and the paranormal. All of these are covered in considerable detail in this book with a constant focus on science validation. This treatment also embraces other big questions in life particularly whether mind, our soul and senses can likely survive death; evolution &amp;ndash; scientifically fact or fiction; whether life could exist before the Big Bang; and even whether a timeless afterlife existence is scientifically plausible? And many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although a science book, it has been written with considerable attention to clarity, so that it is readable and understandable to all.&lt;br /&gt;
